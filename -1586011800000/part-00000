However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.{{sfnm|1a1=Linzey|1y=2002|2a1=Morris|2y=2002}} Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant [[equality of sacrifice]] and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore a \"mild form of robbery\".{{sfn|Pellerin|2009}}\n\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Hill|2y=2020|2p=52}} Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nIn the case of [[Oxford University]], Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}}\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]],{{sfn|Schwartz|2012|page=219}} writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1a2=Saunders|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer!

After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies.

Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Rosselli|1y=1994|2a1=Steger|2y=2006|2p=146}} In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=99}}\n\nWhile appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \"bourgeois capitalism\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}} that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}}}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole.

His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} He argued that \"[i]n no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and amoral nihilism.

However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}\n\nMill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.{{sfn|Bentham|Mill|2004|p=11}} Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Hill|2y=2020|2p=52}} Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,{{sfn|Wilson|2007|loc=\"Political Economy\"}} albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour.{{sfn|Mill|1852|loc=\"On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14\"|ps=. The passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition which is acknowledged in this edition's footnote 8: \"This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: \"It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.\"}}\n\nIn the case of [[Oxford University]], Mill's ''Principles of Political Economy'', first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by [[Alfred Marshall]]'s ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]''. As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles of Economy'' dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.{{sfn|Ekelund Jr.|H\u00e9bert|1997|p=172}}\n\nIn later editions of ''Principles of Political Economy'', Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|1loc=\"Political Economy\"|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice. He offers a powerful account of economic injustice and justice that is centered on his understanding of freedom and its conditions.\"}} At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperatives]],{{sfn|Schwartz|2012|page=219}} writing: <blockquote>The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.{{sfn|Mill|1848|loc=\"IV.7.21.\"|ps=none}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Ethical socialism ====\n[[File:R. H. Tawney.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[R. H. Tawney]], founder of [[ethical socialism]]]]\nLiberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as [[ethical socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Dearlove|1a2=Saunders|1y=2000|1p=427|2a1=Thompson|2y=2006|2p=52}} A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to [[rationalist]] and [[historical materialism|materialist]] grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both [[public enterprise]] as well as [[Social responsibility|socially responsible]] [[private enterprise]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialism was founded by [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] [[R. H. Tawney]] and its ideals were also connected to [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] and [[Guild socialism|guild-socialist]] values.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=52, 58, 60}}\n\nIt emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and [[social justice]] while opposing possessive [[individualism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=52}} He opposed what he called the \"acquisitive society\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \"functionless owners\"\u2014[[rentier capitalism|capitalist rentiers]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=58}} He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of [[progressive taxation]] to redistribute these funds to provide [[social welfare]], including [[public health care]], [[public education]] and [[public housing]].{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nTawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=59}} Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=60\u201361}} Ethical socialist [[Thomas Hill Green]] supported the right of [[equal opportunity]] for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \"[[property rights]] of the few\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=35}}\n\nEthical socialism is an important ideology of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s.{{sfn|Howell|2006|pp=130\u2013132}} Half a century after Attlee's tenure, [[Tony Blair]], another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\".{{sfn|Jackson|Tansey|2008|p=97}} Influenced by Attlee and [[John Macmurray]] (who himself was influenced by Green),{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents\u2014with an  emphasis on the [[common good]], rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=189\u2013190}} Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=72}} However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism.{{sfn|Eliott|Faucher-King|Le Gal\u00e8s|2010|p=18}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] (1969\u20131974)]]\nAn early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by [[Franz Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}} Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the [[social liberalism]] that was pursued by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Ludwig Erhard]], who said the following: \"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the [[social market economy]]\u2014as perfect or imperfect as it might be\u2014continues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer\".{{sfn|Rep|2000|p=238}}\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), a [[reformist socialist]] political party that was up to then based upon [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist Marxism]], began a transition away from Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the [[Sopade]]. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} {{ill|Curt Heyer|de}}, a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of [[Weimar Republic]] [[social democracy]] (a form of liberal [[democratic socialism]]) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219\u2013220}} After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's [[Godesberg Program]] in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism ({{lang-de|freiheitlicher Sozialismus}}).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist.{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=104}}\n\n=== Italy ===\n[[File:Carlo Rosselli 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carlo Rosselli]]]]\nItalian socialist [[Carlo Rosselli]] was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of [[social democracy]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], who defined socialism as \"organised liberalism\". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism ({{lang-it|socialismo liberale}}).{{sfnm|1a1=Rosselli|1y=1994|2a1=Steger|2y=2006|2p=146}} In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist [[Werner Sombart]] in ''Der modern Kapitalismus'' (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=99}}\n\nWhile appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the [[bourgeoisie]] to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \"bourgeois capitalism\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially\u2014collectivist, centralising socialism\u2014has been defeated\".{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=53}} Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work ''[[On Liberty]]'' prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nAn important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its [[anti-fascism]].{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli opposed [[fascism]] and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli founded [[Giustizia e Libert\u00e0]] as a [[resistance movement]] founded in the 1930s in opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist regime in Italy]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1981|p=224}} [[Ferruccio Parri]]\u2014who later became [[Prime Minister of Italy]]\u2014and [[Sandro Pertini]]\u2014who later became [[President of Italy]]\u2014were among Giustizia e Libert\u00e0's leaders.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=51}} Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw [[Benito Mussolini]] as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment.{{sfn|Di Scala|1996|p=87}} Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on [[Piazza Venezia]] where Mussolini resided.{{sfn|Dombroski|2001|p=122}} Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Pertini ritratto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Pertini]], [[President of Italy]] (1978\u20131985)]]\nAfter Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by {{ill|Guido Calogero|it}}.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism ({{lang-it|liberalsocialismo}}) that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies.{{sfn|Bresser-Pereira|2004|p=84}} Calogero created the \"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\" in 1940{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}} that stated the following: {{quote|At the basis of liberalsocialism stands the concept of the substantial unity and identity of ideal reason, which supports and justifies socialism in its demand for justice as much as it does liberalism in its demand for liberty. This ideal reason coincides with that same ethical principle to whose rule humanity and civilization, both past and future, must always measure up. This is the principle by which we recognize the personhood of others in contrast to our own person and assign to each of them a right to own their own.{{sfn|Bastow|Martin|2003|p=84}}}}\n\nAfter World War II, [[Ferruccio Parri]] of the liberal socialist [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]] briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|pp=59\u201360, 236}} In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.{{sfn|Pugliese|1999|p=236}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Chantal Mouffe]] is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism.{{sfn|Coper\u00edas-Aguilar|2000|p=39}} She describes liberal socialism as the following: {{quote|To deepen and enrich the pluralist conquests of liberal democracy, the articulation between political liberalism and individualism must be broken, to make possible a new approach to individuality that restores its social nature without reducing it to a simple component of an organic whole.

His criticism of [[orthodox Marxism]] was centered on its mechanical and value-free and amoral methodology.{{sfn|Litv\u00e1n|2006|p=199}} He argued that \"[i]n no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and amoral nihilism.

It is coextensive with the [[provinces of Spain|province]] of Asturias and contains some of the territory that was part of the larger [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. Divided into eight [[Comarcas of Asturias|''comarcas'']] (counties), the autonomous community of Asturias is bordered by [[Cantabria]] to the east, by [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] ([[Castile and Le\u00f3n]]) to the south, by [[Province of Lugo|Lugo]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) to the west, and by the [[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Cantabrian Sea|Cantanbric sea]]) to the north.\n\nAsturias is situated in a mountainous setting with vast greenery and lush vegetation, making it part of [[Green Spain]]. The region has a [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]]. It receives plenty of annual rainfall and little sunshine by Spanish standards and has very moderated seasons, most often averaging in the lower 20's [[celsius]]. Heat waves are rare due to mountains blocking southerly winds. Winters are very mild for the latitude, especially near sea level.\n\nThe most important cities are the communal capital, [[Oviedo]] (''Uvi\u00e9u''), the seaport and largest city [[Gij\u00f3n]] (''Xix\u00f3n''), and the industrial town of [[Avil\u00e9s]]. Other [[List of municipalities in Asturias|municipalities in Asturias]] include [[Cangas de On\u00eds]] (''Cangues d'On\u00eds''), [[Cangas del Narcea]], [[Goz\u00f3n]], [[Grado, Asturias|Grado]] (''Grau'' or ''Grao''), [[Langreo]] (''Llangr\u00e9u''), [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]], [[Laviana]] (''Llaviana''), [[Lena, Asturias|Lena]] (''\u1e36\u1e37ena''), [[Llanes]], [[Mieres, Asturias|Mieres]], [[Siero]], [[Vald\u00e9s, Asturias|Vald\u00e9s]], [[Vegadeo]] (''A Veiga''), and [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]] (''see also [[List of municipalities in Asturias|List of municipalities]] and [[Comarcas of Asturias|comarcas in Asturias]]'').\n\nAsturias is also home of the [[Princess of Asturias Awards]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Termes romanes de Gij\u00f3n 03.JPG|upright|thumbnail|left|Roman thermae in Gij\u00f3n]]\n{{See also|Asturian architecture}}\n<!-- Note: parts of this section have been translated from the Spanish version of this page, at: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principado_de_Asturias -->\nAsturias was inhabited, first by ''[[Homo erectus]]'', then by [[Neanderthals]]. Since the [[Lower Paleolithic]] era, and during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], Asturias was characterized by cave paintings in the eastern part of the area. In the [[Mesolithic]] period, a native culture developed, that of the ''Asturiense'', and later, with the introduction of the [[Bronze Age]], [[megalith]]s and [[tumulus|tumuli]] were constructed. In the [[Iron Age]], the territory came under the cultural influence of the [[Celts]]; the local Celtic peoples, known as the [[Astur]]es, were composed of tribes such as the ''Luggones'', the ''Pesicos'', and others, who populated the entire area with ''[[castro (village)|castros]]'' (fortified hill-towns). Today the [[Astur]] Celtic influence persists in [[toponym|place names]], such as those of rivers and mountains.\n[[File:Iglesia de Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco.jpg|thumbnail|right|Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco, ancient palace of Asturian Kings, 842 AD. Many churches of Asturias are among the [[List of oldest church buildings#Europe|oldest churches of Europe since Early Middle Ages]].]]\nWith the conquest of Asturias by the [[Roman empire|Romans]] under [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] (29\u201319 BC), the region entered into recorded history. The Astures were subdued by the Romans but were never fully conquered. After several centuries without foreign presence, they enjoyed a brief revival during the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century AD, resisting [[Suebi|Suevi]] and [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] raids throughout the 5th Century AD, ending with the [[Moorish invasion of Spain]]. However, as it had been for the Romans and Visigoths, the Moors did not find mountainous territory easy to conquer, and the lands along Spain's northern coast never fully became part of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Rather, with the beginning of the Moorish conquest in the 8th century, this region became a refuge for Christian nobles, and in 722, a ''de facto'' independent kingdom was established, the ''[[Kingdom of Asturias|Regnum Asturorum]]'', which was to become the cradle of the incipient ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest).\n\nIn the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], and during the [[Middle Ages]] the geographic isolation of the territory made historical references scarce. Through the rebellion of [[Henry II of Castile]] in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. The most famous proponents of independence were Gonzalo Pel\u00e1ez and [[Queen Urraca]], who, while achieving significant victories, were ultimately defeated by [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] troops. After its integration into the [[Kingdom of Spain]], Asturias provided the Spanish court with high-ranking aristocrats and played an important role in the colonisation of America. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled [[Prince of Asturias]]. In the 16th century, the population reached 100,000 for the first time, and within another century that number would double due to the arrival of American [[maize|corn]].\n\n[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]]]]\nIn the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the [[Enlightenment Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]]. The renowned [[Galician people|Galician]] thinker [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro|Benito de Feij\u00f3o]] settled in the [[Benedictine]] [[Monastery]] of [[San Vicente de Oviedo]]. [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], a [[polymath]] and prominent reformer and politician of the late 18th century, was born in the seaside town of [[Gij\u00f3n]].\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Asturias was the first Spanish province to rise up against the French following the abdication of King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] on 10 May 1808. Riots began in Oviedo and on 25 May the local government formally declared war on [[Napoleon]] with 18,000 men called to arms to resist invasion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oman |first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Oman|year=1902 |title=A History of the Peninsular War |volume=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.278497/2015.278497.A-History#page/n89/mode/2up|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=65}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of [[Nal\u00f3n (comarca)|Nal\u00f3n]] and [[Caudal (Asturian comarca)|Caudal]]. At the same time, there was significant migration to [[Americas|the Americas]] (especially [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Mexico]]); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the [[West Indies]] and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.\n\n[[File:NE 800ad.jpg|thumb|Location of Asturias and its neighbors in 800 AD]]\nAsturias played an important part in the events that led up to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In October 1934 Asturian miners and other workers staged an armed uprising  (see [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|Revolution of Asturias]]) to oppose the coming to power of the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right|right-wing CEDA]] party, which had obtained three ministerial posts in the centralist government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. For a month, a Popular Front Committee exercised control in southern Asturias, while local workers committees sprang up elsewhere in the region. A war committee dominated by [[anarcho-syndicalist]] supporters took power in Oviedo . Troops under the command of a then unknown general named [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco Bahamonde]] were brought from [[Spanish Morocco]] to suppress the revolt. Franco applied tactics normally reserved for overseas colonies, using troops of the [[Spanish Legion]] and [[Regulares|Moroccan troops]]: ferocious oppression followed.\n\nAs a result, Asturias remained loyal to the republican government during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and was the scene of an extraordinary defence in extreme terrain, the [[Battle of El Mazuco]]. With Franco eventually gaining control of all Spain, Asturias \u2014 traditionally linked to the [[Spanish Crown]] \u2014 was known merely as the \"Province of Oviedo\" from 1939 until Franco's death in 1975. The province's name was restored fully after the return of democracy to Spain, in 1977. In the 50s and 60s the industrial progress of Asturias continued with the constitution of national enterprises like [[Ensidesa]] and Hunosa, but the 80s was the decade of a dramatic [[industrial restructuring]].\n\nOn 30 December 1981,<ref name=lavozdeasturias>{{cite news|title=Fallece Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez |url=http://www.redasturias.com/asturias/Fallece-Rafael-Fernandez_0_392960711.html |work=[[La Voz de Asturias]] |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2011-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715164353/http://www.redasturias.com/asturias/Fallece-Rafael-Fernandez_0_392960711.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref> Asturias became an autonomous community within the decentralised territorial structure established by the Constitution of 1978.

Other notable features of this predominantly limestone range are the [[Redes Natural Park|Parque Natural de Redes]] in the central east, the central Ubi\u00f1as south of [[Oviedo]], and the [[Somiedo Natural Park|Parque Natural de Somiedo]] in the west. The Cantabrian mountains offer opportunities for activities such as climbing, walking, skiing and caving, and extend some {{Convert|200|km|mi}} in total, as far as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] province to the west of Asturias and [[Cantabria]] province to the east. Similar opportunities are available for the traveler of Asturias interested in [[Caldoveiro Peak]].\n\nThe Asturian coastline is extensive, with hundreds of beaches, coves and natural sea caves. Notable examples include the Playa del Silencio (''Beach of Silence'') near the fishing village of Cudillero (west of [[Gij\u00f3n]]), as well as the many beaches surrounding the summer resort of Llanes, such as the Barro, Ballota and Torimbia (the latter a predominantly [[nudist]] beach). Most of Asturias's beaches are sandy, clean, and bordered by steep cliffs, on top of which it is not unusual to see grazing livestock.\n\n[[File:Playa de Torimbia.jpg|thumb|Torimbia beach, [[Llanes]] ]]\nThe key features of Asturian geography are its rugged coastal cliffs and the mountainous interior.\nThe climate of Asturias is heavily marked by the gulf stream. Falling within the Cantabrian belt known as Green Spain it has high precipitations all year round. Summers are mild and, on the coast, winters also have relatively benign temperatures, rarely including frost. The cold is especially felt in the mountains, where snow is present from October till May. Both rain and snow are regular weather features of Asturian winters. In coastal or near-coastal areas, daytime high temperatures generally average around {{convert|12|C|F}} \u2013 {{convert|13|C|F}} during winter and {{convert|22|C|F}} \u2013 {{convert|23|C|F}} in summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1249I&k=ast |title=Standard climate values for Oviedo |work=[[Agencia Estatal de

The [[Asturian language]], also known as Bable, is also spoken, and is protected by law (''Ley 1/1998, de 23 de marzo, de uso y promoci\u00f3n del bable/asturiano'' \u2014 \"Law 1/1998, of 23 March, of Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian\"). It is sometimes used by the Asturian [[civil service]]. In the western part of Asturias, [[Eonavian]] is also spoken, and its promotion also falls under the responsibility of Law 1/1998. Whether Eonavian is a [[dialect continuum]] or a variety of [[Galician language]], however, is a subject of debate, and its use in the Asturian Administration is minor compared to the use of the Asturian language. Within Asturias, there is an ongoing process to establish [[place names]] in Asturian and Eonavian dialects.\n\n==Politics==\nThe organisation and political structure of Asturias is governed by the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Principality of Asturias]], in force since 30 January 1982. According to the Statute, the institutional bodies of the Principality of Asturias are three: the [[Council of Government of the Principality of Asturias|Council of Government]], the [[General Junta of the Principality of Asturias|General Junta]] and [[President of the Principality of Asturias|President]]. The form of government of the Principality is [[Parliamentarism|Parliament]]: The General Junta is the [[legislature]] to choose, on behalf of the Asturian people, the President of the Principality of Asturias. The President is also the one of the Council of Government, the head of [[executive power]], and politically answerable to the General Junta.\n\nThe functions of the General Junta are the approval of budgets, and the direction and control of the action of the Council of Government. It is composed of 45 deputies, elected for four years through theuniversal suffrage within a system proportional representation that the allocation of deputies is based on D'Hondt method.\n\n===Results of the elections to the General Junta===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Deputies in General Junta since 1983\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; width:100%; float:left; border:0; margin-top:-1px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#FDFDFD;\"| ''Key to parties''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:95%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white;\"|\n{{colbegin|colwidth=12.5em}}\n{{legend|{{Podemos Asturias/meta/color}}|[[Podemos_(Spanish_political_party)|Podemos]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Communist Party of Asturias/meta/color}}|[[Communist Party of Asturias|PCA\u2013PCE]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{United Left of Asturias/meta/color}}|[[United Left of Asturias|IU\u2013IX]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Part\u00edu Asturianista/meta/color}}|[[Part\u00edu Asturianista|PAS]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Asturian Socialist Federation/meta/color}}|[[Asturian Socialist Federation|PSOE]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Union, Progress and Democracy/meta/color}}|[[Union, Progress and Democracy|UPyD]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|UCD]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Citizens (Spanish political party)/meta/color}}|[[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Cs]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Asturian Renewal Union/meta/color}}|[[Asturian Renewal Union|URAS]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Democratic and Social Centre (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[Democratic and Social Centre (Spain)|CDS]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Democratic Coalition (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[Democratic Coalition (Spain)|CD]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Asturias Forum/meta/color}}|[[Asturias Forum|FAC]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{People's Party of Asturias/meta/color}}|[[People's Party of Asturias|PP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{People's Coalition (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[People's Coalition (Spain)|CP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{People's Alliance (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[People's Alliance (Spain)|AP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Vox (political party)/meta/color}}|[[Vox (political party)|Vox]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{colend}}\n|}\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

[[Milk]] production and its derivatives was also traditional, but its big development was a byproduct of the economic expansion of the late 1960s. Nowadays, products from the dairy cooperative Central Lechera Asturiana are being commercialised all over Spain.\n\nThe main regional industry in modern times, however, was [[coal]] mining and [[steel]] production: in the times of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, it was the centre of Spain's steel industry. The then state-owned ENSIDESA steel company is now part of the privatised [[Aceralia]], now part of the [[ArcelorMittal]] Group. The industry created many jobs, which resulted in significant migration from other regions in Spain, mainly [[Extremadura]], [[Andalusia]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\nThe steel industry is now in decline when measured in terms of number of jobs provided, as is the mining. The reasons for the latter are mainly the high costs of production to extract the coal compared to other regions. Regional economic growth is below the broader Spanish rate, though in recent years growth in service industries has helped reduce Asturias's high rate of unemployment. Large out-of-town retail parks have opened near the region's largest cities (Gij\u00f3n and Oviedo), whilst the ever-present Spanish construction industry appears to continue to thrive.\n\nAsturias has benefited extensively since 1986 from [[European Union]] investment in roads and other essential [[infrastructure]], though there has also been some controversy regarding how these funds are spent, for example, on miners' pensions.\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the autonomous community was 23.3 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 24,400 euros or 81% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 98% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This makes the region the 10th richest in Spain, a big decrease from the 1970s/1980s - the heyday of the Spanish mining industry, when Asturias was commonly regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in Southern Europe.

On the plus side, unemployment in Asturias is below the average of Spain; it stood at 13.7% in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=de&pcode=tgs00010&plugin=1|title=Regional Unemployment by NUTS2 Region|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\"\n!Year\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n!Unemployment rate\n|9.2% \n|8.4% \n|8.5% \n|13.4%  \n|15.9%\n|17.8% \n|21.8% \n|24.1% \n|21.1%\n|19.1% \n|17.6% \n|13.7%\n|12.9%\n|}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:R\u00e9gional Embraer 190 F-HBLA OVD-LEAS.jpg|thumbnail|right|Asturias International Airport]]\n\n===Air===\nAsturias is served by [[Asturias Airport|Asturias International Airport (OVD)]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} from Oviedo, near the northwest coast and the industrial town of Avil\u00e9s.\n\n* Several national carriers link Asturias to [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], [[Alicante]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and others.\n** [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]]\n** [[Volotea]]\n** [[Vueling]]\n\nEastern Asturias is also easily accessible from [[Santander Airport]]. Recent improvements introduced in the road network permit flying into [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] and later driving into Asturias, which can be entered in less than an hour's drive. The Irish airline [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Santander Airport]] from Frankfurt Hahn, Liverpool, Dublin, Edinburgh, London Stansted and Rome Ciampino.\n\n===Sea===\n[[El Musel]] (the Port of Gij\u00f3n) is able to receive cruise ships of any size. Companies as P&O, Swan Hellenic or Hapag Lloyd choose the Port of Gij\u00f3n every year for their calls in the [[Atlantic Europe]]an Coast. The following areas are available for cruise vessels:\n* Moliner quay: 313 m berthing with 14 m draught.\n* 7\u00aa Alignment: 326 m with 12 m draught.\n* Espig\u00f3n II. South alignment. 360 m berth with 9 m draught.\n\nThese locations allow a high degree of access control, with security guaranteed for both vessels and passengers alike. The city centre is only {{cvt|4|km}} away and the Port Authority provides dedicated coach connection allowing passengers to take advantage of the cultural, [[gastronomy|gastronomic]] and commercial opportunities that Gij\u00f3n has to offer.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the city of Gij\u00f3n was connected by [[ferry]] with the French city of [[Nantes]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lne.es/gijon/2010/09/16/inaugurada-gijon-primera-autopista-mar-espanola/968763.html |title=Inaugurada en Gij\u00f3n la primera autopista del mar espa\u00f1ola |newspaper=[[La Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2015 |language=es |publisher=Prensa Ib\u00e9rica}}</ref> This connection was also known as the \"sea highway\" and it had a frequency of two ferries per day in both directions.

In modern architecture, the ''Palacio de Congresos de Oviedo'' (or ''Modoo'') was designed by [[Santiago Calatrava]].\n\n[[Gijon]], the biggest city of Asturias, is a coastal city known for cultural and sports events,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and a beach tourism centre in northern Spain. It also is known for the traditional Asturian gastronomy and for being an Asturian cider production spot.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Museums in the city include the '''[[Universidad Laboral de Gij\u00f3n]]''', including a modern art museum and theatre.\n\n[[Avil\u00e9s]] is the third largest city in Asturias, where \"La villa del adelantado\" (as locals call it, in reference of [[Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s]]) is a meeting point. \"Saint Nicholas of Bari\" or \"Capilla de los Alas\" in Romanesque and Romanesque-Gothic style, respectively; Palacio de Balsera, in Modernist style or St. Thomas of Canterbury church (dating from the 13th century) are examples which show the historical patrimony to be found in the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The [[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre|Centro Niemeyer]], designed by the Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], is an example of contemporary architecture in Asturias.\n\nThe [[Picos de Europa]] National Park, and other parts of the Asturian mountain range: The Picu Urriellu mountain (2519 m or 8262&nbsp;ft), also known as ''El Naranjo de Bulnes'', is a molar-shaped peak which, reputedly, glows orange in the evening sun, hence its name. Weather permitting, it can be viewed from Camarme\u00f1a village, near Poncebos, south of Arenas de Cabrales.\n\nThe shrine to the Virgin of [[Covadonga]] and the mountain lakes (''[[Lakes of Covadonga|Los Lagos]]''), near [[Cangas de On\u00eds]]: Legend has it that in the 8th century, the [[Our Lady of Covadonga|Virgin]] blessed Asturian Christian forces with a well-timed signal to attack Spain's Moorish conquerors, thereby taking the invaders by surprise in the [[Battle of Covadonga]]. The ''[[Reconquista]]'' and eventual unification of all Spain is therefore said to have started in this very location.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe paleolithic art in the caves of Asturias is declared [[World Heritage Site]] with the [[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain|Paleolithic Art of Northern Spain]].\n\nAsturias also has examples of [[Industrial archaeology|industrial heritage]] as a consequence of its industrial activities in the 19th and 20th centuries. It had metallurgical and chemical factories, mines, bridges and railways, including in the towns of [[Langreo]], [[Mieres]] and [[Avil\u00e9s]].\n\nThe Asturian coast: especially the beaches in and around the summer resort of [[Llanes]], the Playa del Silencio near [[Cudillero]] fishing village, or the \"white\" village of [[Luarca]] ([[Severo Ochoa]] hometown).\n\n===Other places of interest===\n[[File:Somiedo.jpg|thumb|Somiedo Lake]]\n* Ceceda village: east of [[Oviedo]] along the N634 road. Of particular interest in this exemplary settlement are the traditional ''[[H\u00f3rreo|horreos]]'' (grain silos), raised on stilts so as to keep field mice from getting at the grain.\n* The [[Dobra (Sella)|Dobra River]]: south of [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], known for its unusual colour.\n* The ''senda costera'' (coastal way) between Pendueles and [[Llanes]]: This partly paved nature route takes in some of Asturias' most spectacular coastal scenery, such as the noisy ''bufones'' ([[blowhole (geology)|blowholes]]) and the Playa de [[Ballota (Cudillero)|Ballota]].\n* [[Caldoveiro Peak]], a scenic mountain hiking area\n* The unusual rock formation on the beach at Buelna village: east of [[Llanes]]. Best viewed at low tide.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Architecture===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nAsturias has a rich artistic legacy that emphasizes [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] (''[[Asturias Arts]]'') indigenous architecture with monuments like [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco]], [[Santa Cristina de Lena]] and [[San Miguel de Lillo]]. These monuments have a Ramirense Romanesque style (due to [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]]) or [[San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados]], known as Santullano ([[Oviedo]]) of the Alfonsino pre-Romanesque style (due to [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]), which are all in Oviedo. Other examples of architecture are Villaviciosa's church, [[San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s]] (commonly known by the Asturians as \"Convent\u00edn\"), and the church of San Salvador de Priesca. Another example is [[Cabranes|Cabranes']] [[San Julian de Vi\u00f1\u00f3n]].\n\nThe [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style is very present, since all Asturias is crossed by one of the [[Camino de Santiago]] routes, which highlights the [[Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva]] (near [[Cangas de Onis]]), the churches of [[Church of San Esteban (Aramil)|San Esteban de Aramil]] ([[Siero]]), [[Church of San Juan (Amandi)|San Juan de Amandi]] ([[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]]) and Santa Mar\u00eda de Junco ([[Ribadesella]]).\n\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style is not as abundant, but there are good examples of this style, such as the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of San Salvador]] in Oviedo.\n\nThe [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style is more present by means of palace architecture, with such notable examples as the Palace of Camposagrado and Velarde - the latter seat of [[Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias]]. The Baroque style stands out in public civil engineering and bridge tolls ([[Olloniego]]); the milestones, the chairs or seats present along the road to Madrid and the resort of Caldas de Priorio (Oviedo) building.\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer92.jpg|thumb |[[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre]]]]\n\nIn 1985, the [[UNESCO]] declared the pre-Romanesque monuments and the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of Oviedo]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nIn popular architecture, the traditional granaries in Asturias, called ''[[h\u00f3rreo]]s'', are known for their demographic extension and their functional evolution, its basic characteristic being its mobility: it can be easily dismounted and transported to another location. The [[Panera]] is the evolution of the h\u00f3rreo, with examples exceeding {{convert|100|m2|0|abbr=off}} of area covered. The purpose of the horreo is to store objects and crops. With the arrival of maize and the beans, they were endowed with exterior corridors and railings for drying the harvests.\n\nAsturias is home to the only architectural work in Spain (as well as the largest in Europe) of the Brazilian architect and disciple of [[Le Corbusier]]; [[Oscar Niemeyer]]: the [[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre]]. The architectural project was donated to the Principality by the architect, who was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Award|Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts]], in the XXV edition of these awards. Niemeyer's project combined several different elements, and projected an open space, a place for education, culture and peace.\n\nIn the capital of the Principality stands one of the most representative buildings of modern architecture, the [[Palace of Congresses of Oviedo]], by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], who also awarded the Prince of Asturias of Award for the Arts in 1999.\n\nSpecial importance has been placed in recent years on the recovery of [[industrial heritage]] through various routes and industrial museums, especially in the central area of the region.\n\n===Festivals and holidays===\nSome of the most famous festivals in Asturias are from the small town of [[Llanes]]. These festivals celebrate the important saints and the Virgin Mary adored by the town. The associations that prepare the festivals have a rivalry between them and each year they try to outdo each other with more impressive shows. The three most important are the festival of San Roque (St. Roque) held on the 16th of August, the festival of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de La Guia (Our Lady, Virgin Mary, the Guide) held on the 8th of September, and the festival of Santa Maria Magdalena (St. Mary Magdalene) held on the 22nd of July. The Magdalena is well known for its impressive march of logs where boys as young as 3 and men carry logs through the town until they reach the end point and start a large bonfire.\n\n[[File:Traditional Asturian Dress.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Asturian dress being worn during a major festival in [[Llanes]]]]\n\n===Food and drink===\n{{main|Asturian cuisine}}\n[[File:Fabada y sidra.jpg|thumb|''Fabada asturiana'' and sidra (cider), a typical dish of Asturias]]\nWhile Asturias is especially known for its [[seafood]], the most famous regional dish is ''[[Fabada Asturiana|fabada asturiana]]'', a rich stew typically made with large white [[broad bean|beans]] (''fabes''), shoulder of [[pork]] (''lac\u00f3n''), black pudding (''[[morcilla]]''), and spicy [[sausage]] (''[[chorizo]]'').\n\n[[Apple]] groves foster the production of the region's traditional alcoholic drink, a natural [[cider]] (''sidra''). Since it is natural and bottled without gas, it produces a weak carbonation, and when Asturian cider is served, it is poured in a particular way, ''el escanciado'': the bottle is held above the head allowing for a long vertical pour, causing the cider to be aerated as it splashes into the glass below. After drinking most of the content, it is customary to splash a little out onto the ground, as a way to clean the glass of any [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] for the next serving. Traditionally, the same glass is refilled and passed around, with everyone drinking from it in turn.\n\nAsturian [[cheese]]s, especially [[Cabrales cheese|Cabrales]], are also eaten throughout Spain and beyond; Asturias is often called \"the land of cheeses\" (''el pa\u00eds de los quesos'').\n\n===Sport===\n{{Main|Sport in Asturias}}\nAsturias has two main football teams: [[Real Sporting de Gij\u00f3n|Sporting de Gij\u00f3n]] and [[Real Oviedo]], which have played over 35 seasons in [[La Liga]]. Other current notable sports teams are [[Oviedo CB]] (basketball) and [[AB Gij\u00f3n Jovellanos]] (handball).\n\nRacecar driver [[Fernando Alonso]] is a two-time [[Formula One]] world champion, and races with Asturias' flag colours on his helmet. Also, cyclist [[Samuel S\u00e1nchez]] won a gold at the Olympic games. Football players from Asturias include World Cup winner [[David Villa]] as well as [[Quini]], [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]], [[Juan Manuel Mata]], and [[Santiago Cazorla]], among others.\n\n===Literature===\n\nThese are some notable people of Asturian Literature:\n* [[Ant\u00f3n de Marirreguera]] (17th century)\n* [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] (1744\u20131811)\n* [[Ram\u00f3n de Campoamor]] (1817\u20131901)\n* [[Leopoldo Alas|Leopoldo Alas, \"Clar\u00edn\"]] (1851\u20131901)\n* [[Armando Palacio Vald\u00e9s]] (1853\u20131938)\n* [[Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala]] (1880\u20131962)\n* [[Alfonso Cam\u00edn]] (1890\u20131982)\n* [[Alejandro Casona]] (1903\u20131965)\n* [[Carlos Bouso\u00f1o]] (1923)\n* [[\u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez Mu\u00f1iz|\u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez]] (1925\u20132008)\n* [[Cor\u00edn Tellado]] (1927\u20132009)\n* [[Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez]] (1934)\n* [[Rafael Reig]] (1963)\n* [[Aurelio Gonz\u00e1lez Ovies]] (1964)\n* [[Xuan Bello]] (1965)\n* [[Jorge Moreno]] (1973)\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Al son de la gaita.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Gaita asturiana]]''.]]\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n de Valgrande-Pajares.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Valgrande-Pajares ski resort]]\n\nThe music of Asturias is varied.

It is coextensive with the [[provinces of Spain|province]] of Asturias and contains some of the territory that was part of the larger [[Kingdom of Asturias]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. Divided into eight [[Comarcas of Asturias|''comarcas'']] (counties), the autonomous community of Asturias is bordered by [[Cantabria]] to the east, by [[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] ([[Castile and Le\u00f3n]]) to the south, by [[Province of Lugo|Lugo]] ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]) to the west, and by the [[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Cantabrian Sea|Cantanbric sea]]) to the north.\n\nAsturias is situated in a mountainous setting with vast greenery and lush vegetation, making it part of [[Green Spain]]. The region has a [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]]. It receives plenty of annual rainfall and little sunshine by Spanish standards and has very moderated seasons, most often averaging in the lower 20's [[celsius]]. Heat waves are rare due to mountains blocking southerly winds. Winters are very mild for the latitude, especially near sea level.\n\nThe most important cities are the communal capital, [[Oviedo]] (''Uvi\u00e9u''), the seaport and largest city [[Gij\u00f3n]] (''Xix\u00f3n''), and the industrial town of [[Avil\u00e9s]]. Other [[List of municipalities in Asturias|municipalities in Asturias]] include [[Cangas de On\u00eds]] (''Cangues d'On\u00eds''), [[Cangas del Narcea]], [[Goz\u00f3n]], [[Grado, Asturias|Grado]] (''Grau'' or ''Grao''), [[Langreo]] (''Llangr\u00e9u''), [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]], [[Laviana]] (''Llaviana''), [[Lena, Asturias|Lena]] (''\u1e36\u1e37ena''), [[Llanes]], [[Mieres, Asturias|Mieres]], [[Siero]], [[Vald\u00e9s, Asturias|Vald\u00e9s]], [[Vegadeo]] (''A Veiga''), and [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]] (''see also [[List of municipalities in Asturias|List of municipalities]] and [[Comarcas of Asturias|comarcas in Asturias]]'').\n\nAsturias is also home of the [[Princess of Asturias Awards]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Termes romanes de Gij\u00f3n 03.JPG|upright|thumbnail|left|Roman thermae in Gij\u00f3n]]\n{{See also|Asturian architecture}}\n<!-- Note: parts of this section have been translated from the Spanish version of this page, at: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principado_de_Asturias -->\nAsturias was inhabited, first by ''[[Homo erectus]]'', then by [[Neanderthals]]. Since the [[Lower Paleolithic]] era, and during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], Asturias was characterized by cave paintings in the eastern part of the area. In the [[Mesolithic]] period, a native culture developed, that of the ''Asturiense'', and later, with the introduction of the [[Bronze Age]], [[megalith]]s and [[tumulus|tumuli]] were constructed. In the [[Iron Age]], the territory came under the cultural influence of the [[Celts]]; the local Celtic peoples, known as the [[Astur]]es, were composed of tribes such as the ''Luggones'', the ''Pesicos'', and others, who populated the entire area with ''[[castro (village)|castros]]'' (fortified hill-towns). Today the [[Astur]] Celtic influence persists in [[toponym|place names]], such as those of rivers and mountains.\n[[File:Iglesia de Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco.jpg|thumbnail|right|Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco, ancient palace of Asturian Kings, 842 AD. Many churches of Asturias are among the [[List of oldest church buildings#Europe|oldest churches of Europe since Early Middle Ages]].]]\nWith the conquest of Asturias by the [[Roman empire|Romans]] under [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] (29\u201319 BC), the region entered into recorded history. The Astures were subdued by the Romans but were never fully conquered. After several centuries without foreign presence, they enjoyed a brief revival during the Germanic invasions of the late 4th century AD, resisting [[Suebi|Suevi]] and [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] raids throughout the 5th Century AD, ending with the [[Moorish invasion of Spain]]. However, as it had been for the Romans and Visigoths, the Moors did not find mountainous territory easy to conquer, and the lands along Spain's northern coast never fully became part of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Rather, with the beginning of the Moorish conquest in the 8th century, this region became a refuge for Christian nobles, and in 722, a ''de facto'' independent kingdom was established, the ''[[Kingdom of Asturias|Regnum Asturorum]]'', which was to become the cradle of the incipient ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest).\n\nIn the 10th century, the Kingdom of Asturias gave way to the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], and during the [[Middle Ages]] the geographic isolation of the territory made historical references scarce. Through the rebellion of [[Henry II of Castile]] in the 14th century, the Principality of Asturias was established. The most famous proponents of independence were Gonzalo Pel\u00e1ez and [[Queen Urraca]], who, while achieving significant victories, were ultimately defeated by [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] troops. After its integration into the [[Kingdom of Spain]], Asturias provided the Spanish court with high-ranking aristocrats and played an important role in the colonisation of America. Since 1388, the heir to the Castilian (later Spanish) throne has been styled [[Prince of Asturias]]. In the 16th century, the population reached 100,000 for the first time, and within another century that number would double due to the arrival of American [[maize|corn]].\n\n[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]]]]\nIn the 18th century, Asturias was one of the centres of the [[Enlightenment Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]]. The renowned [[Galician people|Galician]] thinker [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro|Benito de Feij\u00f3o]] settled in the [[Benedictine]] [[Monastery]] of [[San Vicente de Oviedo]]. [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]], a [[polymath]] and prominent reformer and politician of the late 18th century, was born in the seaside town of [[Gij\u00f3n]].\n\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Asturias was the first Spanish province to rise up against the French following the abdication of King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] on 10 May 1808. Riots began in Oviedo and on 25 May the local government formally declared war on [[Napoleon]] with 18,000 men called to arms to resist invasion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oman |first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Oman|year=1902 |title=A History of the Peninsular War |volume=1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.278497/2015.278497.A-History#page/n89/mode/2up|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=65}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] came to Asturias after 1830 with the discovery and systematic exploitation of coal mines and iron factories at the mining basins of [[Nal\u00f3n (comarca)|Nal\u00f3n]] and [[Caudal (Asturian comarca)|Caudal]]. At the same time, there was significant migration to [[Americas|the Americas]] (especially [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]] and [[Mexico]]); those who succeeded overseas often returned to their native land much wealthier. These entrepreneurs were known collectively as 'Indianos', for having visited and made their fortunes in the [[West Indies]] and beyond. The heritage of these wealthy families can still be seen in Asturias today: many large 'modernista' villas are dotted across the region, as well as cultural institutions such as free schools and public libraries.\n\n[[File:NE 800ad.jpg|thumb|Location of Asturias and its neighbors in 800 AD]]\nAsturias played an important part in the events that led up to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In October 1934 Asturian miners and other workers staged an armed uprising  (see [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|Revolution of Asturias]]) to oppose the coming to power of the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right|right-wing CEDA]] party, which had obtained three ministerial posts in the centralist government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. For a month, a Popular Front Committee exercised control in southern Asturias, while local workers committees sprang up elsewhere in the region. A war committee dominated by [[anarcho-syndicalist]] supporters took power in Oviedo . Troops under the command of a then unknown general named [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco Bahamonde]] were brought from [[Spanish Morocco]] to suppress the revolt. Franco applied tactics normally reserved for overseas colonies, using troops of the [[Spanish Legion]] and [[Regulares|Moroccan troops]]: ferocious oppression followed.\n\nAs a result, Asturias remained loyal to the republican government during the [[Spanish Civil War]], and was the scene of an extraordinary defence in extreme terrain, the [[Battle of El Mazuco]]. With Franco eventually gaining control of all Spain, Asturias \u2014 traditionally linked to the [[Spanish Crown]] \u2014 was known merely as the \"Province of Oviedo\" from 1939 until Franco's death in 1975. The province's name was restored fully after the return of democracy to Spain, in 1977. In the 50s and 60s the industrial progress of Asturias continued with the constitution of national enterprises like [[Ensidesa]] and Hunosa, but the 80s was the decade of a dramatic [[industrial restructuring]].\n\nOn 30 December 1981,<ref name=lavozdeasturias>{{cite news|title=Fallece Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez |url=http://www.redasturias.com/asturias/Fallece-Rafael-Fernandez_0_392960711.html |work=[[La Voz de Asturias]] |date=2010-12-18 |accessdate=2011-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715164353/http://www.redasturias.com/asturias/Fallece-Rafael-Fernandez_0_392960711.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref> Asturias became an autonomous community within the decentralised territorial structure established by the Constitution of 1978. [[Rafael Luis Fern\u00e1ndez \u00c1lvarez]], who had previously served as the President of the Regional Council since 1978, became the first [[President of the Principality of Asturias]], upon the adoption of autonomy.<ref name=lavozdeasturias/> The [[Government of the Principality of Asturias|Asturian regional government]] holds comprehensive competencies in important areas such as health, education and protection of the environment. As of May 2011, the President of the Government of Asturias was [[Francisco \u00c1lvarez-Cascos]], of the [[Foro Asturias]] (FAC), followed by [[Javier Fern\u00e1ndez Fern\u00e1ndez|Javier Fern\u00e1ndez]] ([[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]]) in 2012 and the current president is [[Adri\u00e1n Barb\u00f3n]] ([[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]]) elected in 2019.\n\n==Administrative and territorial division==\nAsturias is organised territorially into 78 [[Municipality|municipalities]], further subdivided into [[Parroquia (Spain)|parishes]].\n\n===Municipalities of Asturias===\n{{See also|Municipalities of Asturias}}\n{{Largest cities of Asturias}}\n\n===Parishes===\n{{Main|Parroquia (Spain)}}\n\nThe parroquia or parish is the subdivision of the Asturian municipalities. Currently, there are 857 parishes integrating the 78 municipalities in the region, and they usually coincide with the ecclesiastic divisions.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Picos Europa.jpg|left|thumb|Picos de Europa]]\nThe [[Cantabrian Mountains]] (''Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica'') form Asturias's natural border with the province of [[Le\u00f3n (province)|Le\u00f3n]] to the south. In the eastern range, the [[Picos de Europa]] National Park contains the highest and arguably most spectacular mountains, rising to {{Convert|2648|m|ft}} at the Torrecerredo peak. Other notable features of this predominantly limestone range are the [[Redes Natural Park|Parque Natural de Redes]] in the central east, the central Ubi\u00f1as south of [[Oviedo]], and the [[Somiedo Natural Park|Parque Natural de Somiedo]] in the west. The Cantabrian mountains offer opportunities for activities such as climbing, walking, skiing and caving, and extend some {{Convert|200|km|mi}} in total, as far as [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] province to the west of Asturias and [[Cantabria]] province to the east. Similar opportunities are available for the traveler of Asturias interested in [[Caldoveiro Peak]].\n\nThe Asturian coastline is extensive, with hundreds of beaches, coves and natural sea caves. Notable examples include the Playa del Silencio (''Beach of Silence'') near the fishing village of Cudillero (west of [[Gij\u00f3n]]), as well as the many beaches surrounding the summer resort of Llanes, such as the Barro, Ballota and Torimbia (the latter a predominantly [[nudist]] beach). Most of Asturias's beaches are sandy, clean, and bordered by steep cliffs, on top of which it is not unusual to see grazing livestock.\n\n[[File:Playa de Torimbia.jpg|thumb|Torimbia beach, [[Llanes]] ]]\nThe key features of Asturian geography are its rugged coastal cliffs and the mountainous interior.\nThe climate of Asturias is heavily marked by the gulf stream. Falling within the Cantabrian belt known as Green Spain it has high precipitations all year round. Summers are mild and, on the coast, winters also have relatively benign temperatures, rarely including frost. The cold is especially felt in the mountains, where snow is present from October till May. Both rain and snow are regular weather features of Asturian winters. In coastal or near-coastal areas, daytime high temperatures generally average around {{convert|12|C|F}} \u2013 {{convert|13|C|F}} during winter and {{convert|22|C|F}} \u2013 {{convert|23|C|F}} in summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/en/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=1249I&k=ast |title=Standard climate values for Oviedo |work=[[Agencia Estatal de

These factories have been a major cause of the area's high airborne pollution.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|INE]]\n|1900 | 627000\n|1910 | 685000\n|1920 | 744000\n|1930 | 792000\n|1940 | 837000\n|1950 | 888000\n|1960 | 989000\n|1970 | 1046000\n|1981 | 1129572\n|1991 | 1093937\n|2001 | 1062998\n|2011 | 1075813\n|2012 | 1077360\n|2013 | 1068165\n|2014 | 1061756\n|2015 | 1051229\n|2016 | 1042608\n|2017 | 1034960\n|2018 | 1028244\n|2019 | 1022800\n}}\n\nIn 2017, Asturias had a [[total fertility rate]] of 1.03, the lowest in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tgs00100 |title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date=2015-03-02 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}</ref>\n\n===Languages===\n[[File:Asturian linguistic areas.PNG|thumb|left|Language map of Asturias]]\nThe only official language in Asturias is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[Asturian language]], also known as Bable, is also spoken, and is protected by law (''Ley 1/1998, de 23 de marzo, de uso y promoci\u00f3n del bable/asturiano'' \u2014 \"Law 1/1998, of 23 March, of Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian\"). It is sometimes used by the Asturian [[civil service]]. In the western part of Asturias, [[Eonavian]] is also spoken, and its promotion also falls under the responsibility of Law 1/1998. Whether Eonavian is a [[dialect continuum]] or a variety of [[Galician language]], however, is a subject of debate, and its use in the Asturian Administration is minor compared to the use of the Asturian language. Within Asturias, there is an ongoing process to establish [[place names]] in Asturian and Eonavian dialects.\n\n==Politics==\nThe organisation and political structure of Asturias is governed by the [[Statute of Autonomy of the Principality of Asturias]], in force since 30 January 1982. According to the Statute, the institutional bodies of the Principality of Asturias are three: the [[Council of Government of the Principality of Asturias|Council of Government]], the [[General Junta of the Principality of Asturias|General Junta]] and [[President of the Principality of Asturias|President]]. The form of government of the Principality is [[Parliamentarism|Parliament]]: The General Junta is the [[legislature]] to choose, on behalf of the Asturian people, the President of the Principality of Asturias. The President is also the one of the Council of Government, the head of [[executive power]], and politically answerable to the General Junta.\n\nThe functions of the General Junta are the approval of budgets, and the direction and control of the action of the Council of Government. It is composed of 45 deputies, elected for four years through theuniversal suffrage within a system proportional representation that the allocation of deputies is based on D'Hondt method.\n\n===Results of the elections to the General Junta===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! colspan=\"3\" |Deputies in General Junta since 1983\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; width:100%; float:left; border:0; margin-top:-1px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#FDFDFD;\"| ''Key to parties''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:95%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:8px; background:white;\"|\n{{colbegin|colwidth=12.5em}}\n{{legend|{{Podemos Asturias/meta/color}}|[[Podemos_(Spanish_political_party)|Podemos]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Communist Party of Asturias/meta/color}}|[[Communist Party of Asturias|PCA\u2013PCE]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{United Left of Asturias/meta/color}}|[[United Left of Asturias|IU\u2013IX]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Part\u00edu Asturianista/meta/color}}|[[Part\u00edu Asturianista|PAS]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Asturian Socialist Federation/meta/color}}|[[Asturian Socialist Federation|PSOE]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Union, Progress and Democracy/meta/color}}|[[Union, Progress and Democracy|UPyD]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|UCD]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Citizens (Spanish political party)/meta/color}}|[[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Cs]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Asturian Renewal Union/meta/color}}|[[Asturian Renewal Union|URAS]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Democratic and Social Centre (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[Democratic and Social Centre (Spain)|CDS]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Democratic Coalition (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[Democratic Coalition (Spain)|CD]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Asturias Forum/meta/color}}|[[Asturias Forum|FAC]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{People's Party of Asturias/meta/color}}|[[People's Party of Asturias|PP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{People's Coalition (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[People's Coalition (Spain)|CP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{People's Alliance (Spain)/meta/color}}|[[People's Alliance (Spain)|AP]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend|{{Vox (political party)/meta/color}}|[[Vox (political party)|Vox]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{colend}}\n|}\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

[[Milk]] production and its derivatives was also traditional, but its big development was a byproduct of the economic expansion of the late 1960s. Nowadays, products from the dairy cooperative Central Lechera Asturiana are being commercialised all over Spain.\n\nThe main regional industry in modern times, however, was [[coal]] mining and [[steel]] production: in the times of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, it was the centre of Spain's steel industry. The then state-owned ENSIDESA steel company is now part of the privatised [[Aceralia]], now part of the [[ArcelorMittal]] Group. The industry created many jobs, which resulted in significant migration from other regions in Spain, mainly [[Extremadura]], [[Andalusia]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\nThe steel industry is now in decline when measured in terms of number of jobs provided, as is the mining. The reasons for the latter are mainly the high costs of production to extract the coal compared to other regions. Regional economic growth is below the broader Spanish rate, though in recent years growth in service industries has helped reduce Asturias's high rate of unemployment. Large out-of-town retail parks have opened near the region's largest cities (Gij\u00f3n and Oviedo), whilst the ever-present Spanish construction industry appears to continue to thrive.\n\nAsturias has benefited extensively since 1986 from [[European Union]] investment in roads and other essential [[infrastructure]], though there has also been some controversy regarding how these funds are spent, for example, on miners' pensions.\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the autonomous community was 23.3 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 24,400 euros or 81% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 98% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This makes the region the 10th richest in Spain, a big decrease from the 1970s/1980s - the heyday of the Spanish mining industry, when Asturias was commonly regarded as one of the most prosperous regions in Southern Europe.

Best viewed at low tide.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Architecture===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nAsturias has a rich artistic legacy that emphasizes [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] (''[[Asturias Arts]]'') indigenous architecture with monuments like [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco]], [[Santa Cristina de Lena]] and [[San Miguel de Lillo]]. These monuments have a Ramirense Romanesque style (due to [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]]) or [[San Juli\u00e1n de los Prados]], known as Santullano ([[Oviedo]]) of the Alfonsino pre-Romanesque style (due to [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]), which are all in Oviedo. Other examples of architecture are Villaviciosa's church, [[San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s]] (commonly known by the Asturians as \"Convent\u00edn\"), and the church of San Salvador de Priesca. Another example is [[Cabranes|Cabranes']] [[San Julian de Vi\u00f1\u00f3n]].\n\nThe [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style is very present, since all Asturias is crossed by one of the [[Camino de Santiago]] routes, which highlights the [[Monastery of San Pedro de Villanueva]] (near [[Cangas de Onis]]), the churches of [[Church of San Esteban (Aramil)|San Esteban de Aramil]] ([[Siero]]), [[Church of San Juan (Amandi)|San Juan de Amandi]] ([[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]]) and Santa Mar\u00eda de Junco ([[Ribadesella]]).\n\nThe [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style is not as abundant, but there are good examples of this style, such as the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of San Salvador]] in Oviedo.\n\nThe [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style is more present by means of palace architecture, with such notable examples as the Palace of Camposagrado and Velarde - the latter seat of [[Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias]]. The Baroque style stands out in public civil engineering and bridge tolls ([[Olloniego]]); the milestones, the chairs or seats present along the road to Madrid and the resort of Caldas de Priorio (Oviedo) building.\n[[File:CentroNiemeyer92.jpg|thumb |[[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre]]]]\n\nIn 1985, the [[UNESCO]] declared the pre-Romanesque monuments and the [[Oviedo Cathedral|Cathedral of Oviedo]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nIn popular architecture, the traditional granaries in Asturias, called ''[[h\u00f3rreo]]s'', are known for their demographic extension and their functional evolution, its basic characteristic being its mobility: it can be easily dismounted and transported to another location. The [[Panera]] is the evolution of the h\u00f3rreo, with examples exceeding {{convert|100|m2|0|abbr=off}} of area covered. The purpose of the horreo is to store objects and crops. With the arrival of maize and the beans, they were endowed with exterior corridors and railings for drying the harvests.\n\nAsturias is home to the only architectural work in Spain (as well as the largest in Europe) of the Brazilian architect and disciple of [[Le Corbusier]]; [[Oscar Niemeyer]]: the [[Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre]]. The architectural project was donated to the Principality by the architect, who was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Award|Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts]], in the XXV edition of these awards. Niemeyer's project combined several different elements, and projected an open space, a place for education, culture and peace.\n\nIn the capital of the Principality stands one of the most representative buildings of modern architecture, the [[Palace of Congresses of Oviedo]], by the Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], who also awarded the Prince of Asturias of Award for the Arts in 1999.\n\nSpecial importance has been placed in recent years on the recovery of [[industrial heritage]] through various routes and industrial museums, especially in the central area of the region.\n\n===Festivals and holidays===\nSome of the most famous festivals in Asturias are from the small town of [[Llanes]]. These festivals celebrate the important saints and the Virgin Mary adored by the town. The associations that prepare the festivals have a rivalry between them and each year they try to outdo each other with more impressive shows. The three most important are the festival of San Roque (St. Roque) held on the 16th of August, the festival of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de La Guia (Our Lady, Virgin Mary, the Guide) held on the 8th of September, and the festival of Santa Maria Magdalena (St. Mary Magdalene) held on the 22nd of July. The Magdalena is well known for its impressive march of logs where boys as young as 3 and men carry logs through the town until they reach the end point and start a large bonfire.\n\n[[File:Traditional Asturian Dress.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Asturian dress being worn during a major festival in [[Llanes]]]]\n\n===Food and drink===\n{{main|Asturian cuisine}}\n[[File:Fabada y sidra.jpg|thumb|''Fabada asturiana'' and sidra (cider), a typical dish of Asturias]]\nWhile Asturias is especially known for its [[seafood]], the most famous regional dish is ''[[Fabada Asturiana|fabada asturiana]]'', a rich stew typically made with large white [[broad bean|beans]] (''fabes''), shoulder of [[pork]] (''lac\u00f3n''), black pudding (''[[morcilla]]''), and spicy [[sausage]] (''[[chorizo]]'').\n\n[[Apple]] groves foster the production of the region's traditional alcoholic drink, a natural [[cider]] (''sidra''). Since it is natural and bottled without gas, it produces a weak carbonation, and when Asturian cider is served, it is poured in a particular way, ''el escanciado'': the bottle is held above the head allowing for a long vertical pour, causing the cider to be aerated as it splashes into the glass below. After drinking most of the content, it is customary to splash a little out onto the ground, as a way to clean the glass of any [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] for the next serving. Traditionally, the same glass is refilled and passed around, with everyone drinking from it in turn.\n\nAsturian [[cheese]]s, especially [[Cabrales cheese|Cabrales]], are also eaten throughout Spain and beyond; Asturias is often called \"the land of cheeses\" (''el pa\u00eds de los quesos'').\n\n===Sport===\n{{Main|Sport in Asturias}}\nAsturias has two main football teams: [[Real Sporting de Gij\u00f3n|Sporting de Gij\u00f3n]] and [[Real Oviedo]], which have played over 35 seasons in [[La Liga]]. Other current notable sports teams are [[Oviedo CB]] (basketball) and [[AB Gij\u00f3n Jovellanos]] (handball).\n\nRacecar driver [[Fernando Alonso]] is a two-time [[Formula One]] world champion, and races with Asturias' flag colours on his helmet. Also, cyclist [[Samuel S\u00e1nchez]] won a gold at the Olympic games. Football players from Asturias include World Cup winner [[David Villa]] as well as [[Quini]], [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]], [[Juan Manuel Mata]], and [[Santiago Cazorla]], among others.\n\n===Literature===\n\nThese are some notable people of Asturian Literature:\n* [[Ant\u00f3n de Marirreguera]] (17th century)\n* [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] (1744\u20131811)\n* [[Ram\u00f3n de Campoamor]] (1817\u20131901)\n* [[Leopoldo Alas|Leopoldo Alas, \"Clar\u00edn\"]] (1851\u20131901)\n* [[Armando Palacio Vald\u00e9s]] (1853\u20131938)\n* [[Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala]] (1880\u20131962)\n* [[Alfonso Cam\u00edn]] (1890\u20131982)\n* [[Alejandro Casona]] (1903\u20131965)\n* [[Carlos Bouso\u00f1o]] (1923)\n* [[\u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez Mu\u00f1iz|\u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez]] (1925\u20132008)\n* [[Cor\u00edn Tellado]] (1927\u20132009)\n* [[Gonzalo Su\u00e1rez]] (1934)\n* [[Rafael Reig]] (1963)\n* [[Aurelio Gonz\u00e1lez Ovies]] (1964)\n* [[Xuan Bello]] (1965)\n* [[Jorge Moreno]] (1973)\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Al son de la gaita.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Gaita asturiana]]''.]]\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n de Valgrande-Pajares.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Valgrande-Pajares ski resort]]\n\nThe music of Asturias is varied.

Thus [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] (757\u201368) killed 40,000 Muslims but also defeated the Basques and [[Galicians]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Medieval Frontiers: Concepts and Practices |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> and [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]] (774\u201383) made peace with the Muslims but not with the Galicians. Under King [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] (791\u2013842), the kingdom was firmly established with Alfonso's recognition as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Pope]]. He conquered [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and the Basques. During his reign, the holy bones of St [[James the Great]] were declared to be found in Galicia, in Compostela (from Latin ''campus stellae'', literally \"the field of the star\"). Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a way of communication between the isolated Asturias and the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] lands and beyond. Alfonso's policy consisted in depopulating the borders of [[Bardulia]] (which would turn into Castile) in order to gain population support north of the mountains. With this growth came a corresponding increase in military forces. The kingdom was now strong enough to sack the [[Moors|Moorish]] cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] and [[Coimbra]]. However, for centuries to come the focus of these actions was not conquest but pillage and tribute. In the summers of 792, 793 and 794 several Muslim attacks plundered Alava, and the heart of the Asturian kingdom, reaching up to the capital, Oviedo. In one of the retreats, Alfonso inflicted a [[Battle of Lutos|severe defeat]] on the Muslims in the swampy area of Lutos, killing 70,000.<ref>Roger Collins, ''Caliphs and Kings: Spain, 796-1031'', 65.</ref>\n\nWhen Alfonso II died, [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842\u201350) staged a coup against the ''Count of the Palace'' [[Nepotian of Asturias|Nepotian]], who had taken the throne. After a battle on a bridge over the river Narcea, Nepotian was captured in flight, blinded and then forced into monastic life. Early in his reign, Ramiro was faced with a [[Viking raid on Galicia and Asturias|Viking attack]] at a place called ''Farum Brecantium'', believed to be present-day [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]].

Gil, Cr\u00f3nicas Asturianas, 1985, p. 176</ref> The considerable territorial expansion of the Asturian kingdom under [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] (866\u2013910) was largely made possible by the collapse of Umayyad control over many parts of [[Al-Andalus]] at this time. Between the years 866 and 881, the western frontier of the kingdom in Galicia was expanded into the northern part of modern-day [[Portugal]]. The year 878 saw a Muslim assault on the towns of Astorga and Le\u00f3n. The expedition consisted of two detachments, one of which was decisively defeated at [[Battle of Polvoraria|Polvoraria]] on the river Orbigo, with an alleged loss of 13,000 men. In 881, Alfonso took the offensive, leading an army deep into the Lower March, crossing the Tagus River to approach Merida. Then miles from the city the Asturian army crossed the Guadiana River and defeated the Umayyad army on \"Monte Oxifer\", allegedly leaving 15,000 Muslim soldiers killed. Returning home, Alfonso devoted himself to building the churches of Oviedo and constructing one or more two palaces for himself.\n\nThe Kingdom of Asturias transitioned into the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] in 924, when [[Fruela II of Asturias]] became king with his royal court in Le\u00f3n.<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1983 | title = Early Medieval Spain | publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York|isbn= 0-312-22464-8|page = 238}}</ref>\n\n== Indigenous background ==\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 910-es.svg|thumb|left|Kingdom of Asturias, circa 910&nbsp;AD]]\nThe kingdom originated in the western and central territory of the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], particularly the [[Picos de Europa]] and the central area of Asturias. The main political and military events during the first decades of the kingdom's existence took place in the region. According to the descriptions of [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and other Graeco-Roman geographers, several peoples of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited the lands of Asturias at the beginning of the Christian era, most notably:\n\n*in the [[Cantabri]], the ''Vadinienses'', who inhabited the Picos de Europa region and whose settlement gradually expanded southward during the first centuries of the modern era\n*the ''Orgenomesci'', who dwelled along the Asturian eastern coast\n*in the [[Astures]], the ''Saelini'', whose settlement extended through the [[Sella River (Bay of Biscay)|Sella Valley]]\n*the ''Luggones'', who had their capital in ''Lucus Asturum'' and whose territories stretched between the Sella and Nal\u00f3n\n*the ''Astures'' (in the strictest sense), who dwelled in inner Asturias, between the current councils of [[Pilo\u00f1a]] and [[Cangas del Narcea]]\n*the ''Paesici'', who had settled along the coast of Western Asturias, between the mouth of the Navia river and the modern city of [[Gij\u00f3n]]\n\n[[File:Somiedo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Picture of ''\u1e37\u1e37agu del Va\u1e37\u1e37e'' ([[Somiedo]]), showing typical Asturian cottages (called ''teitos''), as already in use in the time of the [[Astures]]]]\n\nClassical geographers give conflicting views of the ethnic description of the above-mentioned peoples. [[Ptolemy]] says that the Astures extended along the central area of current Asturias, between the Navia and Sella rivers, fixing the latter river as the boundary with the Cantabrian territory. However, other geographers placed the frontier between the Astures and the Cantabri further to the east: [[Julius Honorius]] stated in his ''Cosmographia'' that the springs of the river [[Ebro]] were located in the land of the Astures (''sub asturibus''). In any case, ethnic borders in the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] were not so important after that time, as the clan divisions that permeated the pre-Roman societies of all the peoples of Northern Iberia faded under similar political administrative culture imposed on them by the Romans.\n\nThe situation started to change during the Late [[Roman Empire]] and the early [[Middle Ages]], when an Asturian identity gradually started to develop: the centuries-old fight between [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] and [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebian nobles]] may have helped to forge a distinct identity among the peoples of the Cantabrian districts. Several archaeological digs in the ''[[Castros (Spain)|castro]]'' of La Carisa (municipality of Lena) have found remnants of a defensive line whose main purpose was to protect the valleys of central Asturias from invaders who came from [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|the Meseta]] through the Pajares pass: the construction of these fortifications reveals a high degree of organization and cooperation among the several Asturian communities, in order to defend themselves from the southern invaders. [[Carbon-14]] tests have found that the wall dates from the period 675\u2013725&nbsp;AD, when two armed expeditions against the Asturians took place: one of them headed by Visigothic king [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] (reigned 672\u2013680); the other by Muslim governor [[Musa bin Nusayr]] during the Umayyad conquest, who settled garrisons over its territory.\n\nThe gradual formation of Asturian identity led to the creation of the Kingdom of Asturias after Pelagius' coronation and the victory over the Muslim garrisons in [[Battle of Covadonga|Covadonga]] in the early 8th century. The ''Chronica Albeldense'', in narrating the happenings of Covadonga, stated that \"Divine providence brings forth the King of Asturias\".\n\n== Umayyad occupation and Asturian revolt ==\n[[File:Estatua de Don Pelayo en Covadonga, Asturias.jpg|thumb|left|Monument in memory of Pelagius in [[Covadonga]]]]\nThe kingdom was established by the nobleman Pelayo ({{lang-la|Pelagius}}), possibly an Asturian noble. No substantial movement of refugees from central Iberia could have taken place before the [[Battle of Covadonga]], and in 714 Asturias was overrun by Musa bin Nusayr with no effective or known opposition.<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1983 | title = Early Medieval Spain | publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York|isbn= 0-312-22464-8|page = 229}}</ref> It has also been claimed that he may have retired to the Asturian mountains after the [[Battle of Guadalete]], where in the Gothic tradition of [[Teia|Theias]] he was elected by the other nobles as leader of the [[Astures]]. Pelayo's kingdom was initially little more than a rallying banner for existing guerilla forces.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA88 |title=Encyclopedia of African American History - Google B\u0159ker |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EAgAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA294 |title=Encyclop\u0107dia metropolitana; or, Universal dictionary of knowledge ... - Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Google B\u0159ker |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the progress of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the main cities and administrative centers fell into the hands of Muslim troops. Control of the central and southern regions, such as the [[Guadalquivir]] and Ebro valleys, presented few problems for the newcomers, who used the existing Visigothic administrative structures, ultimately of Roman origin. However, in the northern mountains, urban centers (such as [[Gij\u00f3n|Gigia]]) were practically nonexistent and the submission of the country had to be achieved valley by valley. Muslim troops often resorted to the taking of hostages to ensure the pacification of the newly conquered territory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAfter the first incursion of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad|Tarik]], who reached Toledo in 711, the Yemeni viceroy of [[Ifriqiya]], [[Musa bin Nusayr]], crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] the following year and carried out a massive operation of conquest that would lead to the capture of M\u00e9rida, Toledo, Zaragoza and Lerida, among other cities. During the last phase of his military campaign, he reached the northwest of the Peninsula, where he gained control of the localities of [[Lugo]] and [[Gij\u00f3n]]. In the latter city, he placed a small Berber detachment under a governor, [[Munuza]], whose mission was to consolidate Muslim control over Asturias. As a guarantee of the submission of the region, some nobles \u2013 some argue that Pelayo was among them \u2013 had to surrender hostages from Asturias to Cordoba. The legend says that his sister was asked for, and a marriage alliance sought with the local Berber leader. Later on, Munuza would try to do the same at another mountain post in the Pyrenees, where he rebelled against his Cordoban Arab superiors. The [[Berbers]] had been converted to Islam barely a generation earlier, and were considered second rank to Arabs and Syrians. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe most commonly accepted hypothesis for the battle (epic as described by later Christian Asturian sources, but a mere skirmish in Muslim texts) is that the Moorish column was attacked from the cliffs and then fell back through the valleys towards present day Gij\u00f3n, but it was attacked in retreat by the retinue and nearly destroyed. However, the only near-contemporary account of the events of the time, the Christian [[Chronicle of 754]], makes no mention of the incident.\n\nHowever, as is told in the ''Rotensian Chronicle'' <ref>This is the chronicle of [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] in which Pelayo is considered the successor of the kings of Toledo, with the clear goal of establishing Alfonso's political legitimacy.</ref> as well as in that of [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari]],<ref>A Maghrebi historian of the 16th century who died in Cairo, Egypt, and who could have used the ''Rotensian Chronicle'' and rewritten it eight centuries later, making it useless as a historical document.</ref> Pelayo escaped from Cordoba during the governorship of [[Al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi|al-Hurr]] (717\u2013718) and his return to Asturias triggered a revolt against the Muslim authorities of Gij\u00f3n. The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that is only one of the theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, lived at that time in Bres, in the district of [[Pilo\u00f1a]], and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the [[Pilo\u00f1a (river)|Pilo\u00f1a]] and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Mt. Auseva, taking refuge in one of its caves, [[Covadonga]]. After an attempted siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, the troops are said to have exited through the high ports to the south, in order to continue their search-and-destroy mission against other rebels. There, the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was annihilated. The rest of its survivors continued south to the plains of [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Leon]], leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed.\n\nThe victory, relatively small, as only a few Berber soldiers were involved, resulted in great prestige for Pelayo and provoked a massive insurrection by other nobles in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]] who immediately rallied around him, electing him King or military [[Dux]].\n\nUnder Pelayo's leadership, the attacks on the [[Berbers]] increased. Munuza, feeling isolated in a region increasingly hostile, decided to abandon Gij\u00f3n and headed for the Plateau (''Meseta'') through the Mesa Trail.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, he was intercepted and killed by Astures at Olal\u00edes (in the current district of [[Grado, Asturias|Grado]]). Once he had expelled the Moors from the eastern valleys of Asturias, Pelayo attacked [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]], the main city in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and secured the mountain passes, insulating the region from Moorish attack.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Pelayo continued attacking those Berbers who remained north of the Asturian Mountains until they withdrew, but the latter mostly deserted their garrisons in response to the wider rebellion against Arab control from Cordoba. He then married his daughter, Ermesinda, to Alfonso, the son of Peter of Cantabria, the leading noble at the still-independent Visigothic duchy of [[Cantabria]]. His son Favila was married to Froiliuba.\n\nRecent archaeological excavations have found fortifications in Mount Homon and La Carisa (near the Huerna and Pajares valleys) dated between the end of the seventh and beginning of the eighth centuries. The Berber fortifications included watchtowers and moats of almost two meters, in whose construction and defense many hundreds may have participated. That would have required a high degree of organization and firm leadership, probably by Pelayo himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pNumEjemplar=1295&pIdSeccion=38&pIdNoticia=412025|title=La Nueva Espaa - Diario Independiente de Asturias|author=La Nueva Espaa|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Therefore, experts consider it probable that the construction of the defensive line was intended to prevent the reentry of Moors into Asturias through the mountain passes of Mesa and Pajares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pNumEjemplar=1336&pIdSeccion=39&pIdNoticia=424603|title=La Nueva Espaa - Diario Independiente de Asturias|author=La Nueva Espaa|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pelayo en la batalla de Covadonga BNE Mss 2805 f 23r (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|King Pelagius at the Battle of Covadonga]]\nAfter Pelayo's victory over the Moorish detachment at the [[Battle of Covadonga]], a small territorial independent entity was established in the Asturian mountains that was the origin of the kingdom of Asturias. Pelayo's leadership was not comparable to that of the Visigothic kings. The first kings of Asturias referred to themselves as \"princeps\" (prince) and later as \"rex\" (king), but the later title was not firmly established until the period of Alphonse II. The title of \"''[[princeps]]''\" had been used by the indigenous peoples of Northern Spain and its use appears in Galician and Cantabrian inscriptions, in which expressions like \"N\u00edcer, Pr\u00edncipe de los Albiones\"<ref>The Asturian writer Juan Noriega made him one of the main characters of ''[[La Noche Celta]]'' (''The Celtic Night''), set in the castle of Coa\u00f1a.</ref> (on an inscription found in the district of Coa\u00f1a) and \"''princeps cantabrorum''\"<ref>''Doviderio, Pr\u00edncipe de los C\u00e1ntabros''.</ref> (over a gravestone of the municipality of Cistierna, in Leon). In fact, the Kingdom of Asturias originated as a focus of leadership over other peoples of the Cantabrian Coast that had resisted the Romans as well as the Visigoths and that were not willing to subject themselves to the dictates of the Umayyad Caliphate. Immigrants from the south, fleeing from Al-Andalus, brought a Gothic influence to the Asturian kingdom. However, at the beginning of the 9th century, Alphonse II's will cursed the Visigoths, blaming them for the loss of Hispania. The later chronicles on which knowledge of the period is based, all written during the reign of Alphonse III, when there was great Gothic ideological influence, are the Sebastianensian Chronicle (''Cr\u00f3nica Sebastianense''), the Albeldensian Chronicle (''Cr\u00f3nica Albeldense'') and the Rotensian Chronicle (''Cr\u00f3nica Rotense'').\n\nDuring the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax and so it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelayo's daughter, was married to [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso]], [[Duchy of Cantabria|Dux Peter of Cantabria]]'s son. Alphonse's son [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] married Munia, a Basque princess from Alava, while his daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.\n\nAfter Pelayo's death in 737, his son [[Favila of Asturias|Favila]] (or \"Fafila\") was elected king. Fafila, according to the chronicles, was unexpectedly killed by a bear while hunting in one of the trials of courage normally required of the nobility of that era. However, there is no other such incident known from the long history of monarchs and others at the sport, and the case is suspiciously similar to the Roman legend of their first king, [[Romulus]], taken by a sudden storm. The immediate consequence was that the rule of the Asturians passed to his brother-in-law, ruler of the neighboring independent domain, through a marriage alliance to Fafila's sister. The female ties and rights of inheritance were still respected, and in later cases would allow the regency or crown for their husbands too.\n\nPelayo founded a dynasty in Asturias that survived for decades and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries, until all of northwest Iberia was included by ca. 775. The reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] from 791 to 842 saw further expansion of the kingdom to the south, almost as far as [[Lisbon]].\n\n== Initial expansion ==\nFavila was succeeded by [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alphonse I]], who inherited the throne of Asturias thanks to his marriage to Pelayo's daughter, Ermesinda. The ''Albeldensian Chronicle'' narrated how Alphonse arrived in the kingdom some time after the battle of Covadonga to marry Ermesinda. Favila's death made his access to the throne possible as well as the rise of one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom of Asturias, the House of [[Cantabria]]. Initially, only Alphonse moved to the court in [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], but, after the progressive depopulation of the plateau and the Middle Valley of the [[Ebro]], where the main strongholds of the Duchy of Cantabria (e.g., Amaya, Tricio and the City of Cantabria) were located, the descendants of Duke Peter withdrew from [[Rioja, Almer\u00eda|Rioja]] towards the Cantabrian area and in time controlled the destiny of the Kingdom of Asturias.\n\nAlphonse began the territorial expansion of the small Christian kingdom from its first seat in the [[Picos de Europa]], advancing toward the west to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and toward the south with continuous incursions in the [[Douro]] valley, taking cities and towns and moving their inhabitants to the safer northern zones. It eventually led to the strategic depopulation of the plateau, creating the [[Desert of the Duero]] as a protection against future Moorish attacks.<ref name=\"Glick\"/>\n\nThe depopulation, defended by [[Claudio S\u00e1nchez-Albornoz y Mendui\u00f1a|Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz]], is doubted today, at least concerning its magnitude.<ref name=\"Glick\">{{Harvnb|Glick|2005|p=35}}</ref> Two main arguments are used to refute it: first, the minor toponymy was preserved in multiple districts; second, there are biological and cultural differences between the inhabitants of the Cantabrian zone and those of the central Plateau. What is true is that in the first half of the eighth century there was a process of rural growth that led to the abandonment of urban life and the organization of the population in small communities of shepherds. Several causes explain this process: the definitive breakdown of the production system based on slavery in existence from the time of the late [[Roman Empire]], the continuous propagation of epidemics in the area, and the abandonment of [[al-Andalus]] by the Berber regiments after the revolt of 740\u2013741. All this made possible the emergence of a sparsely populated and ill-organized area that insulated the Asturian kingdom from the Moorish assaults and allowed its progressive strengthening.\n\nThe campaigns of kings Alphonse I and Fruela in the Duero valley were probably not very different from the raids that the [[Astures]] made in the same area in the pre-Roman era. The initial Asturian expansion was carried out mainly through Cantabrian territory (from Galicia to [[Biscay|Vizcaya]]) and it was not until the reigns of [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]] and [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] that the Kingdom of Asturias could take effective possession of the territories located south of the [[Cantabrian Mountains]].\n\nFruela I, Alphonse I's son, consolidated and expanded his father's domains. He was assassinated by members of the nobility associated with the House of Cantabria.\n\n== Social and political transformations ==\nWritten sources are concise concerning the reigns of [[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelio]], [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]], [[Mauregatus of Asturias|Mauregatus]] and [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Bermudo I]]. Generally this period, with a duration of twenty-three years (768\u2013791), has been considered as a long stage of obscurity and retreat of the kingdom of Asturias. This version, defended by some historians, who even named this historical phase as that of the \"lazy kings,\" derived from the fact that, during it, there were apparently no important military actions against al-Andalus. However, there were relevant and decisive internal transformations, which provided a foundation for the strengthening and the expansion of Asturias.\n\nFirst, the first internal rebellion, led by Mauregato (783\u2013788), occurred during those years. The rebellion removed Alphonse II from the throne (although he became king again later, from 791 to 842).  This initiated a series of further rebellions whose principal leaders were members of ascending aristocratic palace groups and landowners who, based on the growing economic development of the area, tried to unseat the reigning family of Don Pelayo. The important rebellions of Nepociano, Aldroito and Piniolo, during the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842\u201350), are part of this process of economic, social, political and cultural transformation of the Asturian kingdom that occurred during the eighth and ninth centuries.\n\nSecond, neighboring rebellions by [[Basques]] and [[Galicians]] failed, quashed by Asturian kings. These rebels took advantage of the unrest in the central and Eastern part of Asturias, and, on occasion, provided help to one or another contender for the throne: by providing refuge to Alphonse II in [[Alava]] after his flight; the support for Nepociano's rebellion in some Asturian areas; and the adherence of Galicians to the cause of Ramiro I.\n\nFinally, other evidence suggests important internal transformations occurred during this time. Rebellions of [[freedman|freedmen]] (''serbi'', ''servilis orico'' and ''libertini'', according to the ''Chronicles'') occurred during the reign of Aurelio I. The property relationship between master and slave broke down progressively. This fact, together with the growing role of the individual and the restricted family, to the detriment of the extended family, is another indication that a new society was emerging in Asturias at the end of the eighth and beginning of the ninth centuries.\n\n[[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I]] (757\u201368) was succeeded by [[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelius]] (768\u201374), son of [[Fruela of Cantabria]] and Peter of Cantabria's grandson, who would establish the court in what is today the district of [[San Mart\u00edn del Rey Aurelio]], which previously belonged to Langreo. [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]] (774\u201383) succeeded Aurelio after his death, and transferred the court to [[Pravia]]. Silo was married to [[Adosinda]], one of the daughters of Alphonse I (and therefore, Pelayo's granddaughter).\n\nAlphonse II was elected king after Silo's death, but Mauregato organized a strong opposition and forced the new king to withdraw to lands in Alava (his mother, Munia, was Basque), obtaining the Asturian throne. The king, despite the bad reputation attributed by history, had good relations with [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]], perhaps the most important cultural figure of the kingdom, and supported him in his fight against [[Spanish Adoptionism|adoptionism]]. Legend says that Mauregato was Alphonse I's bastard son with a Moorish woman, and attributes to him the tribute of a hundred maidens. He was succeeded by Bermudo I, Aurelio's brother. He was called \"the deacon\", although he probably received only minor vows. Bermudo abdicated after a military defeat, ending his life in a monastery.\n\n== Recognition and later solidification ==\nIt was not until [[Alfonso II of Asturias|King Alfonso II]] (791\u2013842) that the kingdom was firmly established, after Silo's subjugated [[Gallaecia]] and confirmed territorial gains in western [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, USA|isbn= 0-631-19405-3|page=165}}</ref> Ties with the Carolingian Franks also got closer and more frequent, with Alfonso II's envoys presenting Charlemagne with spoils of war (campaign of Lisbon, 797).

They were considered authentic by a contemporary pope of Rome. However, during the Asturian period, the final resting place of [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]], located in Oviedo, became the primary religious site and focus of devotion.\n\nAlfonso II also repopulated parts of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Le\u00f3n (historical region)|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and incorporated them into the Kingdom of Asturia while establishing influence over parts of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basques]]. The first capital city was [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], near the site of the battle of Cavadonga. Then in [[Silo of Asturias|Silo's]] time, it was moved to [[Pravia]]. Alfonso II chose his birthplace of [[Oviedo]] as the capital of the kingdom (circa 789).\n\n[[File:Ramiro I Rex.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Ramiro I of Asturias]]]]\nRamiro I began his reign by capturing several other claimants to the throne, blinding them, and then confining them to monasteries.

In 859, Ordo\u00f1o besieged the fortress of Albelda, built by [[Musa ibn Musa]] of the [[Banu Qasi]], who had rebelled against Cordoba and became master of Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Toledo. Musa attempted to lift the siege in alliance with his brother-in-law Garc\u00eda I\u00f1iguez, the king of Pamplona, whose small realm was threatened by the eastwards expansion of the Asturian monarchy. In the battle that followed, Musa was defeated and lost valuable treasures in the process, some of which were sent as a gift to Charles the Bald of Francia. Seven days after the victory, Albelda fell and, as the chronicler records, \"its warriors were killed by the sword and the place itself was destroyed down to its foundations.\" Musa was wounded in the battle and died in 862/3; soon thereafter, Musa's son Lubb, governor of Toledo, submitted himself to the Asturian king for the rest of Ordo\u00f1o's reign.\n\nWhen Alfonso III's sons forced his abdication in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (Le\u00f3n and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of Le\u00f3n. It continued under that name until incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in 1230, after [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] became joint king of the two kingdoms.\n\n== Viking raids ==\nThe [[Vikings]] invaded Galicia in 844, but were decisively defeated by [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] at [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]].<ref name=Haywood/> Many of the Vikings' casualties were caused by the Galicians' [[ballista]]s \u2013 powerful torsion-powered projectile weapons that looked rather like giant [[crossbow]]s.<ref name=Haywood/><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brink |editor1-first=Stefan |editor2-last=Price |editor2-first=Neil |title=The Viking World |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> Seventy of the Vikings' [[longship]]s were captured on the beach and burned.<ref name=Haywood>{{cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=John |title=Northmen: The Viking Saga, AD 793\u20131241 |date=2015 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGmoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT189#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Vikings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Hh0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT207&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oman |first1=Charles |title=England Before the Norman Conquest |date=1924 |isbn=9785878048347 |page=422}}</ref> A few months later, another fleet [[Viking raid on Seville|took Seville]].

A Galician count of Visigothic descent, [[:es:Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez|Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez]], ended the Viking adventure in 971, when he launched an attack with a powerful army that defeated the Vikings in a bloody battle, and captured Gunrod, who was subsequently executed along with his followers.\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Remnants of Megalithic and Celtic paganism ===\n[[File:Dolmen santa cruz 3.jpg|thumb|left|The Santa Cruz dolmen, burial place of chieftains of the Eastern Asturian area since Megalithic times.]]\n\nAlthough the earliest evidence of Christian worship in Asturias dates from the 5th century, [[evangelism|evangelisation]] did not make any substantial progress until the middle of the sixth century, when hermits like [[Turibius of Li\u00e9bana]] and monks of the Saint Fructuoso order gradually settled in the Cantabrian mountains and began preaching the Christian doctrine.\n\nChristianisation progressed slowly in Asturias and did not necessarily supplant the ancient pagan divinities. As elsewhere in Europe, the new religion coexisted syncretically with features of the ancient beliefs. In the sixth century, bishop San Mart\u00edn de Braga complained in his work ''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'' about the Galician peasants being attached to the pre-Christian cults: \"Many demons, who were expelled from the heavens, settled in the sea, in the rivers, fountains and forests, and have come to be worshipped as gods by ignorant people. To them they do their sacrifices: in the sea they invoke Neptune, in the rivers the Lamias; in the fountains the Nymphs, and in the forests Diana.\"<ref>In Latin: \"Et in mare quidem Neptunum appellant, in fluminibus Lamias, in fontibus Nymphas, in silvis Dianas, quae omnia maligni daemones et spiritus nequam sunt, qui homines infideles, qui signaculo crucis nesciunt se munire, nocent et vexant\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Eibe.jpg|thumb|The [[yew tree]] is still very important in Asturian folklore, where it stands as a link to the [[afterlife]] and is commonly found planted beside churches and cemeteries.]]\nIn the middle of the Sella valley, where [[Cangas de On\u00eds]] is located, there was a dolmen area dating back to the [[megalith|megalithic era]], and was likely built between 4000 and 2000 BC. Chieftains from the surrounding regions were ritually buried here, particularly in the Santa Cruz dolmen. Such practices survived the Roman and Visigothic conquests. Even in the eighth century, King Favila was buried there, along with the bodies of tribal leaders. Although the Asturian monarchy fostered the Christianisation of this site, by constructing a church, to this day there are still pagan traditions linked with the Santa Cruz dolmen. It is said that ''[[xana]]s'' (Asturian fairies) appear to visitors, and magical properties are ascribed to the soil of the place.\n\nAccording to an inscription found in the Santa Cruz church, it was consecrated in 738 and was presided by a ''[[vates]]'' called Asterio. The word ''vates'' is uncommon in Catholic documents and epitaphs, where the word ''presbyterus'' (for Christian priests) is preferred. However, ''vates'' was used in Latin to denote a poet who was clairvoyant, and according to the Ancient Greek writers [[Strabo]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], and [[Posidonius]], the ''vates'' (\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) were also one of three classes of Celtic priesthood, the other two being the druids and the bards. Some historians think that Asterio held a religious office which combined elements of paganism and Christianity, while others think he may be linked to the Brythonic refugees that settled in [[Britonia]] (Galicia) in the 6th century. The ''Parrochiale Suevorum,'' an administrative document from the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]], states that the lands of Asturias belonged to the Britonian See, and some features of [[Celtic Christianity]] spread to Northern Spain. This is evidenced by the Celtic [[tonsure]], which the Visigothic bishops who participated in the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] condemned.<ref>Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo, \"Historia de los heterodoxos espa\u00f1oles I\", Madrid, 1978, chapter II, note 48</ref>\n\nStill extant Galician legends relate to monks who travelled by sea to the Paradise Islands, like those of [[Saint Amaro]], [[Trezenzonio]] or ''[[The Legend of Ero of Armenteira]]''. These stories have many parallels with those of [[Brendan]] the navigator, [[Malo (saint)|Malo]] of Wales, and the stories of the Irish [[immram]]a.\n\nAsturian kings promoted Christianity and did not base their power on indigenous religious traditions, unlike other medieval European kings such as [[Penda of Mercia]] or [[Widukind]], but on  Christian sacred scriptures (in particular, the books of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]) and the [[Church Fathers]]. These furnished the new monarchy with its foundational myths. They did not need to draft new laws since the [[Visigothic Code]] was the referential code, at least since the arrival of new influences including exiles, prisoners from the central area of al-Andalus in the 770s along with their mixed Berber-Arabic and Gothic legacy. This combined with governmental and religious ideas imported from [[Charlemagne]]'s Frankish Kingdom ([[Alcuin]]-[[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]]).\n\n=== Adoptionism ===\n{{main|Spanish Adoptionism}}\nThe foundations of Asturian culture and that of Christian Spain in the [[High Middle Ages]] were laid during the reigns of [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]] and Mauregatus, when the Asturian kings submitted to the authority of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] emirs of the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. The most prominent Christian scholar in the Kingdom of Asturias of this period was Beatus of Li\u00e9bana, whose works left an indelible mark on the Christian culture of the Reconquista.\n\n[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFolios45v46rWorldMap.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beatus map]].]]\n\nBeatus was directly involved in the debate surrounding adoptionism, which argued that [[Jesus]] was born a man, and was adopted by God and acquired a divine dimension only after his [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and [[resurrection]]. Beatus refuted this theological position, championed by such figures as [[Elipando]], bishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].\n\nThe adoptionist theology had its roots in Gothic [[Arianism]], which denied the divinity of Jesus, and in [[Hellenistic religion]], with examples of heroes like [[Heracles]] who, after their death attained the [[apotheosis]]. Likewise, as Elipandus's bishopric of Toledo was at the time within the Muslim Caliphate of Cordoba, Islamic beliefs which acknowledged Jesus as a Prophet, but not as the Son of God, influenced the formation of adoptionism. However, the adoptionist theology was opposed strongly by Beatus from his abbey in [[Santo Toribio de Li\u00e9bana]]. At the same time, Beatus strengthened the links among Asturias, the [[Holy See]], and the [[Carolingian Empire]], and was supported in his theological struggle by the [[Pope]] and by his friend Alcuin of York, an Anglo-Saxon scholar who had settled among the Carolingian court in [[Aachen]].\n\n=== Millennialism ===\n[[File:B Valladolid 120.jpg|thumb|left|''The Angel of the Fifth Trumpet'', an example of a Beatus manuscript.]]\nThe most transcendental works of Beatus were his ''Commentaries to Apocalypse'', which were copied in later centuries in manuscripts called ''beati'', about which the Italian writer [[Umberto Eco]] said: \"Their splendid images gave birth to the most relevant iconographic happening in the History of Mankind\".<ref>Umberto Eco wrote an essay about them, ''Beato di Liebana'' (1976)</ref> Beatus develops in them a personal interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], accompanied by quotes from the [[Old Testament]], the [[Church Fathers]] and fascinating illustrations.\n\nIn these ''Commentaries'' a new interpretation of the apocalyptic accounts is given: [[Babylon]] no longer represents the city of Rome, but C\u00f3rdoba, seat of the Umayyad emirs of al-Andalus; the Beast, once a symbol of the Roman Empire, now stands for the Islamic invaders who during this time threatened to destroy Western Christianity, and who raided territories of the Asturian Kingdom.\n\nThe prologue to the second book of the ''Commentaries'' contains the [[Beatus map]], one of the best examples of a ''[[mappa mundi]]'' of the high medieval culture. The purpose of this map was not to represent the world cartographically, but to illustrate the Apostles' diaspora in the first decades of Christianity. Beatus took data from the works of [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Ptolemy]] and the [[Bible]]. The world was represented as a land disc surrounded by the Ocean and divided in three parts: Asia (upper semicircle), Europe (lower left quadrant) and Africa (lower right quadrant). The Mediterranean Sea (Europe-Africa), the Nile River (Africa-Asia), the Aegean Sea, and the Bosphorus (Europe-Asia) were set as the boundaries between the different continents.\n\nBeatus believed that the [[Apocalypse]] described in the book of Revelation was imminent, which would be followed by 1290 years of domination by the [[Antichrist]]. Beatus followed the views of [[Augustine of Hippo]], whose work, [[the City of God (book)|''The City of God'']], influenced the ''Commentaries'' which followed the premise that the history of the world was structured in six ages. The first five ones extended from the creation of [[Adam]] to the Passion of Jesus, while the sixth, subsequent to Christ, ends with the unleashing of the events prophesied in the book of Revelation.\n[[File:B Facundus 224vd\u00e9t.jpg|thumb|For Beatus of Li\u00e9bana, the [[Whore of Babylon]] (Revelation, 17.4-5)<ref>\"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.\"</ref> (a Christian allegory of evil) was incarnated by the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nMillennialist movements were very common in Europe at that time. Between 760 and 780, a series of cosmic phenomena stirred up panic among the population of [[Gaul]]; John, a visionary monk, predicted the coming of the [[Last Judgment]] during the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. In this time  the Apocalypse of Daniel appeared, a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text redacted during the rule of the empress [[Irene of Athens]], wherein wars between the [[Arabs]], the Byzantines and the Northern peoples were prophesied. These wars would end with the coming of the Antichrist.\n\nEvents taking place in Hispania (Islamic rule, the adoptionist heresy, the gradual assimilation of the [[Mozarabs]]) were, for Beatus, signals of the imminent apocalypse. [[aeon]]. As Elipandus describes in his ''Letter from the bishops of Spania to their brothers in Gaul'', the abbot of Santo Toribio went so far as to announce to his countrymen the coming of the End of Time on Easter of the year 800. On the dawn of that day, hundreds of peasants met around the abbey of Santo Toribio, waiting, terrified, for the fulfillment of the prophecy. They remained in there, without eating for a day and half, until one of them, named Ordonius, exclaimed: \"Let us eat and drink, so that if the End of the World comes we are full!\".\n\nThe prophetic and millennialist visions of Beatus produced an enduring mark in the development of the Kingdom of Asturias: the ''Chronica Prophetica'', which was written around 880 CE, predicted the final fall of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba, and the conquest and redemption of the entire [[Iberian Peninsula]] by king Alfonso III. Millennialist imagery is also reflected throughout the kingdom in the [[Victory Cross]] icon, the major emblem of the Asturian kingdom, which has its origins in a passage of the Revelation book in which [[John of Patmos]] relates a vision of the [[Second Coming]]. He sees Jesus Christ seated in his majesty, surrounded by clouds and affirming: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty\".<ref>Revelation, 1.8.</ref> It is true that usage of the [[labarum]] was not restricted to Asturias, and dates back to the time of [[Constantine the Great]], who used this symbol during the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. However, it was in Asturias where the Cruz de la Victoria attained a general use: in nearly every [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|pre-Romanesque]] church this icon is engraved,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.educastur.princast.es/asturias/espacio/150recursos/recursos/imagenes/47.jpg |title=The '&#39;Cruz de la Victoria'&#39; engraved in stone |accessdate=2014-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227170713/http://www.educastur.princast.es/asturias/espacio/150recursos/recursos/imagenes/47.jpg |archive-date=2008-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.comarcavaqueira.com/scripts/museoprerromanico.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208082231/http://www.comarcavaqueira.com/scripts/museoprerromanico.asp |date=February 8, 2012 }}</ref> often accompanied with the expression \"Hoc signo tuetur pius, in hoc signo vincitur inimicus\",<ref>\"With this sign thou shalt defend the pious, with this sign thou shalt defeat the enemy\".</ref> that became the royal motto of the Asturian monarchs.\n\n=== Camino de Santiago ===\nAnother of the major spiritual legacies of the Asturian kingdom is the creation of one of the most important ways of cultural transmission in European history: the [[Camino de Santiago]]. The first text which mentions St. James' preaching in Spain is the ''Breviarius de Hyerosolima'', a 6th-century document which stated that the Apostle was buried in an enigmatic place called ''Aca Marmarica''. Isidore of Seville supported this theory in his work ''De ortu et obitu patrium''. One hundred and fifty years later, in the times of Mauregato, the hymn ''O Dei Verbum'' rendered St. James as \"the golden head of Spain, our protector and national patron\" and a mention is made of his preaching in the Iberian Peninsula during the first decades of Christianity. Some attribute this hymn to Beatus, although this is still discussed by historians.\n\nThe legend of St. James gained support during the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]. The period was marked by Alfonso II's reaching out to Charlemagne for military assistance and importation of similar royal ceremonies and governmental structures. Galician hermit Pelayo claimed to observe a mysterious brightness during several nights over the wood of Libred\u00f3n, in Iria Flavia diocese. Angelic songs accompanied the lights. Impressed by this phenomenon, Pelayo appeared before the bishop of Iria Flavia, Teodomirus, who \u2013 after having heard the hermit \u2013 visited the location with his retinue. Legend has it that in the depths of the forest was found a stone sepulchre with three corpses, which were identified as those of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James, son of Zebedee]], and his two disciples, Theodorus and Atanasius. According to the legend, King Alfonso was the first pilgrim who had come to see the Apostle.  During his travels he was guided at night by the [[Milky Way]], which from then on acquired the name of ''Camino de Santiago''.\n\nThe founding of the alleged St. James tomb was a formidable political success for the Kingdom of Asturias: Now Asturias could claim the honour of having the body of one of the apostles of Jesus, a privilege shared only with Asia ([[Ephesus]]) where [[John the Apostle]] was buried, and Rome, where the bodies of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] rested. As of the early 12th century, [[Santiago de Compostela#History|Santiago de Compostela]] grew to become one of the three sacred cities of Christianity, together with Rome and [[Jerusalem]]. In later centuries, many Central European cultural influences travelled to Iberia through the Way of St. James, from the Gothic and Romanesque styles, to the Occitan lyric poetry.\n\nHowever, the story of the \"discovery\" of the remains of the Apostle shows some enigmatic features. The tomb was found in a place used as a [[necropolis]] since the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Late Roman Empire]], so it is possible that the body belonged to a prominent person of the area. [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] hypothesized the tomb of Compostela actually hold the remains of [[Priscillian]]. Historian Roger Collins holds that the identification of the relics (at any rate nothing close to a full body) with Saint James is related to the translation of the remains found under a 6th-century church altar in M\u00e9rida, where various saint names are listed, Saint James among them. Other scholars, like Constantino Cabal, highlighted the fact that several Galician places, such as Pico Sacro, Pedra da Barca (Mux\u00eda) or San Andr\u00e9s de Teixido, were already draws for pagan pilgrimage in pre-Roman times. Pagan beliefs held these places as the End of the World and as entrances to the Celtic [[Otherworld]]. After the discovery of Saint James' tomb, the gradual Christianization of those pilgrimage routes began.\n\n=== Mythology ===\n[[File:ErcinaLakeHorse.jpg|thumb|[[Lakes of Covadonga|Ercina lake]], [[Covadonga]]. According to the legend, under its waters a village -or perhaps a city- is hidden.]]\n\nSince the Chronicles of the Asturian kingdom were written a century and a half after the battle of Covadonga, there are many aspects of the first Asturian kings that remain shrouded in myth and legend.\n\nAlthough the historicity of Pelayo is beyond doubt, the historical narrative describing him includes many folktales and legends. One of them asserts that, prior to the Muslim invasion, Pelayo went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the sacred city of Christianity. However, there is no extant evidence of this.\n\nLikewise, it is also said that the ''Cruz de la Victoria'' was at first carved in an oak's log by a lightning strike.<ref>''Simbolog\u00eda m\u00e1gico-tradicional'', Alberto \u00c1lvarez Pe\u00f1a, page 147.</ref> The core of this story contains two elements of major importance in the Asturian folklore. On one hand, lightning was the ancient symbol of the Astur god [[Taranis]], and in Asturian mythology was thought to be forged by the [[Nuberu]], lord of clouds, rain and wind. On the other hand, the oak tree is the symbol of the Asturian royalty and in reliefs of the Abamia Church (where Pelayo was buried) leaves of that tree are shown.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have happened in a shepherd village where today [[Lakes of Covadonga|Lakes Enol and Ercina]] are situated. [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]], disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered everything except the cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started to cry, and her tears became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Folio 103v - Hezekiah's Canticle.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Hezekiah's Canticle belonging to the ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''. The Asturian monarchs often took the kings of the Old Testament as their models.]]\nThere are also myths about the Asturian monarchy that are rooted in Jewish and Christian traditions rather than pagan ones: the ''Chronica ad Sebastianum'' tells of an extraordinary event that happened when Alfonso I died.{{cn|date=March 2020}} While the noblemen were holding a wake for him, there could be heard celestial canticles sung by angels. They recited the following text of the Book of Isaiah (which happens to be the same that was read by the Mozarabic priests during the [[Vigil]] of the [[Holy Saturday]]):\n{{quote|I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.<br/>I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.<br/>Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br/>I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br/>Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.|Is. 38,10-14}}\nThis canticle was recited by [[Hezekiah]], king of Judah, after his recovery from a serious illness. In these verses, the king regretted with distress his departure to [[sheol]], the Jewish underworld, a shady place where he would not see God nor men any more.\n\n[[File:Santa Maria del Naranco.jpg|thumb|Church of [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco]]. Eastern fa\u00e7ade. This is probably the finest example of Asturian architecture.]] \nAsturias also has examples of the [[king in the mountain]] myth. According to the tradition, it is still today possible to see king [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] walking around the ''Jard\u00edn de los Reyes Caudillos''<ref>''Relatos legendarios sobre los or\u00edgenes pol\u00edticos de Asturias y Vizcaya en la Edad Media'', Arsenio F. Dacosta, Actas del VII Congreso Internacional de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Semi\u00f3tica (Volumen II).</ref> (a part of the Oviedo Cathedral), and it is said that his grandson, the famous cavalier [[Bernardo del Carpio]], sleeps in a cave in the Asturian mountains. The story tells that one day a peasant went into a certain cave to retrieve his lost cow and heard a strong voice who declared to be Bernardo del Carpio, victor over the Franks in [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|Roncevaux]].<ref>In medieval Spain, it was commonly thought that it was the Asturians or the Moors, and not the Basques, who beat the Franks in this battle.</ref> After saying he had lived alone for centuries in that cave, he told the peasant: \"Give me your hand, so that I can see how strong are men today\". The shepherd, scared, gave him the horn of the cow, which, when seized by the giant man, was immediately broken. The poor villager ran away terrified, but not without hearing Bernardo say: \"Current men are not like those who helped me to kill Frenchmen in Roncevaux\".<ref>[http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pNumEjemplar=956&pIdSeccion=68&pIdNoticia=305131 Bernardo del Carpiu y otros guerreros durmientes]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Alberto \u00c1lvarez Pe\u00f1a</ref><ref>''Los maestros asturianos'' (Juan Lobo, 1931)</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Kingdom of Asturias was, in its infancy, an indigenous reaction of Astures and Cantabri to a foreign invasion. These people had already fought the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[Cantabrian Wars]], and initially resisted [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]]. Although they preserved many characteristics of their pre-Roman culture, their [[Celtic languages]] were later lost in favor of [[Latin]].\n\nThis kingdom is the birthplace of an influential European [[medieval architecture|medieval architectural style]]: Asturian pre-Romanesque. This style of architecture was founded during the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]].\n\nThis small kingdom was a milestone in the fight against the adoptionist heresy, with Beatus of Li\u00e9bana as a major figure. In the time of Alfonso II, the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]] was \"found.\" The pilgrimage to Santiago, Cami\u00f1o de Santiago, was a major nexus within Europe, and many pilgrims (and their money) passed through Asturias on their way to Santiago de Compostela.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Asturian art]]\n*[[Autonomous communities in Spain|Autonomous community]] of [[Asturias]].\n*[[List of Asturian monarchs]]\n**[[List of Asturian monarchs#Family tree|Monarchs' family tree]]\n*[[Reconquista]]\n*[[Timeline of the Muslim occupation of the Iberian Peninsula]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|last=Glick| first=Thomas |title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages|publisher=Brill|location =Leiden |year=2005 |isbn=90-04-14771-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWqmebvcjj0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}\n\n{{Commons category}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.mirabiliaovetensia.com Information and virtual reconstructions of early monuments of Oviedo]\n\n{{Monarchs of Asturias}}\n{{Asturian Art|state=collapsed}}\n{{Spanish Kingdoms |state=collapsed}}\n{{Asturias topics}}\n\n{{coord|43|21|45|N|5|50|35|W|source:kolossus-itwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingdom Of Asturias}}\n[[Category:Kingdom of Asturias| ]]\n[[Category:History of Asturias]]\n[[Category:Medieval Portugal]]\n[[Category:Medieval Spain]]\n[[Category:Former countries on the Iberian Peninsula|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Spanish history|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Former kingdoms|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Europe|Asturias]]\n[[Category:History of Al-Andalus]]\n[[Category:History of Portugal by polity|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Pelagius of Asturias]]\n[[Category:Reconquista]]\n[[Category:8th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:8th century in Spain]]\n[[Category:9th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:9th century in Spain]]\n[[Category:10th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:10th century in Spain]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 710s]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in the 920s]]\n[[Category:718 establishments]]\n[[Category:924 disestablishments]]\n<!---[[Category:8th-century establishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:8th-century establishments in Spain]]--->\n<!---[[Category:10th-century disestablishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:10th-century disestablishments in Spain]]--->\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Former kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula}}\n{{Infobox Former Country\n| native_name = {{lang|la|Regnum Asturorum}}\n| conventional_long_name = Kingdom of Asturias\n| common_name     = Kingdom of Asturias\n| era             = Early Middle Ages\n| government_type = [[Elective Monarchy]]\n| event_start =\n| year_start  = 718/722<ref>Collins, Roger (1989).

It was the first [[Christendom|Christian political entity]] established after the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad conquest of Visigothic Hispania]] in 718 or 722.<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, USA|isbn= 0-631-19405-3|page=49}}</ref> That year, Pelagius defeated an [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] army at the [[Battle of Covadonga]], in what is usually regarded as the beginning of the ''[[Reconquista]]''.\n\nThe [[List of Asturian monarchs|Asturian kings]] were happy to make peace with the [[Muslims]] when it suited them, particularly if it left them free to pursue their other enemies, the [[Basques]] and rebels in Galicia. Thus [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] (757\u201368) killed 40,000 Muslims but also defeated the Basques and [[Galicians]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Medieval Frontiers: Concepts and Practices |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> and [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]] (774\u201383) made peace with the Muslims but not with the Galicians. Under King [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] (791\u2013842), the kingdom was firmly established with Alfonso's recognition as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Pope]]. He conquered [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and the Basques. During his reign, the holy bones of St [[James the Great]] were declared to be found in Galicia, in Compostela (from Latin ''campus stellae'', literally \"the field of the star\"). Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a way of communication between the isolated Asturias and the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] lands and beyond. Alfonso's policy consisted in depopulating the borders of [[Bardulia]] (which would turn into Castile) in order to gain population support north of the mountains. With this growth came a corresponding increase in military forces. The kingdom was now strong enough to sack the [[Moors|Moorish]] cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]] and [[Coimbra]]. However, for centuries to come the focus of these actions was not conquest but pillage and tribute. In the summers of 792, 793 and 794 several Muslim attacks plundered Alava, and the heart of the Asturian kingdom, reaching up to the capital, Oviedo. In one of the retreats, Alfonso inflicted a [[Battle of Lutos|severe defeat]] on the Muslims in the swampy area of Lutos, killing 70,000.<ref>Roger Collins, ''Caliphs and Kings: Spain, 796-1031'', 65.</ref>\n\nWhen Alfonso II died, [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842\u201350) staged a coup against the ''Count of the Palace'' [[Nepotian of Asturias|Nepotian]], who had taken the throne. After a battle on a bridge over the river Narcea, Nepotian was captured in flight, blinded and then forced into monastic life. Early in his reign, Ramiro was faced with a [[Viking raid on Galicia and Asturias|Viking attack]] at a place called ''Farum Brecantium'', believed to be present-day [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]]. He gathered an army in Galicia and Asturias and defeated the [[Vikings]], killing many of them and burning their ships.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=John |title=Northmen: The Viking Saga, AD 793\u20131241 |date=2015 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGmoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT189#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Flood |first1=Timothy M. |title=Rulers and Realms in Medieval Iberia, 711\u20131492 |date=2018 |publisher=McFarland |page=30}}</ref> In 859, a second Viking fleet set out for Spain.

Gil, Cr\u00f3nicas Asturianas, 1985, p. 176</ref> The considerable territorial expansion of the Asturian kingdom under [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] (866\u2013910) was largely made possible by the collapse of Umayyad control over many parts of [[Al-Andalus]] at this time. Between the years 866 and 881, the western frontier of the kingdom in Galicia was expanded into the northern part of modern-day [[Portugal]]. The year 878 saw a Muslim assault on the towns of Astorga and Le\u00f3n. The expedition consisted of two detachments, one of which was decisively defeated at [[Battle of Polvoraria|Polvoraria]] on the river Orbigo, with an alleged loss of 13,000 men. In 881, Alfonso took the offensive, leading an army deep into the Lower March, crossing the Tagus River to approach Merida. Then miles from the city the Asturian army crossed the Guadiana River and defeated the Umayyad army on \"Monte Oxifer\", allegedly leaving 15,000 Muslim soldiers killed. Returning home, Alfonso devoted himself to building the churches of Oviedo and constructing one or more two palaces for himself.\n\nThe Kingdom of Asturias transitioned into the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] in 924, when [[Fruela II of Asturias]] became king with his royal court in Le\u00f3n.<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1983 | title = Early Medieval Spain | publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York|isbn= 0-312-22464-8|page = 238}}</ref>\n\n== Indigenous background ==\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 910-es.svg|thumb|left|Kingdom of Asturias, circa 910&nbsp;AD]]\nThe kingdom originated in the western and central territory of the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], particularly the [[Picos de Europa]] and the central area of Asturias. The main political and military events during the first decades of the kingdom's existence took place in the region. According to the descriptions of [[Strabo]], [[Cassius Dio]] and other Graeco-Roman geographers, several peoples of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited the lands of Asturias at the beginning of the Christian era, most notably:\n\n*in the [[Cantabri]], the ''Vadinienses'', who inhabited the Picos de Europa region and whose settlement gradually expanded southward during the first centuries of the modern era\n*the ''Orgenomesci'', who dwelled along the Asturian eastern coast\n*in the [[Astures]], the ''Saelini'', whose settlement extended through the [[Sella River (Bay of Biscay)|Sella Valley]]\n*the ''Luggones'', who had their capital in ''Lucus Asturum'' and whose territories stretched between the Sella and Nal\u00f3n\n*the ''Astures'' (in the strictest sense), who dwelled in inner Asturias, between the current councils of [[Pilo\u00f1a]] and [[Cangas del Narcea]]\n*the ''Paesici'', who had settled along the coast of Western Asturias, between the mouth of the Navia river and the modern city of [[Gij\u00f3n]]\n\n[[File:Somiedo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Picture of ''\u1e37\u1e37agu del Va\u1e37\u1e37e'' ([[Somiedo]]), showing typical Asturian cottages (called ''teitos''), as already in use in the time of the [[Astures]]]]\n\nClassical geographers give conflicting views of the ethnic description of the above-mentioned peoples. [[Ptolemy]] says that the Astures extended along the central area of current Asturias, between the Navia and Sella rivers, fixing the latter river as the boundary with the Cantabrian territory. However, other geographers placed the frontier between the Astures and the Cantabri further to the east: [[Julius Honorius]] stated in his ''Cosmographia'' that the springs of the river [[Ebro]] were located in the land of the Astures (''sub asturibus''). In any case, ethnic borders in the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] were not so important after that time, as the clan divisions that permeated the pre-Roman societies of all the peoples of Northern Iberia faded under similar political administrative culture imposed on them by the Romans.\n\nThe situation started to change during the Late [[Roman Empire]] and the early [[Middle Ages]], when an Asturian identity gradually started to develop: the centuries-old fight between [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] and [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebian nobles]] may have helped to forge a distinct identity among the peoples of the Cantabrian districts. Several archaeological digs in the ''[[Castros (Spain)|castro]]'' of La Carisa (municipality of Lena) have found remnants of a defensive line whose main purpose was to protect the valleys of central Asturias from invaders who came from [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|the Meseta]] through the Pajares pass: the construction of these fortifications reveals a high degree of organization and cooperation among the several Asturian communities, in order to defend themselves from the southern invaders. [[Carbon-14]] tests have found that the wall dates from the period 675\u2013725&nbsp;AD, when two armed expeditions against the Asturians took place: one of them headed by Visigothic king [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] (reigned 672\u2013680); the other by Muslim governor [[Musa bin Nusayr]] during the Umayyad conquest, who settled garrisons over its territory.\n\nThe gradual formation of Asturian identity led to the creation of the Kingdom of Asturias after Pelagius' coronation and the victory over the Muslim garrisons in [[Battle of Covadonga|Covadonga]] in the early 8th century. The ''Chronica Albeldense'', in narrating the happenings of Covadonga, stated that \"Divine providence brings forth the King of Asturias\".\n\n== Umayyad occupation and Asturian revolt ==\n[[File:Covadonga, conjunto paisaj\u00edstico, Pelayo (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Monument in memory of Pelagius in [[Covadonga]]]]\nThe kingdom was established by the nobleman Pelayo ({{lang-la|Pelagius}}), possibly an Asturian noble. No substantial movement of refugees from central Iberia could have taken place before the [[Battle of Covadonga]], and in 714 Asturias was overrun by Musa bin Nusayr with no effective or known opposition.<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1983 | title = Early Medieval Spain | publisher = St. Martin's Press |location = New York|isbn= 0-312-22464-8|page = 229}}</ref> It has also been claimed that he may have retired to the Asturian mountains after the [[Battle of Guadalete]], where in the Gothic tradition of [[Teia|Theias]] he was elected by the other nobles as leader of the [[Astures]]. Pelayo's kingdom was initially little more than a rallying banner for existing guerilla forces.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA88 |title=Encyclopedia of African American History - Google B\u0159ker |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EAgAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA294 |title=Encyclop\u0107dia metropolitana; or, Universal dictionary of knowledge ... - Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Google B\u0159ker |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the progress of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the main cities and administrative centers fell into the hands of Muslim troops. Control of the central and southern regions, such as the [[Guadalquivir]] and Ebro valleys, presented few problems for the newcomers, who used the existing Visigothic administrative structures, ultimately of Roman origin. However, in the northern mountains, urban centers (such as [[Gij\u00f3n|Gigia]]) were practically nonexistent and the submission of the country had to be achieved valley by valley. Muslim troops often resorted to the taking of hostages to ensure the pacification of the newly conquered territory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAfter the first incursion of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad|Tarik]], who reached Toledo in 711, the Yemeni viceroy of [[Ifriqiya]], [[Musa bin Nusayr]], crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] the following year and carried out a massive operation of conquest that would lead to the capture of M\u00e9rida, Toledo, Zaragoza and Lerida, among other cities. During the last phase of his military campaign, he reached the northwest of the Peninsula, where he gained control of the localities of [[Lugo]] and [[Gij\u00f3n]]. In the latter city, he placed a small Berber detachment under a governor, [[Munuza]], whose mission was to consolidate Muslim control over Asturias. As a guarantee of the submission of the region, some nobles \u2013 some argue that Pelayo was among them \u2013 had to surrender hostages from Asturias to Cordoba. The legend says that his sister was asked for, and a marriage alliance sought with the local Berber leader. Later on, Munuza would try to do the same at another mountain post in the Pyrenees, where he rebelled against his Cordoban Arab superiors. The [[Berbers]] had been converted to Islam barely a generation earlier, and were considered second rank to Arabs and Syrians. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe most commonly accepted hypothesis for the battle (epic as described by later Christian Asturian sources, but a mere skirmish in Muslim texts) is that the Moorish column was attacked from the cliffs and then fell back through the valleys towards present day Gij\u00f3n, but it was attacked in retreat by the retinue and nearly destroyed. However, the only near-contemporary account of the events of the time, the Christian [[Chronicle of 754]], makes no mention of the incident.\n\nHowever, as is told in the ''Rotensian Chronicle'' <ref>This is the chronicle of [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] in which Pelayo is considered the successor of the kings of Toledo, with the clear goal of establishing Alfonso's political legitimacy.</ref> as well as in that of [[Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari]],<ref>A Maghrebi historian of the 16th century who died in Cairo, Egypt, and who could have used the ''Rotensian Chronicle'' and rewritten it eight centuries later, making it useless as a historical document.</ref> Pelayo escaped from Cordoba during the governorship of [[Al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi|al-Hurr]] (717\u2013718) and his return to Asturias triggered a revolt against the Muslim authorities of Gij\u00f3n. The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that is only one of the theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, lived at that time in Bres, in the district of [[Pilo\u00f1a]], and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the [[Pilo\u00f1a (river)|Pilo\u00f1a]] and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Mt. Auseva, taking refuge in one of its caves, [[Covadonga]]. After an attempted siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, the troops are said to have exited through the high ports to the south, in order to continue their search-and-destroy mission against other rebels. There, the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was annihilated. The rest of its survivors continued south to the plains of [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Leon]], leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed.\n\nThe victory, relatively small, as only a few Berber soldiers were involved, resulted in great prestige for Pelayo and provoked a massive insurrection by other nobles in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]] who immediately rallied around him, electing him King or military [[Dux]].\n\nUnder Pelayo's leadership, the attacks on the [[Berbers]] increased. Munuza, feeling isolated in a region increasingly hostile, decided to abandon Gij\u00f3n and headed for the Plateau (''Meseta'') through the Mesa Trail.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, he was intercepted and killed by Astures at Olal\u00edes (in the current district of [[Grado, Asturias|Grado]]). Once he had expelled the Moors from the eastern valleys of Asturias, Pelayo attacked [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]], the main city in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and secured the mountain passes, insulating the region from Moorish attack.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Pelayo continued attacking those Berbers who remained north of the Asturian Mountains until they withdrew, but the latter mostly deserted their garrisons in response to the wider rebellion against Arab control from Cordoba. He then married his daughter, Ermesinda, to Alfonso, the son of Peter of Cantabria, the leading noble at the still-independent Visigothic duchy of [[Cantabria]]. His son Favila was married to Froiliuba.\n\nRecent archaeological excavations have found fortifications in Mount Homon and La Carisa (near the Huerna and Pajares valleys) dated between the end of the seventh and beginning of the eighth centuries. The Berber fortifications included watchtowers and moats of almost two meters, in whose construction and defense many hundreds may have participated. That would have required a high degree of organization and firm leadership, probably by Pelayo himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pNumEjemplar=1295&pIdSeccion=38&pIdNoticia=412025|title=La Nueva Espaa - Diario Independiente de Asturias|author=La Nueva Espaa|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Therefore, experts consider it probable that the construction of the defensive line was intended to prevent the reentry of Moors into Asturias through the mountain passes of Mesa and Pajares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pNumEjemplar=1336&pIdSeccion=39&pIdNoticia=424603|title=La Nueva Espaa - Diario Independiente de Asturias|author=La Nueva Espaa|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pelayo en la batalla de Covadonga BNE Mss 2805 f 23r (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|King Pelagius at the Battle of Covadonga]]\nAfter Pelayo's victory over the Moorish detachment at the [[Battle of Covadonga]], a small territorial independent entity was established in the Asturian mountains that was the origin of the kingdom of Asturias. Pelayo's leadership was not comparable to that of the Visigothic kings. The first kings of Asturias referred to themselves as \"princeps\" (prince) and later as \"rex\" (king), but the later title was not firmly established until the period of Alphonse II. The title of \"''[[princeps]]''\" had been used by the indigenous peoples of Northern Spain and its use appears in Galician and Cantabrian inscriptions, in which expressions like \"N\u00edcer, Pr\u00edncipe de los Albiones\"<ref>The Asturian writer Juan Noriega made him one of the main characters of ''[[La Noche Celta]]'' (''The Celtic Night''), set in the castle of Coa\u00f1a.</ref> (on an inscription found in the district of Coa\u00f1a) and \"''princeps cantabrorum''\"<ref>''Doviderio, Pr\u00edncipe de los C\u00e1ntabros''.</ref> (over a gravestone of the municipality of Cistierna, in Leon). In fact, the Kingdom of Asturias originated as a focus of leadership over other peoples of the Cantabrian Coast that had resisted the Romans as well as the Visigoths and that were not willing to subject themselves to the dictates of the Umayyad Caliphate. Immigrants from the south, fleeing from Al-Andalus, brought a Gothic influence to the Asturian kingdom. However, at the beginning of the 9th century, Alphonse II's will cursed the Visigoths, blaming them for the loss of Hispania. The later chronicles on which knowledge of the period is based, all written during the reign of Alphonse III, when there was great Gothic ideological influence, are the Sebastianensian Chronicle (''Cr\u00f3nica Sebastianense''), the Albeldensian Chronicle (''Cr\u00f3nica Albeldense'') and the Rotensian Chronicle (''Cr\u00f3nica Rotense'').\n\nDuring the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax and so it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelayo's daughter, was married to [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso]], [[Duchy of Cantabria|Dux Peter of Cantabria]]'s son. Alphonse's son [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] married Munia, a Basque princess from Alava, while his daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.\n\nAfter Pelayo's death in 737, his son [[Favila of Asturias|Favila]] (or \"Fafila\") was elected king. Fafila, according to the chronicles, was unexpectedly killed by a bear while hunting in one of the trials of courage normally required of the nobility of that era. However, there is no other such incident known from the long history of monarchs and others at the sport, and the case is suspiciously similar to the Roman legend of their first king, [[Romulus]], taken by a sudden storm. The immediate consequence was that the rule of the Asturians passed to his brother-in-law, ruler of the neighboring independent domain, through a marriage alliance to Fafila's sister. The female ties and rights of inheritance were still respected, and in later cases would allow the regency or crown for their husbands too.\n\nPelayo founded a dynasty in Asturias that survived for decades and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries, until all of northwest Iberia was included by ca. 775. The reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]] from 791 to 842 saw further expansion of the kingdom to the south, almost as far as [[Lisbon]].\n\n== Initial expansion ==\nFavila was succeeded by [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alphonse I]], who inherited the throne of Asturias thanks to his marriage to Pelayo's daughter, Ermesinda. The ''Albeldensian Chronicle'' narrated how Alphonse arrived in the kingdom some time after the battle of Covadonga to marry Ermesinda. Favila's death made his access to the throne possible as well as the rise of one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom of Asturias, the House of [[Cantabria]]. Initially, only Alphonse moved to the court in [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], but, after the progressive depopulation of the plateau and the Middle Valley of the [[Ebro]], where the main strongholds of the Duchy of Cantabria (e.g., Amaya, Tricio and the City of Cantabria) were located, the descendants of Duke Peter withdrew from [[Rioja, Almer\u00eda|Rioja]] towards the Cantabrian area and in time controlled the destiny of the Kingdom of Asturias.\n\nAlphonse began the territorial expansion of the small Christian kingdom from its first seat in the [[Picos de Europa]], advancing toward the west to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and toward the south with continuous incursions in the [[Douro]] valley, taking cities and towns and moving their inhabitants to the safer northern zones. It eventually led to the strategic depopulation of the plateau, creating the [[Desert of the Duero]] as a protection against future Moorish attacks.<ref name=\"Glick\"/>\n\nThe depopulation, defended by [[Claudio S\u00e1nchez-Albornoz y Mendui\u00f1a|Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz]], is doubted today, at least concerning its magnitude.<ref name=\"Glick\">{{Harvnb|Glick|2005|p=35}}</ref> Two main arguments are used to refute it: first, the minor toponymy was preserved in multiple districts; second, there are biological and cultural differences between the inhabitants of the Cantabrian zone and those of the central Plateau. What is true is that in the first half of the eighth century there was a process of rural growth that led to the abandonment of urban life and the organization of the population in small communities of shepherds. Several causes explain this process: the definitive breakdown of the production system based on slavery in existence from the time of the late [[Roman Empire]], the continuous propagation of epidemics in the area, and the abandonment of [[al-Andalus]] by the Berber regiments after the revolt of 740\u2013741. All this made possible the emergence of a sparsely populated and ill-organized area that insulated the Asturian kingdom from the Moorish assaults and allowed its progressive strengthening.\n\nThe campaigns of kings Alphonse I and Fruela in the Duero valley were probably not very different from the raids that the [[Astures]] made in the same area in the pre-Roman era. The initial Asturian expansion was carried out mainly through Cantabrian territory (from Galicia to [[Biscay|Vizcaya]]) and it was not until the reigns of [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]] and [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] that the Kingdom of Asturias could take effective possession of the territories located south of the [[Cantabrian Mountains]].\n\nFruela I, Alphonse I's son, consolidated and expanded his father's domains. He was assassinated by members of the nobility associated with the House of Cantabria.\n\n== Social and political transformations ==\nWritten sources are concise concerning the reigns of [[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelio]], [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]], [[Mauregatus of Asturias|Mauregatus]] and [[Bermudo I of Asturias|Bermudo I]]. Generally this period, with a duration of twenty-three years (768\u2013791), has been considered as a long stage of obscurity and retreat of the kingdom of Asturias. This version, defended by some historians, who even named this historical phase as that of the \"lazy kings,\" derived from the fact that, during it, there were apparently no important military actions against al-Andalus. However, there were relevant and decisive internal transformations, which provided a foundation for the strengthening and the expansion of Asturias.\n\nFirst, the first internal rebellion, led by Mauregato (783\u2013788), occurred during those years. The rebellion removed Alphonse II from the throne (although he became king again later, from 791 to 842).  This initiated a series of further rebellions whose principal leaders were members of ascending aristocratic palace groups and landowners who, based on the growing economic development of the area, tried to unseat the reigning family of Don Pelayo. The important rebellions of Nepociano, Aldroito and Piniolo, during the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] (842\u201350), are part of this process of economic, social, political and cultural transformation of the Asturian kingdom that occurred during the eighth and ninth centuries.\n\nSecond, neighboring rebellions by [[Basques]] and [[Galicians]] failed, quashed by Asturian kings. These rebels took advantage of the unrest in the central and Eastern part of Asturias, and, on occasion, provided help to one or another contender for the throne: by providing refuge to Alphonse II in [[Alava]] after his flight; the support for Nepociano's rebellion in some Asturian areas; and the adherence of Galicians to the cause of Ramiro I.\n\nFinally, other evidence suggests important internal transformations occurred during this time. Rebellions of [[freedman|freedmen]] (''serbi'', ''servilis orico'' and ''libertini'', according to the ''Chronicles'') occurred during the reign of Aurelio I. The property relationship between master and slave broke down progressively. This fact, together with the growing role of the individual and the restricted family, to the detriment of the extended family, is another indication that a new society was emerging in Asturias at the end of the eighth and beginning of the ninth centuries.\n\n[[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I]] (757\u201368) was succeeded by [[Aurelius of Asturias|Aurelius]] (768\u201374), son of [[Fruela of Cantabria]] and Peter of Cantabria's grandson, who would establish the court in what is today the district of [[San Mart\u00edn del Rey Aurelio]], which previously belonged to Langreo. [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]] (774\u201383) succeeded Aurelio after his death, and transferred the court to [[Pravia]]. Silo was married to [[Adosinda]], one of the daughters of Alphonse I (and therefore, Pelayo's granddaughter).\n\nAlphonse II was elected king after Silo's death, but Mauregato organized a strong opposition and forced the new king to withdraw to lands in Alava (his mother, Munia, was Basque), obtaining the Asturian throne. The king, despite the bad reputation attributed by history, had good relations with [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]], perhaps the most important cultural figure of the kingdom, and supported him in his fight against [[Spanish Adoptionism|adoptionism]]. Legend says that Mauregato was Alphonse I's bastard son with a Moorish woman, and attributes to him the tribute of a hundred maidens. He was succeeded by Bermudo I, Aurelio's brother. He was called \"the deacon\", although he probably received only minor vows. Bermudo abdicated after a military defeat, ending his life in a monastery.\n\n== Recognition and later solidification ==\nIt was not until [[Alfonso II of Asturias|King Alfonso II]] (791\u2013842) that the kingdom was firmly established, after Silo's subjugated [[Gallaecia]] and confirmed territorial gains in western [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710-797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, USA|isbn= 0-631-19405-3|page=165}}</ref> Ties with the Carolingian Franks also got closer and more frequent, with Alfonso II's envoys presenting Charlemagne with spoils of war (campaign of Lisbon, 797).

They were considered authentic by a contemporary pope of Rome. However, during the Asturian period, the final resting place of [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]], located in Oviedo, became the primary religious site and focus of devotion.\n\nAlfonso II also repopulated parts of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Le\u00f3n (historical region)|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and incorporated them into the Kingdom of Asturia while establishing influence over parts of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basques]]. The first capital city was [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], near the site of the battle of Cavadonga. Then in [[Silo of Asturias|Silo's]] time, it was moved to [[Pravia]]. Alfonso II chose his birthplace of [[Oviedo]] as the capital of the kingdom (circa 789).\n\n[[File:Ramiro I Rex.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Ramiro I of Asturias]]]]\nRamiro I began his reign by capturing several other claimants to the throne, blinding them, and then confining them to monasteries. As a warrior he managed to defeat a Viking invasion after the Vikings had landed at Corunna, and also fought several battles against the Moors.\n\n[[File:Alfonso III Leon.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Alfonso III of Asturias]]]]\nWhen he succeeded his father Ramiro, [[Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias|Ordo\u00f1o I]] (850\u201366) repressed a major revolt amongst the Basques in the east of the kingdom. In 859, Ordo\u00f1o besieged the fortress of Albelda, built by [[Musa ibn Musa]] of the [[Banu Qasi]], who had rebelled against Cordoba and became master of Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Toledo. Musa attempted to lift the siege in alliance with his brother-in-law Garc\u00eda I\u00f1iguez, the king of Pamplona, whose small realm was threatened by the eastwards expansion of the Asturian monarchy. In the battle that followed, Musa was defeated and lost valuable treasures in the process, some of which were sent as a gift to Charles the Bald of Francia. Seven days after the victory, Albelda fell and, as the chronicler records, \"its warriors were killed by the sword and the place itself was destroyed down to its foundations.\" Musa was wounded in the battle and died in 862/3; soon thereafter, Musa's son Lubb, governor of Toledo, submitted himself to the Asturian king for the rest of Ordo\u00f1o's reign.\n\nWhen Alfonso III's sons forced his abdication in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (Le\u00f3n and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of Le\u00f3n. It continued under that name until incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]] in 1230, after [[Ferdinand III of Castile|Ferdinand III]] became joint king of the two kingdoms.\n\n== Viking raids ==\nThe [[Vikings]] invaded Galicia in 844, but were decisively defeated by [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]] at [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]].<ref name=Haywood/> Many of the Vikings' casualties were caused by the Galicians' [[ballista]]s \u2013 powerful torsion-powered projectile weapons that looked rather like giant [[crossbow]]s.<ref name=Haywood/><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Brink |editor1-first=Stefan |editor2-last=Price |editor2-first=Neil |title=The Viking World |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> Seventy of the Vikings' [[longship]]s were captured on the beach and burned.<ref name=Haywood>{{cite book |last1=Haywood |first1=John |title=Northmen: The Viking Saga, AD 793\u20131241 |date=2015 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGmoCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT189#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Vikings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Hh0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT207&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oman |first1=Charles |title=England Before the Norman Conquest |date=1924 |isbn=9785878048347 |page=422}}</ref> A few months later, another fleet [[Viking raid on Seville|took Seville]].

A Galician count of Visigothic descent, [[:es:Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez|Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez]], ended the Viking adventure in 971, when he launched an attack with a powerful army that defeated the Vikings in a bloody battle, and captured Gunrod, who was subsequently executed along with his followers.\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== Remnants of Megalithic and Celtic paganism ===\n[[File:Dolmen santa cruz 3.jpg|thumb|left|The Santa Cruz dolmen, burial place of chieftains of the Eastern Asturian area since Megalithic times.]]\n\nAlthough the earliest evidence of Christian worship in Asturias dates from the 5th century, [[evangelism|evangelisation]] did not make any substantial progress until the middle of the sixth century, when hermits like [[Turibius of Li\u00e9bana]] and monks of the Saint Fructuoso order gradually settled in the Cantabrian mountains and began preaching the Christian doctrine.\n\nChristianisation progressed slowly in Asturias and did not necessarily supplant the ancient pagan divinities. As elsewhere in Europe, the new religion coexisted syncretically with features of the ancient beliefs. In the sixth century, bishop San Mart\u00edn de Braga complained in his work ''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'' about the Galician peasants being attached to the pre-Christian cults: \"Many demons, who were expelled from the heavens, settled in the sea, in the rivers, fountains and forests, and have come to be worshipped as gods by ignorant people. To them they do their sacrifices: in the sea they invoke Neptune, in the rivers the Lamias; in the fountains the Nymphs, and in the forests Diana.\"<ref>In Latin: \"Et in mare quidem Neptunum appellant, in fluminibus Lamias, in fontibus Nymphas, in silvis Dianas, quae omnia maligni daemones et spiritus nequam sunt, qui homines infideles, qui signaculo crucis nesciunt se munire, nocent et vexant\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Eibe.jpg|thumb|The [[yew tree]] is still very important in Asturian folklore, where it stands as a link to the [[afterlife]] and is commonly found planted beside churches and cemeteries.]]\nIn the middle of the Sella valley, where [[Cangas de On\u00eds]] is located, there was a dolmen area dating back to the [[megalith|megalithic era]], and was likely built between 4000 and 2000 BC. Chieftains from the surrounding regions were ritually buried here, particularly in the Santa Cruz dolmen. Such practices survived the Roman and Visigothic conquests. Even in the eighth century, King Favila was buried there, along with the bodies of tribal leaders. Although the Asturian monarchy fostered the Christianisation of this site, by constructing a church, to this day there are still pagan traditions linked with the Santa Cruz dolmen. It is said that ''[[xana]]s'' (Asturian fairies) appear to visitors, and magical properties are ascribed to the soil of the place.\n\nAccording to an inscription found in the Santa Cruz church, it was consecrated in 738 and was presided by a ''[[vates]]'' called Asterio. The word ''vates'' is uncommon in Catholic documents and epitaphs, where the word ''presbyterus'' (for Christian priests) is preferred. However, ''vates'' was used in Latin to denote a poet who was clairvoyant, and according to the Ancient Greek writers [[Strabo]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], and [[Posidonius]], the ''vates'' (\u03bf\u03c5\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) were also one of three classes of Celtic priesthood, the other two being the druids and the bards. Some historians think that Asterio held a religious office which combined elements of paganism and Christianity, while others think he may be linked to the Brythonic refugees that settled in [[Britonia]] (Galicia) in the 6th century. The ''Parrochiale Suevorum,'' an administrative document from the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]], states that the lands of Asturias belonged to the Britonian See, and some features of [[Celtic Christianity]] spread to Northern Spain. This is evidenced by the Celtic [[tonsure]], which the Visigothic bishops who participated in the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] condemned.<ref>Marcelino Men\u00e9ndez y Pelayo, \"Historia de los heterodoxos espa\u00f1oles I\", Madrid, 1978, chapter II, note 48</ref>\n\nStill extant Galician legends relate to monks who travelled by sea to the Paradise Islands, like those of [[Saint Amaro]], [[Trezenzonio]] or ''[[The Legend of Ero of Armenteira]]''. These stories have many parallels with those of [[Brendan]] the navigator, [[Malo (saint)|Malo]] of Wales, and the stories of the Irish [[immram]]a.\n\nAsturian kings promoted Christianity and did not base their power on indigenous religious traditions, unlike other medieval European kings such as [[Penda of Mercia]] or [[Widukind]], but on  Christian sacred scriptures (in particular, the books of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]) and the [[Church Fathers]]. These furnished the new monarchy with its foundational myths. They did not need to draft new laws since the [[Visigothic Code]] was the referential code, at least since the arrival of new influences including exiles, prisoners from the central area of al-Andalus in the 770s along with their mixed Berber-Arabic and Gothic legacy. This combined with governmental and religious ideas imported from [[Charlemagne]]'s Frankish Kingdom ([[Alcuin]]-[[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]]).\n\n=== Adoptionism ===\n{{main|Spanish Adoptionism}}\nThe foundations of Asturian culture and that of Christian Spain in the [[High Middle Ages]] were laid during the reigns of [[Silo of Asturias|Silo]] and Mauregatus, when the Asturian kings submitted to the authority of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] emirs of the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. The most prominent Christian scholar in the Kingdom of Asturias of this period was Beatus of Li\u00e9bana, whose works left an indelible mark on the Christian culture of the Reconquista.\n\n[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFolios45v46rWorldMap.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beatus map]].]]\n\nBeatus was directly involved in the debate surrounding adoptionism, which argued that [[Jesus]] was born a man, and was adopted by God and acquired a divine dimension only after his [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and [[resurrection]]. Beatus refuted this theological position, championed by such figures as [[Elipando]], bishop of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].\n\nThe adoptionist theology had its roots in Gothic [[Arianism]], which denied the divinity of Jesus, and in [[Hellenistic religion]], with examples of heroes like [[Heracles]] who, after their death attained the [[apotheosis]]. Likewise, as Elipandus's bishopric of Toledo was at the time within the Muslim Caliphate of Cordoba, Islamic beliefs which acknowledged Jesus as a Prophet, but not as the Son of God, influenced the formation of adoptionism. However, the adoptionist theology was opposed strongly by Beatus from his abbey in [[Santo Toribio de Li\u00e9bana]]. At the same time, Beatus strengthened the links among Asturias, the [[Holy See]], and the [[Carolingian Empire]], and was supported in his theological struggle by the [[Pope]] and by his friend Alcuin of York, an Anglo-Saxon scholar who had settled among the Carolingian court in [[Aachen]].\n\n=== Millennialism ===\n[[File:B Valladolid 120.jpg|thumb|left|''The Angel of the Fifth Trumpet'', an example of a Beatus manuscript.]]\nThe most transcendental works of Beatus were his ''Commentaries to Apocalypse'', which were copied in later centuries in manuscripts called ''beati'', about which the Italian writer [[Umberto Eco]] said: \"Their splendid images gave birth to the most relevant iconographic happening in the History of Mankind\".<ref>Umberto Eco wrote an essay about them, ''Beato di Liebana'' (1976)</ref> Beatus develops in them a personal interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], accompanied by quotes from the [[Old Testament]], the [[Church Fathers]] and fascinating illustrations.\n\nIn these ''Commentaries'' a new interpretation of the apocalyptic accounts is given: [[Babylon]] no longer represents the city of Rome, but C\u00f3rdoba, seat of the Umayyad emirs of al-Andalus; the Beast, once a symbol of the Roman Empire, now stands for the Islamic invaders who during this time threatened to destroy Western Christianity, and who raided territories of the Asturian Kingdom.\n\nThe prologue to the second book of the ''Commentaries'' contains the [[Beatus map]], one of the best examples of a ''[[mappa mundi]]'' of the high medieval culture. The purpose of this map was not to represent the world cartographically, but to illustrate the Apostles' diaspora in the first decades of Christianity. Beatus took data from the works of [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Ptolemy]] and the [[Bible]]. The world was represented as a land disc surrounded by the Ocean and divided in three parts: Asia (upper semicircle), Europe (lower left quadrant) and Africa (lower right quadrant). The Mediterranean Sea (Europe-Africa), the Nile River (Africa-Asia), the Aegean Sea, and the Bosphorus (Europe-Asia) were set as the boundaries between the different continents.\n\nBeatus believed that the [[Apocalypse]] described in the book of Revelation was imminent, which would be followed by 1290 years of domination by the [[Antichrist]]. Beatus followed the views of [[Augustine of Hippo]], whose work, [[the City of God (book)|''The City of God'']], influenced the ''Commentaries'' which followed the premise that the history of the world was structured in six ages. The first five ones extended from the creation of [[Adam]] to the Passion of Jesus, while the sixth, subsequent to Christ, ends with the unleashing of the events prophesied in the book of Revelation.\n[[File:B Facundus 224vd\u00e9t.jpg|thumb|For Beatus of Li\u00e9bana, the [[Whore of Babylon]] (Revelation, 17.4-5)<ref>\"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.\"</ref> (a Christian allegory of evil) was incarnated by the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba.]]\nMillennialist movements were very common in Europe at that time. Between 760 and 780, a series of cosmic phenomena stirred up panic among the population of [[Gaul]]; John, a visionary monk, predicted the coming of the [[Last Judgment]] during the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. In this time  the Apocalypse of Daniel appeared, a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text redacted during the rule of the empress [[Irene of Athens]], wherein wars between the [[Arabs]], the Byzantines and the Northern peoples were prophesied. These wars would end with the coming of the Antichrist.\n\nEvents taking place in Hispania (Islamic rule, the adoptionist heresy, the gradual assimilation of the [[Mozarabs]]) were, for Beatus, signals of the imminent apocalypse. [[aeon]]. As Elipandus describes in his ''Letter from the bishops of Spania to their brothers in Gaul'', the abbot of Santo Toribio went so far as to announce to his countrymen the coming of the End of Time on Easter of the year 800. On the dawn of that day, hundreds of peasants met around the abbey of Santo Toribio, waiting, terrified, for the fulfillment of the prophecy. They remained in there, without eating for a day and half, until one of them, named Ordonius, exclaimed: \"Let us eat and drink, so that if the End of the World comes we are full!\".\n\nThe prophetic and millennialist visions of Beatus produced an enduring mark in the development of the Kingdom of Asturias: the ''Chronica Prophetica'', which was written around 880 CE, predicted the final fall of the Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba, and the conquest and redemption of the entire [[Iberian Peninsula]] by king Alfonso III. Millennialist imagery is also reflected throughout the kingdom in the [[Victory Cross]] icon, the major emblem of the Asturian kingdom, which has its origins in a passage of the Revelation book in which [[John of Patmos]] relates a vision of the [[Second Coming]]. He sees Jesus Christ seated in his majesty, surrounded by clouds and affirming: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty\".<ref>Revelation, 1.8.</ref> It is true that usage of the [[labarum]] was not restricted to Asturias, and dates back to the time of [[Constantine the Great]], who used this symbol during the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]. However, it was in Asturias where the Cruz de la Victoria attained a general use: in nearly every [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|pre-Romanesque]] church this icon is engraved,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.educastur.princast.es/asturias/espacio/150recursos/recursos/imagenes/47.jpg |title=The '&#39;Cruz de la Victoria'&#39; engraved in stone |accessdate=2014-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227170713/http://www.educastur.princast.es/asturias/espacio/150recursos/recursos/imagenes/47.jpg |archive-date=2008-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.comarcavaqueira.com/scripts/museoprerromanico.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208082231/http://www.comarcavaqueira.com/scripts/museoprerromanico.asp |date=February 8, 2012 }}</ref> often accompanied with the expression \"Hoc signo tuetur pius, in hoc signo vincitur inimicus\",<ref>\"With this sign thou shalt defend the pious, with this sign thou shalt defeat the enemy\".</ref> that became the royal motto of the Asturian monarchs.\n\n=== Camino de Santiago ===\nAnother of the major spiritual legacies of the Asturian kingdom is the creation of one of the most important ways of cultural transmission in European history: the [[Camino de Santiago]]. The first text which mentions St. James' preaching in Spain is the ''Breviarius de Hyerosolima'', a 6th-century document which stated that the Apostle was buried in an enigmatic place called ''Aca Marmarica''. Isidore of Seville supported this theory in his work ''De ortu et obitu patrium''. One hundred and fifty years later, in the times of Mauregato, the hymn ''O Dei Verbum'' rendered St. James as \"the golden head of Spain, our protector and national patron\" and a mention is made of his preaching in the Iberian Peninsula during the first decades of Christianity. Some attribute this hymn to Beatus, although this is still discussed by historians.\n\nThe legend of St. James gained support during the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]]. The period was marked by Alfonso II's reaching out to Charlemagne for military assistance and importation of similar royal ceremonies and governmental structures. Galician hermit Pelayo claimed to observe a mysterious brightness during several nights over the wood of Libred\u00f3n, in Iria Flavia diocese. Angelic songs accompanied the lights. Impressed by this phenomenon, Pelayo appeared before the bishop of Iria Flavia, Teodomirus, who \u2013 after having heard the hermit \u2013 visited the location with his retinue. Legend has it that in the depths of the forest was found a stone sepulchre with three corpses, which were identified as those of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James, son of Zebedee]], and his two disciples, Theodorus and Atanasius. According to the legend, King Alfonso was the first pilgrim who had come to see the Apostle.  During his travels he was guided at night by the [[Milky Way]], which from then on acquired the name of ''Camino de Santiago''.\n\nThe founding of the alleged St. James tomb was a formidable political success for the Kingdom of Asturias: Now Asturias could claim the honour of having the body of one of the apostles of Jesus, a privilege shared only with Asia ([[Ephesus]]) where [[John the Apostle]] was buried, and Rome, where the bodies of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] rested. As of the early 12th century, [[Santiago de Compostela#History|Santiago de Compostela]] grew to become one of the three sacred cities of Christianity, together with Rome and [[Jerusalem]]. In later centuries, many Central European cultural influences travelled to Iberia through the Way of St. James, from the Gothic and Romanesque styles, to the Occitan lyric poetry.\n\nHowever, the story of the \"discovery\" of the remains of the Apostle shows some enigmatic features. The tomb was found in a place used as a [[necropolis]] since the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Late Roman Empire]], so it is possible that the body belonged to a prominent person of the area. [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] hypothesized the tomb of Compostela actually hold the remains of [[Priscillian]]. Historian Roger Collins holds that the identification of the relics (at any rate nothing close to a full body) with Saint James is related to the translation of the remains found under a 6th-century church altar in M\u00e9rida, where various saint names are listed, Saint James among them. Other scholars, like Constantino Cabal, highlighted the fact that several Galician places, such as Pico Sacro, Pedra da Barca (Mux\u00eda) or San Andr\u00e9s de Teixido, were already draws for pagan pilgrimage in pre-Roman times. Pagan beliefs held these places as the End of the World and as entrances to the Celtic [[Otherworld]]. After the discovery of Saint James' tomb, the gradual Christianization of those pilgrimage routes began.\n\n=== Mythology ===\n[[File:ErcinaLakeHorse.jpg|thumb|[[Lakes of Covadonga|Ercina lake]], [[Covadonga]]. According to the legend, under its waters a village -or perhaps a city- is hidden.]]\n\nSince the Chronicles of the Asturian kingdom were written a century and a half after the battle of Covadonga, there are many aspects of the first Asturian kings that remain shrouded in myth and legend.\n\nAlthough the historicity of Pelayo is beyond doubt, the historical narrative describing him includes many folktales and legends. One of them asserts that, prior to the Muslim invasion, Pelayo went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the sacred city of Christianity. However, there is no extant evidence of this.\n\nLikewise, it is also said that the ''Cruz de la Victoria'' was at first carved in an oak's log by a lightning strike.<ref>''Simbolog\u00eda m\u00e1gico-tradicional'', Alberto \u00c1lvarez Pe\u00f1a, page 147.</ref> The core of this story contains two elements of major importance in the Asturian folklore. On one hand, lightning was the ancient symbol of the Astur god [[Taranis]], and in Asturian mythology was thought to be forged by the [[Nuberu]], lord of clouds, rain and wind. On the other hand, the oak tree is the symbol of the Asturian royalty and in reliefs of the Abamia Church (where Pelayo was buried) leaves of that tree are shown.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have happened in a shepherd village where today [[Lakes of Covadonga|Lakes Enol and Ercina]] are situated. [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, mother of Jesus]], disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered everything except the cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started to cry, and her tears became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Folio 103v - Hezekiah's Canticle.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of Hezekiah's Canticle belonging to the ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''. The Asturian monarchs often took the kings of the Old Testament as their models.]]\nThere are also myths about the Asturian monarchy that are rooted in Jewish and Christian traditions rather than pagan ones: the ''Chronica ad Sebastianum'' tells of an extraordinary event that happened when Alfonso I died.{{cn|date=March 2020}} While the noblemen were holding a wake for him, there could be heard celestial canticles sung by angels. They recited the following text of the Book of Isaiah (which happens to be the same that was read by the Mozarabic priests during the [[Vigil]] of the [[Holy Saturday]]):\n{{quote|I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.<br/>I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.<br/>Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br/>I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br/>Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.|Is. 38,10-14}}\nThis canticle was recited by [[Hezekiah]], king of Judah, after his recovery from a serious illness. In these verses, the king regretted with distress his departure to [[sheol]], the Jewish underworld, a shady place where he would not see God nor men any more.\n\n[[File:Santa Maria del Naranco.jpg|thumb|Church of [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco]]. Eastern fa\u00e7ade. This is probably the finest example of Asturian architecture.]] \nAsturias also has examples of the [[king in the mountain]] myth. According to the tradition, it is still today possible to see king [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] walking around the ''Jard\u00edn de los Reyes Caudillos''<ref>''Relatos legendarios sobre los or\u00edgenes pol\u00edticos de Asturias y Vizcaya en la Edad Media'', Arsenio F.

The story tells that one day a peasant went into a certain cave to retrieve his lost cow and heard a strong voice who declared to be Bernardo del Carpio, victor over the Franks in [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass|Roncevaux]].<ref>In medieval Spain, it was commonly thought that it was the Asturians or the Moors, and not the Basques, who beat the Franks in this battle.</ref> After saying he had lived alone for centuries in that cave, he told the peasant: \"Give me your hand, so that I can see how strong are men today\". The shepherd, scared, gave him the horn of the cow, which, when seized by the giant man, was immediately broken.

These people had already fought the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the [[Cantabrian Wars]], and initially resisted [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]]. Although they preserved many characteristics of their pre-Roman culture, their [[Celtic languages]] were later lost in favor of [[Latin]].\n\nThis kingdom is the birthplace of an influential European [[medieval architecture|medieval architectural style]]: Asturian pre-Romanesque. This style of architecture was founded during the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro I]].\n\nThis small kingdom was a milestone in the fight against the adoptionist heresy, with Beatus of Li\u00e9bana as a major figure. In the time of Alfonso II, the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]] was \"found.\" The pilgrimage to Santiago, Cami\u00f1o de Santiago, was a major nexus within Europe, and many pilgrims (and their money) passed through Asturias on their way to Santiago de Compostela.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Asturian art]]\n*[[Autonomous communities in Spain|Autonomous community]] of [[Asturias]].\n*[[List of Asturian monarchs]]\n**[[List of Asturian monarchs#Family tree|Monarchs' family tree]]\n*[[Reconquista]]\n*[[Timeline of the Muslim occupation of the Iberian Peninsula]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|last=Glick| first=Thomas |title=Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages|publisher=Brill|location =Leiden |year=2005 |isbn=90-04-14771-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWqmebvcjj0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}\n\n{{Commons category}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.mirabiliaovetensia.com Information and virtual reconstructions of early monuments of Oviedo]\n\n{{Monarchs of Asturias}}\n{{Asturian Art|state=collapsed}}\n{{Spanish Kingdoms |state=collapsed}}\n{{Asturias topics}}\n\n{{coord|43|21|45|N|5|50|35|W|source:kolossus-itwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kingdom Of Asturias}}\n[[Category:Kingdom of Asturias| ]]\n[[Category:History of Asturias]]\n[[Category:Medieval Portugal]]\n[[Category:Medieval Spain]]\n[[Category:Former countries on the Iberian Peninsula|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Spanish history|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Former kingdoms|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Europe|Asturias]]\n[[Category:History of Al-Andalus]]\n[[Category:History of Portugal by polity|Asturias]]\n[[Category:Pelagius of Asturias]]\n[[Category:Reconquista]]\n[[Category:8th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:8th century in Spain]]\n[[Category:9th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:9th century in Spain]]\n[[Category:10th century in Portugal]]\n[[Category:10th century in Spain]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in the 710s]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in the 920s]]\n[[Category:718 establishments]]\n[[Category:924 disestablishments]]\n<!---[[Category:8th-century establishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:8th-century establishments in Spain]]--->\n<!---[[Category:10th-century disestablishments in Portugal]]\n[[Category:10th-century disestablishments in Spain]]--->\n", "name_user": "Richardkiwi", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:Covadonga, conjunto paisaj\u00edstico, Pelayo (cropped) (cropped).jpg\u2192File:Estatua de Don Pelayo en Covadonga, Asturias.jpgCriterion 6(maintenance or bug fix)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Asturias"}

Fought near [[Covadonga]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] Mountains, either in 718 or 722,<ref name=\"Remensnyder23\" /> it reportedly resulted in a victory for the Christian forces led by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]]. The Christian victory, whose actual existence has been disputed, was supposed to be central to the consolidation of an independent Christian polity (controlled by either Visigothic elites, local elites, or an alliance between the former two) that grew into the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. As a result, the Battle of Covadonga has been metahistorically reconstructed as the initial point of the \"''{{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}''\" (\"reconquest\") of Christian rule to the entire peninsula,<ref>Ring, Trudy, Robert M. Salkin and Sharon La Boda, ''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe'', (Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1995), 170.</ref> after the [[Islamic conquest of Hispania]] in 711\u2013718.\n\n==Prelude==\nAccording to texts written by [[Mozarabs]] in northern Iberia during the late ninth century, the [[Visigoths]] in AD 718 elected a nobleman named [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], (681\u2013737) as their ''princeps'', or leader. Pelagius (''Don Pelayo'' in Spanish), the first monarch of the Asturian Kingdom, was a grandson of a former king of [[Hispania]], [[Chindasuinth]], and son of Favila, who had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King [[Egica]] (687\u2013700), established his headquarters at [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], [[Asturias]] and incited an uprising against the [[Umayyad]] Muslims.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Muslim invasion of Iberia, refugees and combatants from the south of the peninsula had been moving north to avoid Islamic authority. Some had taken refuge in the remote mountains of [[Asturias]] in the northwestern part of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. There, from among the dispossessed of the south, Pelagius recruited his band of fighters. His first acts were to refuse to pay the [[Jizya]] (tax on non-Muslims) to the Muslims any longer and to assault the small Umayyad garrisons that had been stationed in the area. Eventually, he managed to expel a provincial governor named [[Munuza]] from [[Asturias]]. He held the territory against a number of attempts to re-establish Muslim control, and soon founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], which became a Christian stronghold against further Muslim expansion.\n\nFor the first few years, this rebellion posed no threat to the new masters of Hispania, whose seat of power had been established at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. Consequently, there was only a minor perfunctory reaction. Pelagius was not always able to keep the Muslims out of Asturias but neither could they defeat him, and as soon as the Moors left, he would always re-establish control. Islamic forces were focused on raiding [[Narbonne]] and [[Gaul]], and there was a shortage of manpower for putting down an inconsequential insurrection in the mountains. Pelagius never attempted to force the issue, and it was an Umayyad defeat elsewhere that probably set the stage for the Battle of Covadonga. On July 9, 721, a Muslim force that had crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and invaded the Kingdom of the [[Franks]] was defeated by them in the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]], in present-day France. This was the first serious setback in the Muslim campaign in southwestern Europe. Reluctant to return to C\u00f3rdoba with such unalloyed bad news, the [[Ummayad]] [[w\u0101li]], [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]], decided that putting down the rebellion in Asturias on his way home would afford his troops an easy victory and raise their flagging morale.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:The Battle of Covadonga.jpg|thumb|King Pelayo at the Battle of Covadonga]]\nIn 722, forces commanded by the Umayyad commanders [[Al Qama]] and [[Munuza]], and (according to legend) accompanied by Bishop [[Oppas]]<ref>Archer, Thomas Andrew and Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, ''The Story of the Crusades'', (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1895), 25.</ref> of Seville, were sent to Asturias. As Al Qama overran much of the region, folklore<ref>\"Spain: The Northern Kingdoms and the Basques, by Roger Collins.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History. Ed. Rosamond McKitterick. Vol. II. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995. Print.</ref> suggests that Oppas attempted to broker the surrender of his fellow Christians, but he failed in the effort. Pelagius and his force retreated deep into the mountains of Asturias, eventually retiring into a narrow valley flanked by mountains, which was easily defensible due to the impossibility of launching a broad-fronted attack. Pelagius may have had as few as three hundred men with him.\n\nAl Qama eventually arrived at Covadonga, and sent forward an envoy to convince Pelagius to surrender. He refused, so Al Qama ordered his best troops into the valley to fight. The Asturians shot arrows and stones from the slopes of the mountains, and then, at the climactic moment, Pelagius personally led some of his soldiers out into the valley. They had been hiding in a cave, unseen by the Muslims. The Christian accounts of the battle claim that the slaughter among the Muslims was horrific, while Umayyad accounts describe it as a mere skirmish. Al Qama himself fell in the battle, and his soldiers withdrew from the battlefield.\n\nIn the aftermath of Pelagius' victory, the people of the conquered villages of Asturias now emerged with their weapons, and killed hundreds of Al Qama's retreating troops. Munuza, learning of the defeat, organized another force, and gathered what was left of the survivors of Covadonga. At some later date, he confronted Pelagius and his now greatly augmented force, near the modern town of [[Proaza]]. Again Pelagius won, and Munuza was killed in the fighting. The battle is commemorated at the shrine of [[Our Lady of Covadonga]].\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Christianity|War}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Covadonga 722}}\n[[Category:720s conflicts]]\n[[Category:722]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Kingdom of Asturias|Covadonga]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Reconquista]]\n[[Category:8th century in Al-Andalus]]\n[[Category:Pelagius of Asturias]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Battle of Covadonga\n| partof      = the ''[[Reconquista]]''\n| image       = Covadonga, conjunto paisaj\u00edstico, Pelayo (cropped) (cropped).jpg\n| image_size  = 300px\n| caption     = Pelagius, victor at Covadonga and first King of Asturias.\n| date        = Summer of 718 or 722 AD<ref name=\"Remensnyder23\">Amy G.

{"title_page": "History of Portugal", "text_new": "{{short description|History of Portugal}}\n{{redirects|Portuguese history|the history of the Portuguese language|History of Portuguese}}\n{{History of Portugal}}\n\nThe '''history of Portugal''' can be traced from circa 400,000 years ago, when the region of present-day [[Portugal]] was inhabited by [[Homo heidelbergensis]]. The oldest human fossil is the skull discovered in the [[Cave of Aroeira]] in [[Almonda]]. Later [[Neanderthal]]s roamed the northern Iberian peninsula. [[Homo sapiens]] arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago.\n\nPre-Celtic tribes such as [[Lusitanians]], [[Turduli]] and [[Oestriminis]] lived in the centre and north. In the south the [[Cynetes]] lived in the Algarve and Lower Alentejo regions before the 6th century BC, developed the city of [[Tartessos]] and the written [[Tartessian language]], and left many [[stelae]] in the south of the country. Early in the first millennium BC, waves of [[Celts]] from [[Central Europe]] invaded and intermarried with the local populations to form several ethnic groups and many tribes. \nTheir presence is traceable, in broad outline, through archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated the northern and central area, while the south retained much of its [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] character, combined with the [[Celtici]] until the Roman conquest. Some small, semi-permanent trading settlements were founded by Phoenician-Carthaginians on the southern coast of the Algarve.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion in the 3rd century BC lasted several centuries, and developed the Roman provinces of [[Lusitania]] in the south and [[Gallaecia]] in the north. Numerous Roman sites include works of engineering, baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, layman's homes, coins, sarcophagi, and ceramics. As elsewhere in [[Western Europe]], there was a sharp decline in urban life during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] following the fall of Rome. \nGermanic tribes (that the Romans referred to as [[Barbarian]]s) controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries. These included the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] centred in Braga and the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in the south. Eventually the Visigoths seized power in the whole of Iberia.\nUnder the [[Visigoths]] a new class emerged, a [[nobility]], which played a tremendous social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Church also began to play a very important part within the state, but since the Visigoths did not know Latin the Catholic bishops continued the Roman system of governance. The [[clergy]] started to emerge as a high-ranking class.\n\nIn 711-716 an invasion by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate, comprising Berbers from North Africa and Arabs from the Middle East plus other Muslims from all around the Islamic world, conquered the Visigoth Kingdom and founded the Islamic State of Al Andalus. The Umayyads reigned supreme and advanced through Iberia and France until the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and endured in the south until the final reconquista of the [[Algarve]]([[Gharb Al-Andalus]]) in 1294. \nLisbon and the rest of what would become Portugal, was reconquered by the early 12th century. At the end of the 9th century, a county based in the area of [[Portus Cale]] was established under King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], and by the 10th century, the Counts were known as the ''Magnus Dux Portucalensium'' (Grand Duke of the Portuguese). (''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', ''Portugalli\u00e6'') The [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was later divided so that northern \"Portugal\" became part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]].\n\nInitially a vassal of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, Portugal grew in power and territory and gained ''de facto'' independence during weak Leonese reigns. In 1071 Garcia II of Galicia was declared [[King of Portugal]] and in 1095, Portugal broke away from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. At the end of the 11th century, the Burgundian knight [[Henry, count of Portugal|Henry]] became count of Portugal and defended its independence by merging the [[County of Portugal]] and the [[County of Coimbra]]. Henry's son [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] proclaimed himself ''Prince of Portugal'' on 24 June 1128 and King of Portugal in 1139 with Guimar\u00e3es (Vimarens) as capital. In 1179 a papal bull officially recognised Afonso I as king. The Algarve was conquered from the [[Moors]] in 1249, and in 1255 [[Lisbon]] became the capital. Portugal's land boundaries have remained almost unchanged since then. \n\nDuring the reign of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], the Portuguese defeated the [[Castilians]] in a war over the throne (1385) and established a political alliance with [[Kingdom of England|England]] (by the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386) that has endured and continued to the present day. This is the world\u2019s oldest military agreement between two sovereign nations.\n\nFrom the late [[Middle Ages]], in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Portugal]] ascended to the status of a [[Great power|world power]] during Europe's \"[[Age of Discovery]]\" as it [[Portuguese Empire|built up a vast empire]], including possessions in South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Over the following two centuries, Portugal kept most of its colonies, but gradually lost much of its wealth and status as the Dutch, English, and French took an increasing share of the [[Spice trade|spice]] and [[History of slavery|slave trades]] by surrounding or conquering the widely scattered Portuguese trading posts and territories. Signs of military decline began with two disastrous battles: the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in Morocco in 1578 and Spain's abortive attempt to conquer England in 1588 by means of the [[Spanish Armada]] \u2013 Portugal was then in an uncomfortable [[Iberian Union|dynastic union with Spain]] and contributed ships to the Spanish invasion fleet. The country was further weakened by the destruction of much of its capital city in an [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake in 1755]], occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the loss of its largest colony, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], in 1822. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two\nmillion [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] left Portugal to live in Brazil and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=77 |title=Portugal Seeks Balance of Emigration, Immigration |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date=2002-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, there was a revolution that deposed the monarchy. Amid corruption, repression of the church, and the near-bankruptcy of the state, a military coup in 1926 installed a dictatorship that remained until another coup in 1974. The new government instituted sweeping [[democracy|democratic]] reforms and granted independence to all of Portugal's African colonies in 1975. Portugal is a founding member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). It entered the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1986.\n\n== Etymology ==<!--linked-->\n\nThe word Portugal derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name '''''[[Portus Cale]]'''''. Cale or [[Cailleach]] was the name of a Celtic deity<ref>Cale, the mother goddess of the Celtic people, the one who armed with a hammer formed mountains and valleys. She hides in the rocks. She is Mother Nature. Her other name is Cailleach (Gallaecia/Galiza)</ref> and the name of an early settlement located at the mouth of the [[Douro River]] (present-day [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]), which flows into the Atlantic Ocean in the north of what is now Portugal. Around 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Carthaginians during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale and renamed it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale''). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''.\n\nThe name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and [[Minho River|Minho]], the Minho flowing along what would become the northern [[Portugal-Spain border]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\nThe etymology of ''Cale'' points to Cale<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA160&dq=lisbon+etymology#PPA55,M1 |title=Local etymology: a derivative ... \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2010-08-22|year=1859|last1=Charnock |first1=Richard Stephen }}</ref> being a [[Celts|Celtic]] name, like many others found in the region.

And ''[[port wine|port]]'' became the English name of the wine actually produced further inland, in the Upper Douro Valley region, but exported through Porto.

The Celtic presence in Portugal is traceable, in broad outline, through archaeological and linguistic evidence.

From that time, the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was unified under a [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref name=\"books.google\" />\n\nWith the Visigoths settled in the newly formed kingdom, a new class emerged that had been unknown in Roman times: a [[nobility]], which played a tremendous social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was also under the [[Visigoths]] that the Church began to play a very important part within the state. Since the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on Catholic bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws established during the Visigothic monarchy were thus made by councils of bishops, and the [[clergy]] started to emerge as a high-ranking class.\n\n== Al Andalus (711\u2013868) ==\n{{Main|Al-Andalus}}\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 750-en.svg|thumb|Portugal part of [[Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus Province]] of [[Ummayad caliphate]] in 750.]]\n\nDuring the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph [[Al-Walid I]], the Berber commander [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] led a small force that landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April 711, ostensibly to intervene in a [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] civil war.

With the Reconquista, new artistic trends took hold, with Galician-Asturian influences more visible than the Leonese. The Portuguese group was characterized by a general return to classicism.

In 1143, the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n recognised him as King of Portugal by the [[Treaty of Zamora]].

Since early times, fishing and overseas commerce have been the main economic activities.\n\n== Naval exploration and Portuguese Empire (15th\u201316th centuries) ==\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1415\u20131578)|Portuguese Empire}}\n\n[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|500px|Portuguese discoveries and explorations: first arrival places and dates; main Portuguese [[spice trade]] routes in the [[Indian Ocean]] (blue); territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]] under [[King John III of Portugal|King John III]] rule (1521\u20131557) (green). The [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|disputed discovery of Australia]] is not shown.]]\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal became a leading European power that ranked with [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] in terms of economic, political and cultural influence. Though not dominant in European affairs, Portugal did have an extensive colonial trading empire throughout the world backed by a powerful [[thalassocracy]].\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Portuguese Empire]] can be traced to 25 July 1415, when the Portuguese [[wikt:armada#Portuguese|Armada]] set sail for the rich [[Islamic]] trading center of [[Ceuta]] in [[North Africa]]. The Armada was accompanied by King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], his sons Prince [[Duarte of Portugal|Duarte]] (a future king), Prince [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Pedro]], and Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], and the legendary Portuguese hero [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> On 21 August 1415, [[Conquest of Ceuta|Ceuta was conquered by Portugal]], and the long-lived Portuguese Empire was founded.<ref name=\"Livermore_108\">{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=108}}</ref>\n\nThe conquest of Ceuta was facilitated by a major civil war that had been engaging the Muslims of the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa) since 1411.<ref name=\"Livermore_108\" /> This civil war prevented a re-capture of Ceuta from the Portuguese, when the king of [[Granada]] [[Muhammed IX, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed IX]], the Left-Handed, laid siege to Ceuta and attempted to coordinate forces in Morocco and attract aid and assistance for the effort from Tunis.<ref name=\"Livermore_109\">{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=109}}</ref> The Muslim attempt to retake Ceuta was ultimately unsuccessful and Ceuta remained the first part of the new Portuguese Empire.<ref name=\"Livermore_109\" /> Further steps were taken that would soon expand the Portuguese Empire much further.\n\nIn 1418, two of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]'s captains, [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] and [[Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to an island that they called [[Porto Santo island|Porto Santo]] (\"Holy Port\") in gratitude for their rescue from the shipwreck. In 1419, [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] disembarked on the [[Madeira Island|Island of Madeira]]. Uninhabited Madeira was colonized by the Portuguese in 1420.<ref name=\"Livermore_109\" />\n\nBetween 1427 and 1431, most of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] were discovered and these uninhabited islands were colonized by the Portuguese in 1445. Portuguese expeditions may have attempted to colonize the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canary Islands]] as early as 1336, but the [[Crown of Castile]] objected to any Portuguese claim to them. Castile began its own conquest of the Canaries in 1402. Castile expelled the last Portuguese from the Canary islands in 1459, and they would eventually become part of the Spanish Empire.<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=249}}</ref>\n\nIn 1434, [[Gil Eanes]] passed [[Cape Bojador]], south of [[Morocco]]. The trip marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of [[Africa]]. Before this event, very little was known in Europe about what lay beyond the cape. At the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, those who tried to venture there became lost, which gave birth to legends of [[sea monster]]s. Some setbacks occurred: in 1436 the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canaries]] were officially recognized as Castilian by the pope\u2014earlier they had been recognized as Portuguese; in 1438, the Portuguese were defeated in a military expedition to [[History of Tangier|Tangier]].\n\nThese setbacks did not deter the Portuguese from pursuing their exploratory efforts. In 1448, on the small island of [[Arguim]] off the coast of [[Mauritania]], an important castle was built to function as a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'', or trading post, for commerce with inland Africa. Some years before, the first African [[gold]] was brought to Portugal that circumvented the Arab caravans that crossed the Sahara. Some time later, the [[caravel]]s explored the [[Gulf of Guinea]], which led to the discovery of several uninhabited islands: [[Cape Verde]], [[Fernando P\u00f3o (island)|Fern\u00e3o P\u00f3o]], [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]], [[Principe Island|Pr\u00edncipe]] and [[Annob\u00f3n]].<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=248}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 November 1460, Prince Henry the Navigator died.<ref name=\"Hallett_164\">{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=164}}</ref> He had been the leading patron of maritime exploration by Portugal and immediately following his death, exploration lapsed. Henry's patronage had shown that profits could be made from the trade that followed the discovery of new lands. Accordingly, when exploration commenced again, private merchants led the way in attempting to stretch trade routes further down the African coast.<ref name=\"Hallett_164\" />\n\nIn the 1470s, Portuguese trading ships reached the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]].<ref name=\"Hallett_164\" /> In 1471, the Portuguese captured Tangier, after years of attempts. Eleven years later, the fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] in the town of [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea was built. [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail aboard the fleet of ships taking materials and building crews to Elmina in December 1481. In 1483, [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] reached and explored the [[Congo River]].\n\n=== Discovery of the sea route to India and the Treaty of Tordesillas ===\n[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Vasco da Gama landing in [[Kerala, India]].]]\nIn 1484, Portugal officially rejected Columbus' idea of reaching [[India]] from the west, because it was seen as unfeasible. Some historians have claimed that the Portuguese had already performed fairly accurate calculations concerning the size of the world and therefore knew that sailing west to reach the Indies would require a far longer journey than navigating to the east. However, this continues to be debated. Thus began a long-lasting dispute that eventually resulted in the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Castile in 1494. The treaty divided the (largely undiscovered) [[New World]] equally between the Portuguese and the Castilians, along a north\u2013south [[prime meridian|meridian line]] 370 leagues (1770&nbsp;km/1100 miles) west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands, with all lands to the east belonging to Portugal and all lands to the west to Castile.\n\n[[File:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Brazil issued by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]\nWith the expedition beyond the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1487,<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=129}}</ref> the richness of [[India]] was now accessible. Indeed, the cape takes its name from the promise of rich trade with the east. Between 1498 and 1501, [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] explored [[North America]]. At the same time, [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] reached [[Ethiopia]] by land. [[Vasco da Gama]] sailed for India and arrived at [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] on 20 May 1498, returning in glory to Portugal the next year.<ref name=\"Hallett_164\" /> The [[Monastery of Jer\u00f3nimos]] was built, dedicated to the discovery of the route to India.\n\nAt the end of the 15th century, Portugal [[Expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Portugal|expelled]] some local [[Sephardim|Sephardic Jews]], along with those refugees who had come from [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] after 1492. In addition, many Jews were forcibly converted to Catholicism and remained as ''[[converso]]s''. Many Jews remained [[Crypto-Jew|secretly Jewish]], in danger of persecution by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]].

This was the coast of what would later become the Portuguese colony of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]].<ref name=\"Livermore_138_139\" />\n\nThe real goal of the expedition, however, was to open sea trade to the empires of the east. Trade with the east had effectively been cut off since the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453. Accordingly, Cabral turned away from exploring the coast of the new land of Brazil and sailed southeast, back across the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope. Cabral reached [[Sofala]] on the east coast of Africa in July 1500.<ref name=\"Livermore_138_139\" /> In 1505, a Portuguese fort was established here and the land around the fort would later become the [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese colony of Mozambique]].<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=217}}</ref>\n\nCabral's fleet then sailed east and landed in [[Calicut]] in [[India]] in September 1500.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=139}}</ref> Here they traded for pepper and, more significantly, opened European sea trade with the empires of the east. No longer would the Muslim [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of [[Constantinople]] form a barrier between Europe and the east. Ten years later, in 1510, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], after attempting and failing to capture and occupy [[Zamorin]]'s Calicut militarily, conquered [[Goa]] on the west coast of India.<ref>[[Percival Spear]], India: A Modern History (University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1961) pp. 162\u2013163.</ref>\n\n[[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] discovered [[Ascension Island]] in 1501 and [[Saint Helena]] in 1502; [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] was the first to sight the archipelago still known by his name in 1506. In 1505, [[Francisco de Almeida]] was engaged to improve Portuguese trade with the far east. Accordingly, he sailed to East Africa. Several small Islamic states along the coast of [[Mozambique]]\u2014[[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]], [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Mombasa]]\u2014were destroyed or became subjects or allies of Portugal.<ref name=\"Livermore_140\">{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=140}}</ref> Almeida then sailed on to [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]], made peace with the ruler and built a stone fort there.<ref name=\"Livermore_140\" />\n\n[[File:Portuguese arrival in Japan.jpg|thumb|The arrival of the Portuguese in [[Japan]], the first Europeans who managed to reach it, initiating the ''[[Nanban trade|Nanban]]'' (\"southern barbarian\") period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.]]\n\n==== Portuguese Empire ====\n{{Further|Portuguese Empire}}\n\nBy the 16th century, the two million people who lived in the original Portuguese lands ruled a vast empire with many millions of inhabitants in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. From 1514, the Portuguese had reached [[China]] and [[Japan]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Arabian Sea]], one of Cabral's ships discovered [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] (1507); [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506, and in the same year, [[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]] visited [[Ceylon]].\n\nIn the [[Red Sea]], [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama (16th century)|Estev\u00e3o da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]]. [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]], in the [[Persian Gulf]], was seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1515, who also entered into diplomatic relations with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1521, a force under [[Ant\u00f3nio Correia (admiral)|Antonio Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]] and ushered in a period of almost 80 years of Portuguese rule of the Persian Gulf archipelago<ref>Juan Cole, Sacred Space and Holy War, IB Tauris, 2007 p. 37</ref>\n[[File:Ferdinand Magellan.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand Magellan ([[Fern\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es]])]]\nOn the Asiatic mainland, the first trading stations were established by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] at Cochin and Calicut (1501).

In late August, the Duke of Alba defeated Ant\u00f3nio's force, a ragtag army assembled in a hurry and composed mainly of local peasants, and freed slaves at the [[Battle of Alc\u00e2ntara (1580)|Battle of Alc\u00e2ntara]].<ref>Tony Jaques, ''Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A\u2013E, 2007'' p. 25</ref> This battle ended in a decisive victory for the Spanish army, both on land and sea.

From 1595 to 1663, the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]] led to invasions of many countries in Asia and competition for commercial interests in Japan, Africa and South America.

Beginning with a major Spanish\u2013Portuguese military operation in 1625, this trend was reversed, and it laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch-controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would re-establish its authority over some lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].\n\n== Portuguese Restoration War (1640\u20131668) ==\n{{Main|Portuguese Restoration War}}\n[[File:Portrait of John, Duke of Braganza c. 1630 (The Royal Castle in Warsaw).png|thumb|John IV of Portugal]]\nAt home, life was calm and serene under the first two Spanish kings, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. They maintained Portugal's status, gave excellent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish [[Noble court|courts]], and Portugal maintained an independent law, currency and government. It was even proposed to move the Spanish capital to [[Lisbon]]. Later, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles lost power.\n\nBecause of this, as well as the general strain on the finances of the Spanish throne as a result of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Braganza]], one of the great native noblemen and a descendant of King Manuel I, was proclaimed King of Portugal as [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] on 1 December 1640, and a war of independence against Spain was launched. The governors of [[History of Ceuta|Ceuta]] did not accept the new king; rather, they maintained their allegiance to Philip IV and Spain.\n\nIn the 17th century, many Portuguese emigrated to Brazil. From 1709, [[John V of Portugal|John V]] prohibited emigration, since Portugal had lost a sizable proportion of its population.

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Maria Anna of Austria]], was fond of De Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]] however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year, and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the Maria Anna's approval, he appointed Melo as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. As the king's confidence in de Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state.\n\nBy 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made [[prime-minister]]. Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]]; and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal.\n\n[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbor.]]\nBut Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and [[guilds]] to regulate every [[commerce|commercial]] activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law on all classes of Portuguese society, from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\nDisaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon was struck by a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] magnitude of 9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent [[tsunami]] and fires. De Melo survived by a stroke of luck and immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: \"What now? We bury the dead and feed the living.\"\n\nDespite the natural disaster, Lisbon\u2019s population suffered no epidemics and within less than one year the city was being rebuilt. The new Lisbon downtown was designed to resist subsequent [[earthquakes]]. [[Architectural]][[Scale model|models]] were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were [[simulated]] by marching troops around the models.

As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the Duke of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the minister against his enemies. Based upon his swift resolve, Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment\" and economic progress, while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, furthering [[colonial exploitation]], intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u2013162.</ref>\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis (See ''[[T\u00e1vora affair]]''), and forbade him from coming within 20 miles of her, thus curtailing his influence.\n\n=== Portuguese-led invasion of Spain in 1707 ===\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n\nIn 1707, as part of the War of the Spanish Succession, a joint Portuguese, Dutch, and [[United Kingdom|British]] army, led by the Marquis of Minas, [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa, 2nd Marquis of Minas|Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa]], conquered Madrid and acclaimed the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]] as King Charles III of Spain. Along the route to Madrid, the army led by the Marquis of Minas was successful in conquering [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and [[Salamanca]]. Later in the following year, Madrid was reconquered by Spanish troops loyal to the Bourbons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqnet.pt/portal/pessoais/castelobramco_comentarios.html|title=O Portal da Hist\u00f3ria \u2013 Mem\u00f3rias: Ant\u00f3nio do Couto Castelo Branco em 1707|author=|date=|website=www.arqnet.pt|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Ghost War'' ===\n{{Main|Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)}}\nIn 1762 [[France]] and Spain tried to urge Portugal to join the [[Bourbon Family Compact]] by claiming that Great Britain had become too powerful due to its successes in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Joseph refused to accept and maintained that his 1704 alliance with [[Great Britain|Britain]] was no threat.\n\nIn spring 1762, Spanish and French troops invaded Portugal from the north as far as the [[Douro]], while a second column sponsored the [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|Siege of Almeida]], captured the city, and threatened to advance on Lisbon. The arrival of a force of British troops helped the Portuguese army commanded by the [[William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe|Count of Lippe]] by blocking the Franco-Spanish advance and driving them back across the border following the [[Battle of Valencia de Alc\u00e1ntara]]. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, Spain agreed to hand Almeida back to Portugal.\n\n== Crises of the nineteenth century ==\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\nIn 1807, Portugal refused [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s demand to accede to the [[Continental System]] of embargo against the United Kingdom; a French invasion under [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]] followed, and Lisbon was captured on 8 December 1807. British intervention in the [[Peninsular War]] helped in maintaining Portuguese independence; the last French troops were expelled in 1812. The war cost Portugal the town of [[Olivenza|Oliven\u00e7a]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Ertl|first=Alan W.|title=Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Precis of Continental Integration|year=2008|publisher=Dissertation.com|isbn=978-1-59942-983-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&pg=PA303&dq=province+Oliven%C3%A7a+peninsular+war#v=onepage&q=province%20Oliven%C3%A7a%20peninsular%20war&f=false|page=303}}</ref> now governed by Spain.\n\n[[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil was the Portuguese capital between 1808 and 1821. In 1820, [[constitutionalist]] insurrections took place at [[Porto]] (24 August) and Lisbon (15 September). Lisbon regained its status as the capital of Portugal when Brazil declared its independence from Portugal in 1822.\n\nThe death of King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, [[Pedro I of Brazil]], briefly became [[Pedro IV of Portugal]], but neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his 7-year-old daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria da Gl\u00f3ria]], on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel]]. Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the \"absolutist\" faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the [[Liberal Wars]] in which Pedro eventually forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on throne as Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]].\n\nThe [[1890 British Ultimatum]] was delivered to Portugal on 11 January of that year, an attempt to force the retreat of Portuguese military forces in the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]). The area had been claimed by Portugal, which included it in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", but this clashed with British aspirations to create a railroad link between [[Cairo]] and [[Cape Town]], thereby linking its colonies from the north of Africa to the very south. This diplomatic clash lead to several waves of protest and prompted the downfall of the Portuguese government. The 1890 British Ultimatum was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the British against her oldest ally.<ref>Jo\u00e3o Ferreira Duarte, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/2000/v13/n1/037395ar.pdf The Politics of Non-Translation: A Case Study in Anglo-Portuguese Relations]</ref>\n\nAfter 1815, the Portuguese expanded their trading ports along the African coast, moving inland to take control of Angola and Mozambique. The slave trade was abolished in 1836, in part because many foreign slave ships were flying the Portuguese flag. In [[Portuguese India]], trade flourished in the colony of [[History of Goa|Goa]], with its subsidiary colonies of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], near Hong Kong on the China coast, and [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]], north of Australia. The Portuguese successfully introduced Catholicism and the Portuguese language into their colonies, while most settlers continued to head to Brazil.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=299\u2013306}}</ref><ref>Gervase Clarence-Smith, ''The Third Portuguese Empire, 1825\u20131975: A Study in Economic Imperialism'' (1985)</ref>\n\n== The First Republic (1910\u20131926) ==\n{{Main|First Portuguese Republic}}\n\nThe First Republic has, over the course of the recent past, been neglected by many historians in favor of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''. As a result, it is difficult to attempt a global synthesis of the republican period in view of the important gaps that still persist in our knowledge of its political history. As far as the [[5 October 1910 Revolution]] is concerned, a number of valuable studies have been made,<ref>Wheeler, 1972</ref> first among which ranks Vasco Pulido Valente's polemical thesis. This historian posited the [[Jacobin]] and urban nature of the revolution carried out by the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] (PRP) and claimed that the PRP had turned the republican regime into a de facto dictatorship.<ref>Pulido Valente, 1982</ref> This vision clashes with an older interpretation of the First Republic as a progressive and increasingly democratic regime that presented a clear contrast to [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]]'s ensuing dictatorship.<ref>Oliveira Marques, 1991</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. It was secularist and followed the liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role that the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, \"The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualistic middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.\"<ref>Payne, ''A history of Spain and Portugal'' (1973) 2: 559</ref> Under the leadership of [[Afonso Costa]], the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 October\u2014five days after the inauguration of the Republic\u2014the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship.\n\nA series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by [[Afonso Costa]] culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911.\n\n=== Constitution ===\nA republican constitution was approved in 1911, inaugurating a parliamentary regime with reduced presidential powers and two chambers of parliament.<ref>Miranda, 2001</ref> The Republic provoked important fractures within Portuguese society, notably among the essentially monarchist rural population, in the trade unions, and in the Church. Even the PRP had to endure the secession of its more moderate elements, who formed conservative republican parties like the [[Portuguese Evolutionist Party|Evolutionist Party]] and the [[Uni\u00e3o Republicana|Republican Union]]. In spite of these splits, the PRP, led by [[Afonso Costa]], preserved its dominance, largely due to a brand of clientelist politics inherited from the monarchy.<ref name=\"Lopes, 1994\">Lopes, 1994</ref> In view of these tactics, a number of opposition forces were forced to resort to violence in order to enjoy the fruits of power. There are few recent studies of this period of the Republic's existence, known as the \u2018old\u2019 Republic. Nevertheless, an essay by Vasco Pulido Valente should be consulted (1997a), as should the attempt to establish the political, social, and economic context made by M. Villaverde Cabral (1988).\n\nThe PRP viewed the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the African colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime and even around the party.<ref>Teixeira, 1996a</ref> These domestic objectives were not met, since participation in the conflict was not the subject of a national consensus and since it did not therefore serve to mobilise the population. Quite the opposite occurred: existing lines of political and ideological fracture were deepened by [[Portugal during World War I|Portugal's intervention in the First World War]].<ref>Ribeiro de Meneses, 2000</ref> The lack of consensus around Portugal's intervention in turn made possible the appearance of two dictatorships, led by General [[Pimenta de Castro]] (January\u2013May 1915) and [[Sid\u00f3nio Pais]] (December 1917 \u2013 December 1918).\n\n[[Sidonismo]], also known as ''Dezembrismo'' (\"Decemberism\"), aroused a strong interest among historians, largely as a result of the elements of modernity that it contained.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Brand\u00e3o, 1990</ref><ref>Ramalho, 1998</ref><ref>Ribeiro de Meneses, 1998</ref><ref>Armando Silva, 1999</ref><ref>Samara, 2003</ref><ref>Santos, 2003</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Telo has made clear the way in which this regime predated some of the political solutions invented by the [[totalitarian]] and [[fascist]] dictatorships of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Teixeira, 2000, pp. 11\u201324</ref> Sid\u00f3nio Pais undertook the rescue of traditional values, notably the ''P\u00e1tria'' (\"Homeland\"), and attempted to rule in a charismatic fashion.\n\nA move was made to abolish traditional political parties and to alter the existing mode of national representation in parliament (which, it was claimed, exacerbated divisions within the ''P\u00e1tria'') through the creation of a [[corporative]] [[Senate]], the founding of a single-party (the [[Partido Nacional Republicano|National Republican Party]]), and the attribution of a mobilising function to the leader. The state carved out an economically interventionist role for itself while, at the same time, repressing [[working-class movements]] and leftist republicans. Sid\u00f3nio Pais also attempted to restore public order and to overcome some of the rifts of the recent past, making the republic more acceptable to [[monarchists]] and [[Catholics]].\n\n=== Political instability ===\n\nThe vacuum of power created by Sid\u00f3nio Pais's murder<ref>Medina, 1994</ref> on 14 December 1918 led the country to a brief [[civil war]]. The monarchy's restoration was proclaimed in the north of Portugal (known as the [[Monarchy of the North]]) on 19 January 1919, and four days later a monarchist insurrection broke out in [[Lisbon]]. A republican coalition government, led by [[Jos\u00e9 Relvas]], coordinated the struggle against the monarchists by loyal army units and armed civilians. After a series of clashes the monarchists were definitively chased from [[Porto|Oporto]] on 13 February 1919. This military victory allowed the PRP to return to government and to emerge triumphant from the elections held later that year, having won the usual absolute majority.\n\nIt was during this restoration of the \u2018old\u2019 republic that an attempted reform was carried out in order to provide the regime with greater stability. In August 1919 a conservative president was elected&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]] (whose Evolutionist party had come together in wartime with the PRP to form a flawed, because incomplete, Sacred Union)&nbsp;\u2013 and his office was given the power to dissolve parliament. Relations with the [[Holy See]], restored by Sid\u00f3nio Pais, were preserved. The president used his new power to resolve a crisis of government in May 1921, naming a [[Liberal Party (Portugal)|Liberal]] government (the Liberal party being the result of the postwar fusion of Evolutionists and Unionists) to prepare the forthcoming elections.\n\nThese were held on 10 July 1921, with victory going, as was usually the case, to the party in power. However, Liberal government did not last long. On 19 October a military ''pronunciamento'' was carried out during which&nbsp;\u2013 and apparently against the wishes of the coup's leaders&nbsp;\u2013 a number of prominent conservative figures, including [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Granjo]], were assassinated. This event, known as the \u2018[[Bloody Night (Lisbon, 1921)|night of blood]]\u2019<ref>Brand\u00e3o, 1991</ref> left a deep wound among political elites and public opinion. There could be no greater demonstration of the essential fragility of the Republic's institutions and proof that the regime was democratic in name only, since it did not even admit the possibility of the rotation in power characteristic of the elitist regimes of the nineteenth century.\n\nA new round of elections on 29 January 1922 inaugurated a fresh period of stability: the PRP once again emerged from the contest with an absolute majority. Discontent with this situation had not, however, disappeared. Numerous accusations of corruption, and the manifest failure to resolve pressing social concerns wore down the more visible PRP leaders while making the opposition's attacks more deadly. At the same time, moreover, all political parties suffered from growing internal factionalism, especially the PRP itself. The party system was fractured and discredited.<ref name=\"Lopes, 1994\" /><ref>Jo\u00e3o Silva, 1997</ref>\n\nThis is clearly shown by the fact that regular PRP victories at the ballot box did not lead to stable government. Between 1910 and 1926, there were forty-five governments. The opposition of [[List of Presidents of Portugal|presidents]] to single-party governments, internal dissent within the PRP, the party's almost non-existent internal discipline, and its desire to group together and lead all republican forces made any government's task practically impossible. Many different formulas were attempted, including single-party governments, coalitions, and presidential executives, but none succeeded. Force was clearly the sole means open to the opposition if the PRP wanted to enjoy the fruits of power.<ref>Schwartzman, 1989</ref><ref name=\"Pinto, 2000\">Pinto, 2000</ref>\n\n=== Evaluation of the republican experiment ===\nHistorians have emphasized the failure and collapse of the republican dream by the 1920s. Sardica summarizes the consensus of historians:\n:within a few years, large parts of the key economic forces, intellectuals, opinion-makers and middle classes changed from left to right, trading the unfulfilled utopia of a developing and civic republicanism for notions of \"order,\" \"stability\" and \"security\". For many who had helped, supported or simply cheered the Republic in 1910, hoping that the new political situation would repair the monarchy\u2019s flaws (government instability, financial crisis, economic backwardness and civic anomie), the conclusion to be drawn, in the 1920s, was that the remedy for national maladies called for much more than the simple removal of the king....The First Republic collapsed and died as a result of the confrontation between raised hopes and meager deeds.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardica, \"The Memory of the Portuguese First Republic throughout the Twentieth Century\" (2011) ''E-Journal of Portuguese History'' (Summer 2011) 9#1 pp 1\u201327. [http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/html/issue17/pdf/v9n1a04.pdf online]</ref>\n\nSardica, however, also points out the permanent impact of the republican experiment:\n:Despite its overall failure, the First Republic endowed twentieth-century Portugal with an insurpassable and enduring legacy\u2014a renewed civil law, the basis for an educational revolution, the principle of separation between State and Church, the overseas empire (only brought to an end in 1975), and a strong symbolic culture whose materializations (the national flag, the national anthem and the naming of streets) nobody has dared to alter and which still define the present-day collective identity of the Portuguese. The Republic\u2019s prime legacy was indeed that of memory.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardica, \"The Memory of the Portuguese First Republic throughout the Twentieth Century\" (2011)</ref>\n\n=== 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n\n{{Main|28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\n[[File:Desfile de tropas 28 de Maio 1926.jpg|thumb|[[Gomes da Costa]] and his troops march victorious into Lisbon on 6 June 1926.]]\nBy the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour another authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Since the opposition's constitutional route to power was blocked by the various means deployed by the PRP to protect itself, it turned to the army for support. The political awareness of the armed forces had grown during the war, and many of their leaders had not forgiven the PRP for sending them to a war they did not want to fight.<ref name=\"Ferreira, 1992a\">Ferreira, 1992a</ref>\n\nThey seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of \u2018order\u2019 against the \u2018chaos\u2019 that was taking over the country. Links were established between conservative figures and military officers, who added their own political and corporative demands to the already complex equation. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]] enjoyed the support of most army units and even of most political parties. As had been the case in December 1917, the population of Lisbon did not rise to defend the Republic, leaving it at the mercy of the army.<ref name=\"Ferreira, 1992a\" />\n\nThere are few global and up-to-date studies of this turbulent third phase of the Republic's existence.<ref>Marques, 1973</ref><ref>Telo, 1980</ref><ref>Telo, 1984</ref> Nevertheless, much has been written about the crisis and fall of the regime and the 28 May movement.<ref name=\"Pinto, 2000\" /><ref>Cruz, 1986</ref><ref>Cabral, 1993</ref><ref>Rosas, 1997</ref><ref>Martins, 1998</ref><ref>Afonso, 2001</ref> The First Republic continues to be the subject of an intense debate. A historiographical balance sheet by Armando Malheiro da Silva (2000) identifies three main interpretations. For some historians the First Republic was a progressive and increasingly democratic regime. For others it was essentially a prolongation of the liberal and elitist regimes of the 19th century. A third group chooses to highlight the regime's revolutionary, Jacobin and dictatorial nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n== Estado Novo (1933\u20131974) ==\n{{Main|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|upright|Portuguese colonies in Africa by the time of the Colonial War.]]\n\n=== Salazar dictatorship ===\nPolitical chaos, several strikes, harsh relations with the Church, and considerable economic problems aggravated by a disastrous [[Portugal in the Great War|military intervention in the First World War]] led to the military [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]]. This coup installed the \"Second Republic\", which started as the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) and became the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' (New State) in 1933, led by economist [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]]. He transformed Portugal into a sort of [[Fascist]] regime that evolved into a single-party [[Fascist corporatism|corporative]] regime. Portugal, although neutral, informally aided the Nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339).\n\nSalazar's policy after the war was to provide a certain level of [[liberalization]] in politics, in terms of organized opposition with more [[freedom of the press]]. Opposition parties were tolerated to an extent, but they were also controlled, limited, and manipulated, with the result that they split into factions and never formed a united opposition.<ref>Dawn L.

The operations resulted in a Portuguese defeat and the loss of the colonies in [[India]]. Independence movements also became active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]; the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] started. Some 122,000 Africans died in the conflict.<ref>Clodfelter 2017: 561</ref> Portugal, during this period, was never an outcast, and was a founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).\n\nAfter the death of Salazar in 1970, his replacement by [[Marcelo Caetano]] offered a certain hope that the regime would open up, the ''primavera marcelista'' (Marcelist spring). However the colonial wars in Africa continued, [[political prisoner]]s remained incarcerated, freedom of association was not restored, [[censorship]] was only slightly eased and the [[election]]s remained tightly controlled.\n\nThe regime retained its characteristic traits: censorship, corporativeness, with a market economy dominated by a handful of economical groups, continuous surveillance and intimidation of several sectors of society through the use of a political police and techniques instilling fear (such as arbitrary imprisonment, systematic political persecution and even assassination of anti-regime insurgents).\n\n== The Third Republic (1974\u2013) ==\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso|Third Portuguese Republic}}\nThe \"[[Carnation Revolution]]\" of April 25, 1974, an effectively bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the \"Third Republic\".

This period was marked by political turmoil, violence, and instability, and the nationalization of industries.

The oldest human fossil is the skull discovered in the [[Cave of Aroeira]] in [[Almonda]]. Later [[Neanderthal]]s roamed the northern Iberian peninsula. [[Homo sapiens]] arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago.\n\nPre-Celtic tribes such as [[Lusitanians]], [[Turduli]] and [[Oestriminis]] lived in the centre and north. In the south the [[Cynetes]] lived in the Algarve and Lower Alentejo regions before the 6th century BC, developed the city of [[Tartessos]] and the written [[Tartessian language]], and left many [[stelae]] in the south of the country. Early in the first millennium BC, waves of [[Celts]] from [[Central Europe]] invaded and intermarried with the local populations to form several ethnic groups and many tribes. \nTheir presence is traceable, in broad outline, through archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated the northern and central area, while the south retained much of its [[Tartessos|Tartessian]] character, combined with the [[Celtici]] until the Roman conquest. Some small, semi-permanent trading settlements were founded by Phoenician-Carthaginians on the southern coast of the Algarve.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] invasion in the 3rd century BC lasted several centuries, and developed the Roman provinces of [[Lusitania]] in the south and [[Gallaecia]] in the north. Numerous Roman sites include works of engineering, baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, layman's homes, coins, sarcophagi, and ceramics. As elsewhere in [[Western Europe]], there was a sharp decline in urban life during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] following the fall of Rome. \nGermanic tribes (that the Romans referred to as [[Barbarian]]s) controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries. These included the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] centred in Braga and the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in the south. Eventually the Visigoths seized power in the whole of Iberia.\nUnder the [[Visigoths]] a new class emerged, a [[nobility]], which played a tremendous social and political role during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Church also began to play a very important part within the state, but since the Visigoths did not know Latin the Catholic bishops continued the Roman system of governance. The [[clergy]] started to emerge as a high-ranking class.\n\nIn 711-716 an invasion by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate, comprising Berbers from North Africa and Arabs from the Middle East plus other Muslims from all around the Islamic world, conquered the Visigoth Kingdom and founded the Islamic State of Al Andalus. The Umayyads reigned supreme and advanced through Iberia and France until the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and endured in the south until the final reconquista of the [[Algarve]]([[Gharb Al-Andalus]]) in 1294. \nLisbon and the rest of what would become Portugal, was reconquered by the early 12th century. At the end of the 9th century, a county based in the area of [[Portus Cale]] was established under King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], and by the 10th century, the Counts were known as the ''Magnus Dux Portucalensium'' (Grand Duke of the Portuguese). (''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', ''Portugalli\u00e6'') The [[Kingdom of Asturias]] was later divided so that northern \"Portugal\" became part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]].\n\nInitially a vassal of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, Portugal grew in power and territory and gained ''de facto'' independence during weak Leonese reigns. In 1071 Garcia II of Galicia was declared [[King of Portugal]] and in 1095, Portugal broke away from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. At the end of the 11th century, the Burgundian knight [[Henry, count of Portugal|Henry]] became count of Portugal and defended its independence by merging the [[County of Portugal]] and the [[County of Coimbra]]. Henry's son [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] proclaimed himself ''Prince of Portugal'' on 24 June 1128 and King of Portugal in 1139 with Guimar\u00e3es (Vimarens) as capital. In 1179 a papal bull officially recognised Afonso I as king. The Algarve was conquered from the [[Moors]] in 1249, and in 1255 [[Lisbon]] became the capital. Portugal's land boundaries have remained almost unchanged since then. \n\nDuring the reign of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], the Portuguese defeated the [[Castilians]] in a war over the throne (1385) and established a political alliance with [[Kingdom of England|England]] (by the [[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]] in 1386) that has endured and continued to the present day. This is the world\u2019s oldest military agreement between two sovereign nations.\n\nFrom the late [[Middle Ages]], in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Portugal]] ascended to the status of a [[Great power|world power]] during Europe's \"[[Age of Discovery]]\" as it [[Portuguese Empire|built up a vast empire]], including possessions in South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Over the following two centuries, Portugal kept most of its colonies, but gradually lost much of its wealth and status as the Dutch, English, and French took an increasing share of the [[Spice trade|spice]] and [[History of slavery|slave trades]] by surrounding or conquering the widely scattered Portuguese trading posts and territories. Signs of military decline began with two disastrous battles: the [[Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in Morocco in 1578 and Spain's abortive attempt to conquer England in 1588 by means of the [[Spanish Armada]] \u2013 Portugal was then in an uncomfortable [[Iberian Union|dynastic union with Spain]] and contributed ships to the Spanish invasion fleet. The country was further weakened by the destruction of much of its capital city in an [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake in 1755]], occupation during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the loss of its largest colony, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], in 1822. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two\nmillion [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] left Portugal to live in Brazil and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=77 |title=Portugal Seeks Balance of Emigration, Immigration |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date=2002-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, there was a revolution that deposed the monarchy. Amid corruption, repression of the church, and the near-bankruptcy of the state, a military coup in 1926 installed a dictatorship that remained until another coup in 1974. The new government instituted sweeping [[democracy|democratic]] reforms and granted independence to all of Portugal's African colonies in 1975. Portugal is a founding member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). It entered the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1986.\n\n== Etymology ==<!--linked-->\n\nThe word Portugal derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name '''''[[Portus Cale]]'''''. Cale or [[Cailleach]] was the name of a Celtic deity<ref>Cale, the mother goddess of the Celtic people, the one who armed with a hammer formed mountains and valleys. She hides in the rocks. She is Mother Nature. Her other name is Cailleach (Gallaecia/Galiza)</ref> and the name of an early settlement located at the mouth of the [[Douro River]] (present-day [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]), which flows into the Atlantic Ocean in the north of what is now Portugal. Around 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the Carthaginians during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale and renamed it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale''). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''.\n\nThe name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and [[Minho River|Minho]], the Minho flowing along what would become the northern [[Portugal-Spain border]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\nThe etymology of ''Cale'' points to Cale<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=apcmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA160&dq=lisbon+etymology#PPA55,M1 |title=Local etymology: a derivative ... \u2013 Google Books |accessdate=2010-08-22|year=1859|last1=Charnock |first1=Richard Stephen }}</ref> being a [[Celts|Celtic]] name, like many others found in the region. The word ''cale'' or ''cala'' meant \"port\", an \"inlet\" or \"harbour\", referring to an older Celtic harbour.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=POGEbFpGHigC&pg=RA1-PA270&dq=celtic+cale+harbour |title=Celtic Linguistics |accessdate=2010-08-22|isbn=978-0-415-20479-8|year=1706|last1=Pezron |first1=Paul }}</ref> Today\u2019s Gaelic word for harbour is still ''cala''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faclair.com/?txtSearch=Cala|title=Am Faclair Beag \u2013 Scottish Gaelic Dictionary|first=William Robertson, Michael Bauer, Edward|last=Dwelly|date=|website=www.faclair.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Some argue it is the stem of Gallaecia, again of Celtic derivation.

And ''[[port wine|port]]'' became the English name of the wine actually produced further inland, in the Upper Douro Valley region, but exported through Porto. The name ''Cale'' is today reflected in ''Gaia'' ([[Vila Nova de Gaia]]), a city on the south bank of the river.\n\n== Early history ==\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}\n[[File:Aroeira3.jpg|thumb|[[Aroeira 3]] skull of 400,000 year old ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.<br />The oldest trace of human history in Portugal.]]\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal has been inhabited by humans since circa 400,000 years ago, when [[Homo heidelbergensis]] entered the area.

The [[Romanization of Hispania]] took several centuries. The Roman provinces that covered present-day Portugal were [[Lusitania]] in the south and [[Gallaecia]] in the north.\n\nNumerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal. Some of the urban remains are quite large, such as [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga]]. Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, and layman's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, sarcophagi, and ceramics are also numerous.\n\nFollowing the fall of Rome, the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] and the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] controlled the territory between the 5th and 7th centuries.\n\n== Romanization ==\n{{Further|Roman conquest of Hispania|Romanization of Hispania}}\n[[File:Portugalliaingallaeciaetlusitania.png|thumb|The Roman Provinces [[Lusitania]] and [[Gallaecia]], after the reorganization of [[Diocletian]] AD 298]]\n\nRomanization began with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] army in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 218 BC during the [[Second Punic War]] against [[Carthage]]. The Romans sought to conquer [[Lusitania]], a territory that included all of modern Portugal south of the [[Douro]] river and Spanish [[Extremadura]], with its capital at [[Emerita Augusta]] (now [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|M\u00e9rida]]).<ref name=\"infopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infopedia.pt/$romanizacao-da-peninsula-iberica|title=Artigo de apoio Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Romaniza\u00e7\u00e3o da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica|last=Infop\u00e9dia|date=|website=Infop\u00e9dia \u2013 Dicion\u00e1rios Porto Editora|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMining was the primary factor that made the Romans interested in conquering the region: one of Rome's strategic objectives was to cut off Carthaginian access to the Iberian copper, tin, gold, and silver mines.

Nonetheless, he was responsible for raids into the more settled Romanized parts of Southern Portugal and Lusitania that involved the victimization of the inhabitants.<ref name=\"infopedia\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvp|Disney|2009}}</ref>\n\nThe conquest of the Iberian Peninsula was complete two centuries after the Roman arrival, when they defeated the remaining Cantabri, Astures and Gallaeci in the [[Cantabrian Wars]] in the time of Emperor [[Augustus]] (19 BC). In 74 AD, [[Vespasian]] granted [[Latin Rights]] to most municipalities of Lusitania. In 212 AD, the [[Constitutio Antoniniana]] gave [[Roman citizenship]] to all free subjects of the empire and, at the end of the century, the emperor [[Diocletian]] founded the province of [[Gallaecia]], which included modern-day [[Norte Region, Portugal|northern Portugal]], with its capital at Bracara Augusta (now [[Braga]]).<ref name=\"infopedia\" /> As well as mining, the Romans also developed agriculture, on some of the best agricultural land in the empire. In what is now [[Alentejo]], vines and cereals were cultivated, and fishing was intensively pursued in the coastal belt of the [[Algarve]], [[P\u00f3voa de Varzim]], [[Matosinhos]], Troia and the coast of Lisbon, for the manufacture of [[garum]] that was exported by Roman trade routes to the entire empire.

Since the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on Catholic bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws established during the Visigothic monarchy were thus made by councils of bishops, and the [[clergy]] started to emerge as a high-ranking class.\n\n== Al Andalus (711\u2013868) ==\n{{Main|Al-Andalus}}\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 750-en.svg|thumb|Portugal part of [[Al-Andalus|Al-Andalus Province]] of [[Ummayad caliphate]] in 750.]]\n\nDuring the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph [[Al-Walid I]], the Berber commander [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] led a small force that landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April 711, ostensibly to intervene in a [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] civil war. After a decisive victory over King [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]] on 19 July 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by the Arab governor [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] of [[Ifriqiya]], brought most of the Visigothic kingdom under Muslim occupation in a seven-year campaign. The Visigothic resistance to this invasion was ineffective, though sieges were required to sack a couple of cities. This is in part because the ruling Visigoth population is estimated at a mere 1 to 2% of the total population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Caracter\u00edsticas generales del poblamiento y la arqueolog\u00eda funeraria visigoda de Hispania |work=Espacio, Tiempo y Forma, S.

Muslims called their conquests in Iberia '[[al-Andalus]]' and in what was to become Portugal, they mainly consisted of the old Roman province of [[Lusitania]] (the central and southern regions of the country), while [[Gallaecia]] (the northern regions) remained unsubdued. Until the Berber revolt in the 730s, al-Andalus was treated as a dependency of Umayyad North Africa.

For the next several centuries, much of the Iberian Peninsula remained under Umayyad rule. Much of the populace was allowed to remain Christian, and many of the lesser feudal rulers worked out deals where they would submit to Umayyad rule in order to remain in power. They would pay a [[jizya]] tax, kill or turn over rebels, and in return receive support from the central government.

After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up its realms, King Alfonso III named V\u00edmara Peres as its first count. Since the rule of Count [[Diogo Fernandes (count)|Diogo Fernandes]], the county increased in size and importance and, from the 10th century onward, with Count [[Gon\u00e7alo Mendes]] as ''Magnus Dux Portucalensium'' (Grand Duke of the Portuguese), the Portuguese counts started using the title of duke, indicating even larger importance and territory. The region became known simultaneously as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and ''Portugalia''\u2014the [[County of Portugal]].<ref>{{harvp|Ribeiro|Hermano|2004}}</ref> The Kingdom of Asturias was later divided as a result of dynastic disputes; the northern region of Portugal became part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]] and later part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]].\n\nSuebi-Visigothic arts and architecture, in particular sculpture, had shown a natural continuity with the Roman period. With the Reconquista, new artistic trends took hold, with Galician-Asturian influences more visible than the Leonese. The Portuguese group was characterized by a general return to classicism. The county courts of [[Viseu]] and [[Coimbra]] played a very important role in this process. Mozarabic architecture was found in the south, in Lisbon and beyond, while in the Christian realms Galician-Portuguese and Asturian architecture prevailed.<ref name=\"earlyportugal\" />\n\nIn 968, the Vikings appeared in the r\u00edas of Galicia. They killed the bishop of Compostela in battle, but his successor St [[Rudesind]] rallied the forces of the region and finally killed the Viking leader, [[Gunrod]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Livermore |first1=H. V. |title=A New History of Portugal |page=37}}</ref>\n\nAs a vassal of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, Portugal grew in power and territory and occasionally gained ''de facto'' independence during weak Leonese reigns; Count Mendo Gon\u00e7alves even became regent of the Kingdom of Leon between 999 and 1008. In 1070, the Portuguese Count [[Nuno Mendes (count)|Nuno Mendes]] desired the Portuguese title and fought the [[Battle of Pedroso]] on 18 February 1071 with [[Garcia II of Galicia]], who gained the Galician title, which included Portugal, after the 1065 partition of the Leonese realms. The battle resulted in Nuno Mendes' death and the declaration of Garcia as [[King of Portugal]], the first person to claim this title.<ref>{{harvp|Ribeiro|Hermano|2004|p=44}}</ref> Garcia styled himself as \"King of Portugal and Galicia\" (''Garcia Rex Portugallie et Galleciae''). Garcia's brothers, [[Sancho II of Castile]] and [[Alfonso VI of Leon]], united and annexed Garcia's kingdom in 1071 as well. They agreed to split it among themselves; however, Sancho was killed by a noble the next year. Alfonso took Castile for himself and Garcia recovered his kingdom of Portugal and Galicia. In 1073, Alfonso VI gathered all power, and beginning in 1077, styled himself ''Imperator totius Hispani\u00e6'' (Emperor of All Hispania). When the emperor died, the Crown was left to his daughter [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n|Urraca]], while his illegitimate daughter [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa]] inherited the [[County of Portugal]]; in 1095, Portugal broke away from the [[Kingdom of Galicia]]. Its territories, consisting largely of mountains, moorland and forests, were bounded on the north by the Minho River, and on the south by the [[Mondego River]].\n\n=== Foundation of the Kingdom of Portugal ===\n\nAt the end of the 11th century, the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] knight [[Henry, count of Portugal|Henry]] became count of Portugal and defended its independence by merging the [[County of Portugal]] and the [[County of Coimbra]]. His efforts were assisted by a civil war that raged between [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and distracted his enemies. Henry's son [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] took control of the county upon his death. The city of Braga, the unofficial Catholic centre of the Iberian Peninsula, faced new competition from other regions. Lords of the cities of [[Coimbra]] and [[Porto]] fought with [[Braga]]'s clergy and demanded the independence of the reconstituted county.\n\nPortugal traces its national origin to 24 June 1128, the date of the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]]. Afonso proclaimed himself ''Prince of Portugal'' after this battle and in 1139, he assumed the title ''King of Portugal''. In 1143, the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n recognised him as King of Portugal by the [[Treaty of Zamora]]. In 1179, the papal bull [[Manifestis Probatum]] of [[Pope Alexander III]] officially recognised Afonso I as king. After the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]], the first capital of Portugal was [[Guimar\u00e3es]], from which the first king ruled. Later, when Portugal was already officially independent, he ruled from Coimbra.\n\n=== Affirmation of Portugal ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1279\u20131415)}}\nThe [[Algarve]], the southernmost region of Portugal, was finally conquered from the [[Moors]] in 1249, and in 1255 the capital shifted to [[Lisbon]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=76}}</ref> Neighboring Spain would not complete its ''Reconquista'' [[Granada War|until 1492]], almost 250 years later.<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> Portugal's land boundaries have been notably stable for the rest of the country's history.

Though not dominant in European affairs, Portugal did have an extensive colonial trading empire throughout the world backed by a powerful [[thalassocracy]].\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Portuguese Empire]] can be traced to 25 July 1415, when the Portuguese [[wikt:armada#Portuguese|Armada]] set sail for the rich [[Islamic]] trading center of [[Ceuta]] in [[North Africa]]. The Armada was accompanied by King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], his sons Prince [[Duarte of Portugal|Duarte]] (a future king), Prince [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Pedro]], and Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], and the legendary Portuguese hero [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> On 21 August 1415, [[Conquest of Ceuta|Ceuta was conquered by Portugal]], and the long-lived Portuguese Empire was founded.<ref name=\"Livermore_108\">{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=108}}</ref>\n\nThe conquest of Ceuta was facilitated by a major civil war that had been engaging the Muslims of the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa) since 1411.<ref name=\"Livermore_108\" /> This civil war prevented a re-capture of Ceuta from the Portuguese, when the king of [[Granada]] [[Muhammed IX, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed IX]], the Left-Handed, laid siege to Ceuta and attempted to coordinate forces in Morocco and attract aid and assistance for the effort from Tunis.<ref name=\"Livermore_109\">{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=109}}</ref> The Muslim attempt to retake Ceuta was ultimately unsuccessful and Ceuta remained the first part of the new Portuguese Empire.<ref name=\"Livermore_109\" /> Further steps were taken that would soon expand the Portuguese Empire much further.\n\nIn 1418, two of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]'s captains, [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] and [[Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira]], were driven by a storm to an island that they called [[Porto Santo island|Porto Santo]] (\"Holy Port\") in gratitude for their rescue from the shipwreck. In 1419, [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] disembarked on the [[Madeira Island|Island of Madeira]]. Uninhabited Madeira was colonized by the Portuguese in 1420.<ref name=\"Livermore_109\" />\n\nBetween 1427 and 1431, most of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] were discovered and these uninhabited islands were colonized by the Portuguese in 1445. Portuguese expeditions may have attempted to colonize the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canary Islands]] as early as 1336, but the [[Crown of Castile]] objected to any Portuguese claim to them. Castile began its own conquest of the Canaries in 1402. Castile expelled the last Portuguese from the Canary islands in 1459, and they would eventually become part of the Spanish Empire.<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=249}}</ref>\n\nIn 1434, [[Gil Eanes]] passed [[Cape Bojador]], south of [[Morocco]]. The trip marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of [[Africa]]. Before this event, very little was known in Europe about what lay beyond the cape. At the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, those who tried to venture there became lost, which gave birth to legends of [[sea monster]]s. Some setbacks occurred: in 1436 the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Canaries]] were officially recognized as Castilian by the pope\u2014earlier they had been recognized as Portuguese; in 1438, the Portuguese were defeated in a military expedition to [[History of Tangier|Tangier]].\n\nThese setbacks did not deter the Portuguese from pursuing their exploratory efforts. In 1448, on the small island of [[Arguim]] off the coast of [[Mauritania]], an important castle was built to function as a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'', or trading post, for commerce with inland Africa. Some years before, the first African [[gold]] was brought to Portugal that circumvented the Arab caravans that crossed the Sahara. Some time later, the [[caravel]]s explored the [[Gulf of Guinea]], which led to the discovery of several uninhabited islands: [[Cape Verde]], [[Fernando P\u00f3o (island)|Fern\u00e3o P\u00f3o]], [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]], [[Principe Island|Pr\u00edncipe]] and [[Annob\u00f3n]].<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=248}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 November 1460, Prince Henry the Navigator died.<ref name=\"Hallett_164\">{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=164}}</ref> He had been the leading patron of maritime exploration by Portugal and immediately following his death, exploration lapsed. Henry's patronage had shown that profits could be made from the trade that followed the discovery of new lands. Accordingly, when exploration commenced again, private merchants led the way in attempting to stretch trade routes further down the African coast.<ref name=\"Hallett_164\" />\n\nIn the 1470s, Portuguese trading ships reached the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]].<ref name=\"Hallett_164\" /> In 1471, the Portuguese captured Tangier, after years of attempts. Eleven years later, the fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] in the town of [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea was built. [[Christopher Columbus]] set sail aboard the fleet of ships taking materials and building crews to Elmina in December 1481. In 1483, [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] reached and explored the [[Congo River]].\n\n=== Discovery of the sea route to India and the Treaty of Tordesillas ===\n[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Vasco da Gama landing in [[Kerala, India]].]]\nIn 1484, Portugal officially rejected Columbus' idea of reaching [[India]] from the west, because it was seen as unfeasible. Some historians have claimed that the Portuguese had already performed fairly accurate calculations concerning the size of the world and therefore knew that sailing west to reach the Indies would require a far longer journey than navigating to the east. However, this continues to be debated. Thus began a long-lasting dispute that eventually resulted in the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Castile in 1494. The treaty divided the (largely undiscovered) [[New World]] equally between the Portuguese and the Castilians, along a north\u2013south [[prime meridian|meridian line]] 370 leagues (1770&nbsp;km/1100 miles) west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands, with all lands to the east belonging to Portugal and all lands to the west to Castile.\n\n[[File:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Brazil issued by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in 1519.]]\nWith the expedition beyond the [[Cape of Good Hope]] by [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1487,<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=129}}</ref> the richness of [[India]] was now accessible. Indeed, the cape takes its name from the promise of rich trade with the east. Between 1498 and 1501, [[P\u00earo de Barcelos]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Lavrador]] explored [[North America]]. At the same time, [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] reached [[Ethiopia]] by land.

Trade with the east had effectively been cut off since the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453. Accordingly, Cabral turned away from exploring the coast of the new land of Brazil and sailed southeast, back across the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope. Cabral reached [[Sofala]] on the east coast of Africa in July 1500.<ref name=\"Livermore_138_139\" /> In 1505, a Portuguese fort was established here and the land around the fort would later become the [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese colony of Mozambique]].<ref>{{harvp|Hallett|1970|p=217}}</ref>\n\nCabral's fleet then sailed east and landed in [[Calicut]] in [[India]] in September 1500.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=139}}</ref> Here they traded for pepper and, more significantly, opened European sea trade with the empires of the east.

Impostors claimed to be King Sebastian in 1584, 1585, 1595 and 1598. \"[[Sebastianism]]\", the myth that the young king will return to Portugal on a foggy day, has prevailed until modern times.\n\n=== Decline of the Portuguese Empire under the Philippine Dynasty ===\n[[File:Batalha dos Guararapes.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[First Battle of Guararapes|Battle of Guararapes]]]]\nAfter the 16th century, Portugal gradually saw its wealth and influence decrease. Portugal was officially an autonomous state, but in actuality, the country was in a [[personal union]] with the Spanish crown from 1580 to 1640.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=163\u2013172}}</ref> The ''Council of Portugal'' remained independent inasmuch as it was one of the key administrative units of the Castilian monarchy, legally on equal terms with the [[Council of the Indies]].<ref>{{harvp|Elliott|2002|p=274}}</ref> The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and the enemies of Spain became the enemies of Portugal. England had been an ally of Portugal since the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, but [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war between Spain and England]] led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal's oldest ally and the [[Capture of Ormuz (1622)|loss of Hormuz]] in 1622. From 1595 to 1663, the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]] led to invasions of many countries in Asia and competition for commercial interests in Japan, Africa and South America. In 1624, the Dutch seized [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], the capital of Brazil;<ref name=\"Livermore_170\">{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=170}}</ref> in 1630, they seized Pernambuco in northern Brazil.<ref name=\"Livermore_170\" /> A treaty of 1654 returned Pernambuco to Portuguese control, however.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|p=184}}</ref> Both the English and the Dutch continued to aspire to dominate both the Atlantic slave trade and the spice trade with the Far East.\n\nThe Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long-lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The Dutch captured the entire coast except that of Bahia and much of the interior of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|contemporary Northeastern Brazilian states]] of [[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]], [[Alagoas]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Para\u00edba]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]] and [[Cear\u00e1]], while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Beginning with a major Spanish\u2013Portuguese military operation in 1625, this trend was reversed, and it laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch-controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would re-establish its authority over some lost territories of the [[Portuguese Empire]].\n\n== Portuguese Restoration War (1640\u20131668) ==\n{{Main|Portuguese Restoration War}}\n[[File:Portrait of John, Duke of Braganza c. 1630 (The Royal Castle in Warsaw).png|thumb|John IV of Portugal]]\nAt home, life was calm and serene under the first two Spanish kings, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. They maintained Portugal's status, gave excellent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish [[Noble court|courts]], and Portugal maintained an independent law, currency and government. It was even proposed to move the Spanish capital to [[Lisbon]]. Later, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles lost power.\n\nBecause of this, as well as the general strain on the finances of the Spanish throne as a result of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Braganza]], one of the great native noblemen and a descendant of King Manuel I, was proclaimed King of Portugal as [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] on 1 December 1640, and a war of independence against Spain was launched. The governors of [[History of Ceuta|Ceuta]] did not accept the new king; rather, they maintained their allegiance to Philip IV and Spain.\n\nIn the 17th century, many Portuguese emigrated to Brazil. From 1709, [[John V of Portugal|John V]] prohibited emigration, since Portugal had lost a sizable proportion of its population. Brazil was elevated to a vice-kingdom.\n\n== Pombaline era ==\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1640\u20131777)|Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal}}\n\n[[File:O marques de pombal, conde de Oeiras.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal, Count of Oeiras]]]]\nIn 1738, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, the talented son of a Lisbon squire, began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese [[Ambassador]] in [[London]] and later in [[Vienna]]. The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Maria Anna of Austria]], was fond of De Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]] however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year, and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the Maria Anna's approval, he appointed Melo as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. As the king's confidence in de Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state.\n\nBy 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made [[prime-minister]]. Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]]; and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal.\n\n[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbor.]]\nBut Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and [[guilds]] to regulate every [[commerce|commercial]] activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law on all classes of Portuguese society, from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\nDisaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon was struck by a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] magnitude of 9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent [[tsunami]] and fires. De Melo survived by a stroke of luck and immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: \"What now? We bury the dead and feed the living.\"\n\nDespite the natural disaster, Lisbon\u2019s population suffered no epidemics and within less than one year the city was being rebuilt. The new Lisbon downtown was designed to resist subsequent [[earthquakes]]. [[Architectural]][[Scale model|models]] were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were [[simulated]] by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions: they represent the world's first [[Earthquake-resistant structures]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carsado|first=Rafeala|last2=Lopes|first2=Mario|last3=Bento|first3=Rita|date=August 2004|title=Earthquake Resistant Structures of Portuguese Old \"Pombalino\" Buildings|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/13_918.pdf|journal=13th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his prime minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the Duke of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the minister against his enemies. Based upon his swift resolve, Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment\" and economic progress, while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, furthering [[colonial exploitation]], intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u2013162.</ref>\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis (See ''[[T\u00e1vora affair]]''), and forbade him from coming within 20 miles of her, thus curtailing his influence.\n\n=== Portuguese-led invasion of Spain in 1707 ===\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n\nIn 1707, as part of the War of the Spanish Succession, a joint Portuguese, Dutch, and [[United Kingdom|British]] army, led by the Marquis of Minas, [[Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa, 2nd Marquis of Minas|Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Sousa]], conquered Madrid and acclaimed the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]] as King Charles III of Spain. Along the route to Madrid, the army led by the Marquis of Minas was successful in conquering [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and [[Salamanca]]. Later in the following year, Madrid was reconquered by Spanish troops loyal to the Bourbons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqnet.pt/portal/pessoais/castelobramco_comentarios.html|title=O Portal da Hist\u00f3ria \u2013 Mem\u00f3rias: Ant\u00f3nio do Couto Castelo Branco em 1707|author=|date=|website=www.arqnet.pt|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Ghost War'' ===\n{{Main|Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)}}\nIn 1762 [[France]] and Spain tried to urge Portugal to join the [[Bourbon Family Compact]] by claiming that Great Britain had become too powerful due to its successes in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Joseph refused to accept and maintained that his 1704 alliance with [[Great Britain|Britain]] was no threat.\n\nIn spring 1762, Spanish and French troops invaded Portugal from the north as far as the [[Douro]], while a second column sponsored the [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|Siege of Almeida]], captured the city, and threatened to advance on Lisbon. The arrival of a force of British troops helped the Portuguese army commanded by the [[William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe|Count of Lippe]] by blocking the Franco-Spanish advance and driving them back across the border following the [[Battle of Valencia de Alc\u00e1ntara]]. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, Spain agreed to hand Almeida back to Portugal.\n\n== Crises of the nineteenth century ==\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\nIn 1807, Portugal refused [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s demand to accede to the [[Continental System]] of embargo against the United Kingdom; a French invasion under [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]] followed, and Lisbon was captured on 8 December 1807. British intervention in the [[Peninsular War]] helped in maintaining Portuguese independence; the last French troops were expelled in 1812. The war cost Portugal the town of [[Olivenza|Oliven\u00e7a]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Ertl|first=Alan W.|title=Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Precis of Continental Integration|year=2008|publisher=Dissertation.com|isbn=978-1-59942-983-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC&pg=PA303&dq=province+Oliven%C3%A7a+peninsular+war#v=onepage&q=province%20Oliven%C3%A7a%20peninsular%20war&f=false|page=303}}</ref> now governed by Spain.\n\n[[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil was the Portuguese capital between 1808 and 1821. In 1820, [[constitutionalist]] insurrections took place at [[Porto]] (24 August) and Lisbon (15 September). Lisbon regained its status as the capital of Portugal when Brazil declared its independence from Portugal in 1822.\n\nThe death of King [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] in 1826 led to a crisis of royal succession. His eldest son, [[Pedro I of Brazil]], briefly became [[Pedro IV of Portugal]], but neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, Pedro abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his 7-year-old daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria da Gl\u00f3ria]], on the condition that when she came of age she would marry his brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel]]. Dissatisfaction at Pedro's constitutional reforms led the \"absolutist\" faction of landowners and the church to proclaim Miguel king in February 1828. This led to the [[Liberal Wars]] in which Pedro eventually forced Miguel to abdicate and go into exile in 1834 and place his daughter on throne as Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]].\n\nThe [[1890 British Ultimatum]] was delivered to Portugal on 11 January of that year, an attempt to force the retreat of Portuguese military forces in the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]). The area had been claimed by Portugal, which included it in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", but this clashed with British aspirations to create a railroad link between [[Cairo]] and [[Cape Town]], thereby linking its colonies from the north of Africa to the very south. This diplomatic clash lead to several waves of protest and prompted the downfall of the Portuguese government. The 1890 British Ultimatum was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the British against her oldest ally.<ref>Jo\u00e3o Ferreira Duarte, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/2000/v13/n1/037395ar.pdf The Politics of Non-Translation: A Case Study in Anglo-Portuguese Relations]</ref>\n\nAfter 1815, the Portuguese expanded their trading ports along the African coast, moving inland to take control of Angola and Mozambique. The slave trade was abolished in 1836, in part because many foreign slave ships were flying the Portuguese flag. In [[Portuguese India]], trade flourished in the colony of [[History of Goa|Goa]], with its subsidiary colonies of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], near Hong Kong on the China coast, and [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]], north of Australia. The Portuguese successfully introduced Catholicism and the Portuguese language into their colonies, while most settlers continued to head to Brazil.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1969|pp=299\u2013306}}</ref><ref>Gervase Clarence-Smith, ''The Third Portuguese Empire, 1825\u20131975: A Study in Economic Imperialism'' (1985)</ref>\n\n== The First Republic (1910\u20131926) ==\n{{Main|First Portuguese Republic}}\n\nThe First Republic has, over the course of the recent past, been neglected by many historians in favor of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''. As a result, it is difficult to attempt a global synthesis of the republican period in view of the important gaps that still persist in our knowledge of its political history. As far as the [[5 October 1910 Revolution]] is concerned, a number of valuable studies have been made,<ref>Wheeler, 1972</ref> first among which ranks Vasco Pulido Valente's polemical thesis. This historian posited the [[Jacobin]] and urban nature of the revolution carried out by the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] (PRP) and claimed that the PRP had turned the republican regime into a de facto dictatorship.<ref>Pulido Valente, 1982</ref> This vision clashes with an older interpretation of the First Republic as a progressive and increasingly democratic regime that presented a clear contrast to [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]]'s ensuing dictatorship.<ref>Oliveira Marques, 1991</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. It was secularist and followed the liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role that the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, \"The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualistic middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.\"<ref>Payne, ''A history of Spain and Portugal'' (1973) 2: 559</ref> Under the leadership of [[Afonso Costa]], the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 October\u2014five days after the inauguration of the Republic\u2014the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship.\n\nA series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by [[Afonso Costa]] culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911.\n\n=== Constitution ===\nA republican constitution was approved in 1911, inaugurating a parliamentary regime with reduced presidential powers and two chambers of parliament.<ref>Miranda, 2001</ref> The Republic provoked important fractures within Portuguese society, notably among the essentially monarchist rural population, in the trade unions, and in the Church. Even the PRP had to endure the secession of its more moderate elements, who formed conservative republican parties like the [[Portuguese Evolutionist Party|Evolutionist Party]] and the [[Uni\u00e3o Republicana|Republican Union]]. In spite of these splits, the PRP, led by [[Afonso Costa]], preserved its dominance, largely due to a brand of clientelist politics inherited from the monarchy.<ref name=\"Lopes, 1994\">Lopes, 1994</ref> In view of these tactics, a number of opposition forces were forced to resort to violence in order to enjoy the fruits of power. There are few recent studies of this period of the Republic's existence, known as the \u2018old\u2019 Republic. Nevertheless, an essay by Vasco Pulido Valente should be consulted (1997a), as should the attempt to establish the political, social, and economic context made by M. Villaverde Cabral (1988).\n\nThe PRP viewed the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the African colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime and even around the party.<ref>Teixeira, 1996a</ref> These domestic objectives were not met, since participation in the conflict was not the subject of a national consensus and since it did not therefore serve to mobilise the population. Quite the opposite occurred: existing lines of political and ideological fracture were deepened by [[Portugal during World War I|Portugal's intervention in the First World War]].<ref>Ribeiro de Meneses, 2000</ref> The lack of consensus around Portugal's intervention in turn made possible the appearance of two dictatorships, led by General [[Pimenta de Castro]] (January\u2013May 1915) and [[Sid\u00f3nio Pais]] (December 1917 \u2013 December 1918).\n\n[[Sidonismo]], also known as ''Dezembrismo'' (\"Decemberism\"), aroused a strong interest among historians, largely as a result of the elements of modernity that it contained.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Brand\u00e3o, 1990</ref><ref>Ramalho, 1998</ref><ref>Ribeiro de Meneses, 1998</ref><ref>Armando Silva, 1999</ref><ref>Samara, 2003</ref><ref>Santos, 2003</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Telo has made clear the way in which this regime predated some of the political solutions invented by the [[totalitarian]] and [[fascist]] dictatorships of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Teixeira, 2000, pp. 11\u201324</ref> Sid\u00f3nio Pais undertook the rescue of traditional values, notably the ''P\u00e1tria'' (\"Homeland\"), and attempted to rule in a charismatic fashion.\n\nA move was made to abolish traditional political parties and to alter the existing mode of national representation in parliament (which, it was claimed, exacerbated divisions within the ''P\u00e1tria'') through the creation of a [[corporative]] [[Senate]], the founding of a single-party (the [[Partido Nacional Republicano|National Republican Party]]), and the attribution of a mobilising function to the leader. The state carved out an economically interventionist role for itself while, at the same time, repressing [[working-class movements]] and leftist republicans. Sid\u00f3nio Pais also attempted to restore public order and to overcome some of the rifts of the recent past, making the republic more acceptable to [[monarchists]] and [[Catholics]].\n\n=== Political instability ===\n\nThe vacuum of power created by Sid\u00f3nio Pais's murder<ref>Medina, 1994</ref> on 14 December 1918 led the country to a brief [[civil war]]. The monarchy's restoration was proclaimed in the north of Portugal (known as the [[Monarchy of the North]]) on 19 January 1919, and four days later a monarchist insurrection broke out in [[Lisbon]]. A republican coalition government, led by [[Jos\u00e9 Relvas]], coordinated the struggle against the monarchists by loyal army units and armed civilians. After a series of clashes the monarchists were definitively chased from [[Porto|Oporto]] on 13 February 1919. This military victory allowed the PRP to return to government and to emerge triumphant from the elections held later that year, having won the usual absolute majority.\n\nIt was during this restoration of the \u2018old\u2019 republic that an attempted reform was carried out in order to provide the regime with greater stability. In August 1919 a conservative president was elected&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]] (whose Evolutionist party had come together in wartime with the PRP to form a flawed, because incomplete, Sacred Union)&nbsp;\u2013 and his office was given the power to dissolve parliament. Relations with the [[Holy See]], restored by Sid\u00f3nio Pais, were preserved. The president used his new power to resolve a crisis of government in May 1921, naming a [[Liberal Party (Portugal)|Liberal]] government (the Liberal party being the result of the postwar fusion of Evolutionists and Unionists) to prepare the forthcoming elections.\n\nThese were held on 10 July 1921, with victory going, as was usually the case, to the party in power. However, Liberal government did not last long. On 19 October a military ''pronunciamento'' was carried out during which&nbsp;\u2013 and apparently against the wishes of the coup's leaders&nbsp;\u2013 a number of prominent conservative figures, including [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Granjo]], were assassinated. This event, known as the \u2018[[Bloody Night (Lisbon, 1921)|night of blood]]\u2019<ref>Brand\u00e3o, 1991</ref> left a deep wound among political elites and public opinion. There could be no greater demonstration of the essential fragility of the Republic's institutions and proof that the regime was democratic in name only, since it did not even admit the possibility of the rotation in power characteristic of the elitist regimes of the nineteenth century.\n\nA new round of elections on 29 January 1922 inaugurated a fresh period of stability: the PRP once again emerged from the contest with an absolute majority. Discontent with this situation had not, however, disappeared. Numerous accusations of corruption, and the manifest failure to resolve pressing social concerns wore down the more visible PRP leaders while making the opposition's attacks more deadly. At the same time, moreover, all political parties suffered from growing internal factionalism, especially the PRP itself. The party system was fractured and discredited.<ref name=\"Lopes, 1994\" /><ref>Jo\u00e3o Silva, 1997</ref>\n\nThis is clearly shown by the fact that regular PRP victories at the ballot box did not lead to stable government. Between 1910 and 1926, there were forty-five governments. The opposition of [[List of Presidents of Portugal|presidents]] to single-party governments, internal dissent within the PRP, the party's almost non-existent internal discipline, and its desire to group together and lead all republican forces made any government's task practically impossible. Many different formulas were attempted, including single-party governments, coalitions, and presidential executives, but none succeeded. Force was clearly the sole means open to the opposition if the PRP wanted to enjoy the fruits of power.<ref>Schwartzman, 1989</ref><ref name=\"Pinto, 2000\">Pinto, 2000</ref>\n\n=== Evaluation of the republican experiment ===\nHistorians have emphasized the failure and collapse of the republican dream by the 1920s. Sardica summarizes the consensus of historians:\n:within a few years, large parts of the key economic forces, intellectuals, opinion-makers and middle classes changed from left to right, trading the unfulfilled utopia of a developing and civic republicanism for notions of \"order,\" \"stability\" and \"security\". For many who had helped, supported or simply cheered the Republic in 1910, hoping that the new political situation would repair the monarchy\u2019s flaws (government instability, financial crisis, economic backwardness and civic anomie), the conclusion to be drawn, in the 1920s, was that the remedy for national maladies called for much more than the simple removal of the king....The First Republic collapsed and died as a result of the confrontation between raised hopes and meager deeds.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardica, \"The Memory of the Portuguese First Republic throughout the Twentieth Century\" (2011) ''E-Journal of Portuguese History'' (Summer 2011) 9#1 pp 1\u201327. [http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/html/issue17/pdf/v9n1a04.pdf online]</ref>\n\nSardica, however, also points out the permanent impact of the republican experiment:\n:Despite its overall failure, the First Republic endowed twentieth-century Portugal with an insurpassable and enduring legacy\u2014a renewed civil law, the basis for an educational revolution, the principle of separation between State and Church, the overseas empire (only brought to an end in 1975), and a strong symbolic culture whose materializations (the national flag, the national anthem and the naming of streets) nobody has dared to alter and which still define the present-day collective identity of the Portuguese. The Republic\u2019s prime legacy was indeed that of memory.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardica, \"The Memory of the Portuguese First Republic throughout the Twentieth Century\" (2011)</ref>\n\n=== 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n\n{{Main|28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\n[[File:Desfile de tropas 28 de Maio 1926.jpg|thumb|[[Gomes da Costa]] and his troops march victorious into Lisbon on 6 June 1926.]]\nBy the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour another authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Since the opposition's constitutional route to power was blocked by the various means deployed by the PRP to protect itself, it turned to the army for support. The political awareness of the armed forces had grown during the war, and many of their leaders had not forgiven the PRP for sending them to a war they did not want to fight.<ref name=\"Ferreira, 1992a\">Ferreira, 1992a</ref>\n\nThey seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of \u2018order\u2019 against the \u2018chaos\u2019 that was taking over the country. Links were established between conservative figures and military officers, who added their own political and corporative demands to the already complex equation. The [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]] enjoyed the support of most army units and even of most political parties. As had been the case in December 1917, the population of Lisbon did not rise to defend the Republic, leaving it at the mercy of the army.<ref name=\"Ferreira, 1992a\" />\n\nThere are few global and up-to-date studies of this turbulent third phase of the Republic's existence.<ref>Marques, 1973</ref><ref>Telo, 1980</ref><ref>Telo, 1984</ref> Nevertheless, much has been written about the crisis and fall of the regime and the 28 May movement.<ref name=\"Pinto, 2000\" /><ref>Cruz, 1986</ref><ref>Cabral, 1993</ref><ref>Rosas, 1997</ref><ref>Martins, 1998</ref><ref>Afonso, 2001</ref> The First Republic continues to be the subject of an intense debate. A historiographical balance sheet by Armando Malheiro da Silva (2000) identifies three main interpretations. For some historians the First Republic was a progressive and increasingly democratic regime. For others it was essentially a prolongation of the liberal and elitist regimes of the 19th century. A third group chooses to highlight the regime's revolutionary, Jacobin and dictatorial nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n== Estado Novo (1933\u20131974) ==\n{{Main|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|upright|Portuguese colonies in Africa by the time of the Colonial War.]]\n\n=== Salazar dictatorship ===\nPolitical chaos, several strikes, harsh relations with the Church, and considerable economic problems aggravated by a disastrous [[Portugal in the Great War|military intervention in the First World War]] led to the military [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]]. This coup installed the \"Second Republic\", which started as the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) and became the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' (New State) in 1933, led by economist [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]]. He transformed Portugal into a sort of [[Fascist]] regime that evolved into a single-party [[Fascist corporatism|corporative]] regime. Portugal, although neutral, informally aided the Nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339).\n\nSalazar's policy after the war was to provide a certain level of [[liberalization]] in politics, in terms of organized opposition with more [[freedom of the press]]. Opposition parties were tolerated to an extent, but they were also controlled, limited, and manipulated, with the result that they split into factions and never formed a united opposition.<ref>Dawn L.

Lisbon, maintaining air connections with Britain and the U.S., became a hotbed of spies of several war parties and served as the base for the International Red Cross in its distribution of relief supplies to POWs.\n\n=== Colonies ===\n\nIn 1961, the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony in Goa against an Indian invasion (see [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]). The operations resulted in a Portuguese defeat and the loss of the colonies in [[India]]. Independence movements also became active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]; the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] started. Some 122,000 Africans died in the conflict.<ref>Clodfelter 2017: 561</ref> Portugal, during this period, was never an outcast, and was a founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA).\n\nAfter the death of Salazar in 1970, his replacement by [[Marcelo Caetano]] offered a certain hope that the regime would open up, the ''primavera marcelista'' (Marcelist spring). However the colonial wars in Africa continued, [[political prisoner]]s remained incarcerated, freedom of association was not restored, [[censorship]] was only slightly eased and the [[election]]s remained tightly controlled.\n\nThe regime retained its characteristic traits: censorship, corporativeness, with a market economy dominated by a handful of economical groups, continuous surveillance and intimidation of several sectors of society through the use of a political police and techniques instilling fear (such as arbitrary imprisonment, systematic political persecution and even assassination of anti-regime insurgents).\n\n== The Third Republic (1974\u2013) ==\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso|Third Portuguese Republic}}\nThe \"[[Carnation Revolution]]\" of April 25, 1974, an effectively bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the \"Third Republic\".

This period was marked by political turmoil, violence, and instability, and the nationalization of industries. Portugal was polarized between the conservative north, with its many independent small farmers, and the radical south, where communists helped peasants seize control of large estates. Finally, in the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 legislative election]], the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] came in first in elections and its leader [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] formed Portugal's first democratically-elected government in nearly a half century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Judt|title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10oPnprPjcgC&pg=PA515|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=513\u201315|isbn=9780143037750}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] and its center-right allies under Prime Minister [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]] gained control of parliament in 1987 and 1991 while the Socialist Party and its allies succeeded in the 1991 presidential election to retain the presidency for its popular leader Mario Soares.<ref name=\"Goldey1992\">{{cite journal |last1=Goldey |first1=David B. |title=The Portuguese elections of 1987 and 1991 and the presidential election of 1991 |journal=Electoral Studies |date=June 1992 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=171\u2013176 |doi=10.1016/0261-3794(92)90039-9 }}</ref>\n\n=== Violent decolonisation ===\nIn 1975, Portugal granted independence to its [[Portuguese Empire|Overseas Provinces]] (''Prov\u00edncias Ultramarinas'' in Portuguese) in Africa ([[Portuguese Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Portuguese Cape Verde]] and [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]]).
