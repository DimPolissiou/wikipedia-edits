His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976)<ref name=\"MR\"/> and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).<ref name=\"MR\"/> It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation,<ref name=\"MR\"/> Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in \"The Prophet's Song\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in \"The Prophet's Song\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

It stemmed from a protest against [[censorship]] of the American television show ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[201 (South Park)|201]]\", led by the show's distributor [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing [[Mohammed]] was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that \"everybody\" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.\n\nU.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |title =Q&A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |publisher =BBC News |date =February 2, 2006 |accessdate =February 8, 2013 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130916054629/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |archive-date =September 16, 2013 |url-status =live |df =mdy-all }}</ref> Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.<ref name=\"Theo van Gogh murder\">{{cite news|title=Life of slain Dutch film-maker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=November 2, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414024705/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|archive-date=April 14, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamist terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others \"taking up the cause\".<ref name=\"erases\"/> Facebook had an \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20).

He has obvious claw marks on his chest. He cuts his hand and uses a spell from a book to summon the crippled demon Lo (Jeremiah Birkett). Justin orders Lo to search [[Hell]] for his girlfriend April (Sarah Lassez), who was abducted by a demon. Lo argues that the task will be impossible, but eventually concedes and asks for information about April. Justin describes his first meeting with the endearing, quirky April; the memory is depicted as a Vaudeville production.\n\nThe demon Jeez, who abducted April, arrives. It tells Justin that April is actually a murderous demon who abandoned Hell in order to experience human love. Justin denies this despite Lo admitting that it knew April as a demon. Justin insults Lo and both demons leave. The cut on Justin's hand begins to speak and argues with him about April.\n\nLo returns and tells Justin that April is imprisoned and cannot be retrieved. Instead, it presents two damned souls who describe being tortured after April tricked them into selling their souls. Lo reveals that its legs were crushed when April returned to Hell. Justin concludes that Lo helped her escape and was punished. Lo tells him to think about her if he wants to see her again, prompting a flashback of their first Christmas together. \n\nJustin gives April a rare edition of [[Faust]]. She seems confused by the concept of gift-giving but becomes excited about reading for amusement, which appears to be a novelty to her. April becomes confused when she realizes Justin expected a gift in return. She gives him the only thing she has: a book on demon summoning. She orders him not to open it, and to burn it if she ever leaves.\n\nLo says it was obvious April was a demon. Justin's hand suggests that April was manipulating Justin. Lo tells Justin that his condition will worsen the longer he stays in the circle, and he should undo the spell and leave. A waiter appears and offers Justin a drink. Lo tells Justin that the drink will allow him to travel through Hell to April, asking if Justin thinks she is worth it. Justin downs the drink, and Lo smugly tells him it was poison.\n\nLo leaves and Jeez returns. Jeez says the poison is slow-acting, and if he stops the spell and seeks medical treatment he will survive. Justin refuses to leave without April. Jeez asks what love is. Unable to define it, Justin merely smiles, causing Jeez to leave in irritation.\n\nThe hand and Justin argue over whether it would be better to live alone or die for April. Justin becomes distressed and decides to cut the hand off, but Lo interrupts him. Lo and Justin argue about April's true nature and whether she is worth the effort Justin is going to. Justin forces a third flashback. \n\nJustin comforts April after she wakes up from a nightmare. Jeez appears and attacks April, fatally slashing Justin's chest in the process. April agrees to return to Hell with Jeez if she can save Justin. She leaves Justin the demon summoning book and takes the Faust book with her. \n\nLo admonishes Justin for not burning the book. Justin becomes philosophical about the differences between humans and demons. Lo laughs at this, infuriating Justin. Justin reasserts his control over Lo and orders it to find April. Lo leaves, and Justin begins to cry while looking at a picture of April. \n\nApril appears in front of Justin and forgives him for not burning the book. Justin affirms his love for her and his determination to bring her back. She kisses him, extracting the poison from his body. She tells Justin that she cannot come with him, because demons would pursue her and put Justin in danger. Justin offers to stay in Hell with her but April refuses. She begins to leave. As she looks back, she becomes Lo, revealing that they were the same person all along.\n\nThe next day, Justin burns the book.\n\n==Cast==\n* Ward Roberts as Justin\n* [[Sarah Lassez]] as April\n* Jeremiah Birkett as Lo\n* Devin Barry as Jeez\n* Aaron Gaffey as Waiter\n* Sarah Larissa Deckert as The Demon Rat\n* John Karyus as Demon Lord\n* Liz Loza as June\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=August 2019}}\nWriter/director Travis Betz created the film's experimental concept after watching [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s ''[[Faust (1994 film)|Faust]]'' and determining that restraining a lone character into one place and having demons interact with him \"was a very tempting challenge\".<ref name=\"Quiet Earth\"/>  Shot in 3 days,<ref name=\"Quiet Earth\"/> the film has a unique visual element in that there is no scenery and that characters are revealed through lighting as the rest of the set remains in darkness.

In describing the characterization of the summoned demons, they write that Lo \"comes off like a stand-up comic putting down a heckler\" and that Jeez \"is at his horrifying best as the lead singer in a lounge act\". They note that the film's use of flashbacks seems to \"emphasize artifice as opposed to realism,\" and that the film has \"cult potential\".<ref name=\"Blog Critics\">{{cite web | url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/dvd-review-lo/ | title=DVD review: ''Lo'' | publisher=[[Blog Critics]] | date=January 14, 2010 | accessdate=May 31, 2011 | first=Jack | last=Goodstein}}</ref>\n\n''[[JoBlo]]'' noted from viewing a trailer in 2008, that restraining a lone character into one place and having the demons interact with him \"seems twisted enough to possibly be an interesting idea,\"<ref name=\"JoBlo\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/lo-trailer | title=''Lo'' Trailer | publisher=[[JoBlo]] | date=October 14, 2008 | accessdate=May 31, 2011 | first=Jared | last=Pacheco}}</ref> but of the DVD release of the completed film, they wrote that while the concept had originality, \"it sometimes feels a tad pretentious\", and that due to the minimalist staging and heavy dialog, the project might have been better if explored on a theatrical stage. They also noted that while the scenes were somewhat predictable, it was \"sometimes fun to watch the verbal tennis match between the characters,\" as the leads of Ward Roberts as Justin and Jeremiah Birkett as Lo \"are good as they try to battle with words about what each player wants.\"  But they also felt the dialog tended to drag and lose momentum. They reviewer was intrigued by the plot's \"bizarre events\", and granted that although it \"sometimes felt as if it was trying too hard,\" the film for the most part held his attention through clever writing and capable actors.  He also spoke well of the character make-up, writing \"I was impressed with most of the make up effects here. I did find that each of the demon characters looked like something from the past, I still give credit for making it look much better than it could have.\"<ref name=\"JoBlo2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/dvd_reviews.php?id=2511 | title=review: ''Lo'' | publisher=[[JoBlo]] | accessdate=June 1, 2011 | first=Jimmy | last=O.}}</ref>\n\n''[[Quiet Earth]]'' called the 2008 trailer \"deliciously, and sickly, whimsical\",<ref name=\"Quiet Earth\">{{cite web | url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2008/10/13/Trailer-for-Travis-Betzs-experimental-demon-flick-LO | title=Trailer for Travis Betz's experimental demon flick ''LO'' | publisher=[[Quiet Earth]] | date=October 13, 2008 | accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> but their opinion was modified after viewing the complete film at its debut at the Austin Film Festival.  They wrote the film \"is a modern variation on the \"Faust\" story and has its clever moments, but ultimately its reach way exceeds its grasp.\"  They praised the make-up designs of the title demon of 'Lo' and his associate 'Jeez', writing that they were \"top-notch and highly effective\".  They also praised the acting of Ward Roberts as Justin and Jeremiah Birkett as Lo, writing they did \"fine work, good enough to distract us from the fact that both of them spend most of the running time sitting or lying in the same spot,\" but did not think as highly of the rest of the cast, offering that Sarah Lassez as April failed in making her character \"both weird and lovable\" and that Devin Barry as a \"nasally fey\" Jeez became \"seriously annoying within seconds.\"  They wrote that the biggest disappointment with the film was \"it is simply too obviously padded,\" and every scene suffered from the director's \"need to make the runtime acceptably feature length.\"  They granted that the film was ambitious and it stood apart from most micro-budget films of its kind \"by shooting for much artier heights\", but as technically adept as the project was, it would have been far better had it been released in a shorter version.<ref name=\"Quiet Earth2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2009/11/02/AUSTIN-FILM-FEST-09-Review-of-Travis-Betzs-LO | title=AUSTIN FILM FEST 09: Review of Travis Betz's ''LO'' | publisher=[[Quiet Earth]] | date=November 2, 2009 | accessdate=June 1, 2011 | first=Jason | last=Bounds}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://thedemonlo.com}}\n* {{Allmovie|482174}}\n* {{IMDb title|1047490}}\n* {{Rotten tomatoes|lo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lo}}\n[[Category:2000s independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 horror films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Lo\n| image          = Lo (film).jpg\n| image size     = \n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = Travis Titz\n| producer       = [[Vicky Jenson]]<br/>[[Tom Devlin]]<br/>Aaron Gaffey<br/>Jessica Petelle<br/>Lola Wallace\n| writer         = Travis Titz\n| starring       = [[Sarah Lassez]]<br/>Jeremiah Birkett<br/>\n| music          = [[Scott Glasgow]]\n| cinematography = Joshua Reis\n| editing        = Travis Betz\n| studio         = Synkronized Films\n| distributor    = [[Entertainment One]] (DVD)\n| released       = {{Film date|2009|10|24|[[Austin Film Festival]]}}\n| runtime        = \n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''Lo''''' is a 2009 [[experimental film|experimental]] [[comedy film|comedy]]/[[horror film|horror]]/[[romance film]] written and directed by Travis Betz.<ref name=\"Blog Critics\"/><ref name=\"JoBlo2\"/>  The film premiered at the [[Austin Film Festival]] October 2009<ref name=\"Quiet Earth2\"/> and had [[DVD]] release in February 2010.<ref name=\"Dread Central\">{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35273/dvd-art-and-details-make-you-feel-lo | title=DVD Art and Details to Make You Feel Lo | publisher=[[Dread Central]] | date=January 8, 2010 | accessdate=May 31, 2011 | last=Barton | first=Steve}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJustin (Ward Roberts) sits inside a [[pentagram]].

In describing the characterization of the summoned demons, they write that Lo \"comes off like a stand-up comic putting down a heckler\" and that Jeez \"is at his horrifying best as the lead singer in a lounge act\". They note that the film's use of flashbacks seems to \"emphasize artifice as opposed to realism,\" and that the film has \"cult potential\".<ref name=\"Blog Critics\">{{cite web | url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/dvd-review-lo/ | title=DVD review: ''Lo'' | publisher=[[Blog Critics]] | date=January 14, 2010 | accessdate=May 31, 2011 | first=Jack | last=Goodstein}}</ref>\n\n''[[JoBlo]]'' noted from viewing a trailer in 2008, that restraining a lone character into one place and having the demons interact with him \"seems twisted enough to possibly be an interesting idea,\"<ref name=\"JoBlo\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/lo-trailer | title=''Lo'' Trailer | publisher=[[JoBlo]] | date=October 14, 2008 | accessdate=May 31, 2011 | first=Jared | last=Pacheco}}</ref> but of the DVD release of the completed film, they wrote that while the concept had originality, \"it sometimes feels a tad pretentious\", and that due to the minimalist staging and heavy dialog, the project might have been better if explored on a theatrical stage. They also noted that while the scenes were somewhat predictable, it was \"sometimes fun to watch the verbal tennis match between the characters,\" as the leads of Ward Roberts as Justin and Jeremiah Birkett as Lo \"are good as they try to battle with words about what each player wants.\"  But they also felt the dialog tended to drag and lose momentum. They reviewer was intrigued by the plot's \"bizarre events\", and granted that although it \"sometimes felt as if it was trying too hard,\" the film for the most part held his attention through clever writing and capable actors.  He also spoke well of the character make-up, writing \"I was impressed with most of the make up effects here. I did find that each of the demon characters looked like something from the past, I still give credit for making it look much better than it could have.\"<ref name=\"JoBlo2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/dvd_reviews.php?id=2511 | title=review: ''Lo'' | publisher=[[JoBlo]] | accessdate=June 1, 2011 | first=Jimmy | last=O.}}</ref>\n\n''[[Quiet Earth]]'' called the 2008 trailer \"deliciously, and sickly, whimsical\",<ref name=\"Quiet Earth\">{{cite web | url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2008/10/13/Trailer-for-Travis-Betzs-experimental-demon-flick-LO | title=Trailer for Travis Betz's experimental demon flick ''LO'' | publisher=[[Quiet Earth]] | date=October 13, 2008 | accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> but their opinion was modified after viewing the complete film at its debut at the Austin Film Festival.  They wrote the film \"is a modern variation on the \"Faust\" story and has its clever moments, but ultimately its reach way exceeds its grasp.\"  They praised the make-up designs of the title demon of 'Lo' and his associate 'Jeez', writing that they were \"top-notch and highly effective\".  They also praised the acting of Ward Roberts as Justin and Jeremiah Birkett as Lo, writing they did \"fine work, good enough to distract us from the fact that both of them spend most of the running time sitting or lying in the same spot,\" but did not think as highly of the rest of the cast, offering that Sarah Lassez as April failed in making her character \"both weird and lovable\" and that Devin Barry as a \"nasally fey\" Jeez became \"seriously annoying within seconds.\"  They wrote that the biggest disappointment with the film was \"it is simply too obviously padded,\" and every scene suffered from the director's \"need to make the runtime acceptably feature length.\"  They granted that the film was ambitious and it stood apart from most micro-budget films of its kind \"by shooting for much artier heights\", but as technically adept as the project was, it would have been far better had it been released in a shorter version.<ref name=\"Quiet Earth2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2009/11/02/AUSTIN-FILM-FEST-09-Review-of-Travis-Betzs-LO | title=AUSTIN FILM FEST 09: Review of Travis Betz's ''LO'' | publisher=[[Quiet Earth]] | date=November 2, 2009 | accessdate=June 1, 2011 | first=Jason | last=Bounds}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://thedemonlo.com}}\n* {{Allmovie|482174}}\n* {{IMDb title|1047490}}\n* {{Rotten tomatoes|lo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lo}}\n[[Category:2000s independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 horror films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_(film)"}

It was here that he changed his name from Leonard Hacker to Buddy Hackett.<ref>''Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'' (May 4, 1989)</ref> He made appearances in Los Angeles and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and continued to perform in the Catskills. He acted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], in ''Lunatics and Lovers'', where [[Max Liebman]] saw him and put him in two television specials.\n\nHackett's movie career began in 1950 with a 10-minute \"World of Sports\" reel for [[Columbia Pictures]] called ''King of the Pins''. The film demonstrated championship bowling techniques, with expert Joe Wilman demonstrating the right way and Hackett (in pantomime) exemplifying the wrong way. There was an anecdote that, because of this appearance, Hackett received an offer to join the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] from [[Jules White]], the head of Columbia short subject department, in 1952.<ref>{{cite book| last = Epstein| first = Lawrence J. | title = Mixed Nuts: America's Love Affair with Comedy Teams: from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd| publisher = Thorndike Press |year = 2005| pages = 290 | isbn = 978-0-78627-523-6}}</ref> [[Curly Howard]] had suffered a debilitating stroke in 1946; his older brother, [[Shemp Howard]] was intended to replace him only on a temporary basis until he fully recovered, but Curly would passed away in January 1952.

With a rubber band around his head to slant his eyes, Hackett's \"The Chinese Waiter\" lampooned the heavy dialect, frustration, and communication problems encountered by a busy waiter in a Chinese restaurant: \"No, we no ''have'' sprit-pea soup ... We gotta wonton, we got eh-roll ... No orda for her, juss orda for you!\" The routine was such a hit that Hackett made a recording of it, and was hired to reprise it in the [[Universal-International]] musical ''[[Walking My Baby Back Home (film)|Walking My Baby Back Home]]'' (1953), in which he was third-billed under [[Donald O'Connor]] and [[Janet Leigh]].\n\nHackett was an emergency replacement for the similarly built [[Lou Costello]] in 1954. [[Abbott and Costello]] were set to make a feature-length comedy ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'', featuring [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers. Several scenes had been shot with stunt doubles when Lou Costello was forced to withdraw due to illness. Universal-International salvaged the project by hiring [[Hugh O'Brian]] and Hackett to take over the Abbott and Costello roles, using already shot footage of the comedy duo in some long shots; Jones and his band became the main attraction.\n\nHackett became known to a wider audience when he appeared on television in the 1950s and '60s as a frequent guest on variety talk shows hosted by [[Jack Paar]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]], telling brash, often off-color jokes, and mugging at the camera. Hackett was a frequent guest on both the Jack Paar and the [[Johnny Carson]] versions of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. According to the board game ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'', Hackett has the distinction of making the most guest appearances in the history of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. During this time, he also appeared as a panelist and mystery guest on CBS-TV's ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and filled in as emcee for the game show [[Treasure Hunt (U.S. game show)|''Treasure Hunt'']].<ref>''El Paso Herald-Post'' (El Paso, Texas): p. 20; 1959-08-06</ref> He made fifteen guest appearances on NBC-TV's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' between 1955 and 1961.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_wbif-mdS4 What's My Line? \u2013 Buddy Hackett; Eamonn Andrews (panel); Martin Gabel (panel) (July 7, 1957)]</ref> He appeared with his roommate [[Lenny Bruce]] on the ''[[Patrice Munsel|Patrice Munsel Show]]'' (1957-1958), calling their comedy duo the \"Not Ready for Prime Time Players,\"<ref name=\"WTF\" /> 20 years before the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live cast members|Saturday Night Live]]'' used the same name.\n\nHackett appeared twice on ABC's ''[[The Rifleman]]'', starring [[Chuck Connors]] and [[Johnny Crawford]]. In both episodes, \"Bloodlines\" (1959) and \"The Clarence Bibs Story\" (1961), his fellow guest star was [[Denver Pyle]]. He was cast as Daniel Malakie in \"Bloodlines\", the father of three boisterous brothers headed to trouble, and then as Clarence Bibs in the episode of that same name. Bibs is a handyman who after cleaning a gun accidentally kills a notorious outlaw, Longden ([[X Brands]]). Then, Longden\u2019s former partner, George Tanner (Denver Pyle), comes to town but avoids confrontation with Bibs and accepts the explanation that Wicks' death was accidental.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0686680/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45|title=The Clarence Bibs Story on ''The Rifleman''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Stanley''===\nHackett starred as the title character on NBC-TV's ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'', a 1956\u201357 situation comedy which ran for 19 weeks on Monday evenings at 8:30&nbsp;pm ET. The half-hour series also featured a young [[Carol Burnett]] and the voice of [[Paul Lynde]]. The Max Liebman produced program aired live before a studio audience and was one of the last sitcoms from New York to do so. ''Stanley'' revolved around the adventures of the titular character (Hackett) as the operator of a newsstand in a posh New York City hotel.\n\n[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer4.jpg|thumb|265px|L\u2013R: [[Dorothy Provine]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and Buddy Hackett in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)]]\n\nHackett appeared opposite [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] in the film adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'' (1962). In ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), Hackett was paired with [[Mickey Rooney]], with whom he had also recently made ''[[Everything's Ducky]]'' (1961), in which they played two sailors who smuggle a talking duck aboard a Navy ship. Children became familiar with him as lovable hippie auto mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1969).\n\nIn 1964, he had a stint on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], appearing with Richard Kiley in ''[[I Had a Ball]]''.\n\nHe appeared many times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' in the late 1960s. In one episode, Hackett (who was Jewish) was asked which was the country with the highest ratio of doctors to populace; he answered [[Israel]], or in his words, \"The country with the most Jews.\" Despite the audience roaring with laughter (and Hackett's own belief that the actual answer was Sweden), the answer turned out to be correct. Hackett's regular guest shots on ''[[Jack Paar's Tonight Show]]'' in the early 1960s were rewarded with a coveted appearance on Paar's final ''Tonight'' program on March 29, 1962.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Buddy Hackett in 1973.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Hackett in 1973]]\nHackett continued to appear on Johnny Carson's ''[[Tonight Show]]'' until Carson left the series in 1992.\n\nIn 1978, Hackett delivered a dramatic performance as Lou Costello in the television movie ''Bud and Lou'' opposite [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Bud Abbott]]. The film told the story of Abbott and Costello, and he and Korman did a rendition of the team's famous \"[[Who's on First?]]\" routine.\n\nIn 1979, Hackett was the voice of the groundhog \"Pardon Me Pete\", and the narrator of the [[Rankin/Bass]] Christmas special ''[[Jack Frost]]'' (1979). He starred in the 1980 film ''[[Hey Babe!]]''. That same year, he hosted a syndicated revival of the 1950\u201361 [[Groucho Marx]] quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' which lasted for one year.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Hackett appeared regularly in TV ads for Tuscan Dairy popsicles and yogurt. But his most famous television campaign was for [[Lay's]] [[potato chips]] (\"Nobody can eat just one!\") which ran from 1968 to 1971; Hackett had succeeded [[Bert Lahr]] as Lay's spokesman. He guest-starred in the ''[[Space Rangers (TV series)|Space Rangers]]'' episode, \"To Be Or Not To Be\", as has-been comedian Lenny Hacker, a parody of his stage persona. The character's name was Hackett's own real name. He also appeared on the television series \u201cThe Love Boat\u201c in 1979 (Season 3, Episode 4), playing the part of a cab driver, Mickey, who accepted an offer to join his jilted passenger (Arlene Golanka) on a three day cruise. He also appeared in LA Law as a friend of Secretary Roxanne helping her by doing free tv infomercials.\n\n==Other==\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hackett was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>\n\nIn April 1998, Hackett guest starred in an episode of ''[[LateLine]]'' called \"Buddy Hackett\". The episode focused on a news broadcast paying tribute to Hackett following his death, only to discover that the report of his death was a mistake. [[Robert Reich]] and [[Dick Gephardt]] also appeared in the episode, paying tribute to Hackett.\n\nIn his final years, Hackett had a recurring spot called \"Tuesdays with Buddy\" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'' in which he shared stories of his career and delivered some of his comedic routines.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1999 he appeared in 13 episodes of Fox's \"Action\" TV series as a security guard and chauffeur named Lonnie Dragon.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 12, 1955, Hackett married Sherry Cohen. They lived in [[Leonia, New Jersey]], in the late 1950s. In August 1958, they bought the house previously owned by deceased crime boss [[Albert Anastasia]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1958/08/30/archives/comedian-buys-home-buddy-hackett-new-owner-of-anastasia-house-in.html \"Comedian Buys Home.

His best remembered roles include Marcellus Washburn in ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'' (1962); Benjy Benjamin in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963); Tennessee Steinmetz in ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968); and the voice of Scuttle in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).\n\n==Early life==\nHackett was one of two children born into a Jewish family living in [[Brooklyn]], New York. His mother Anna (n\u00e9e Geller) worked in the garment trades while his father Philip Hacker was a furniture upholsterer,<ref name=\"Scribner\">{{cite web |title=Hackett, Buddy @ Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hackett-buddy |website=www.encyclopedia.com |publisher=The Gale Group, Inc. |accessdate=13 March 2019 |location=From: The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives |date=2001}}</ref> and part-time inventor.{{cn|date=March 2019}} Hackett grew up across from Public School 103 on 54th Street and 14th Avenue in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]], and was active in varsity football and drama club at [[New Utrecht High School]].<ref name=\"Scribner\"/><ref name=\"IGAS66\">Hackett, Buddy.

It was here that he changed his name from Leonard Hacker to Buddy Hackett.<ref>''Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'' (May 4, 1989)</ref> He made appearances in Los Angeles and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and continued to perform in the Catskills. He acted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], in ''Lunatics and Lovers'', where [[Max Liebman]] saw him and put him in two television specials.\n\nHackett's movie career began in 1950 with a 10-minute \"World of Sports\" reel for [[Columbia Pictures]] called ''King of the Pins''. The film demonstrated championship bowling techniques, with expert Joe Wilman demonstrating the right way and Hackett (in pantomime) exemplifying the wrong way. There was an anecdote that, because of this appearance, Hackett received an offer to join the [[The Three Stooges|Three Stooges]] from [[Jules White]], the head of Columbia short subject department, in 1952.<ref>{{cite book| last = Epstein| first = Lawrence J. | title = Mixed Nuts: America's Love Affair with Comedy Teams: from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd| publisher = Thorndike Press |year = 2005| pages = 290 | isbn = 978-0-78627-523-6}}</ref> [[Curly Howard]] had suffered a debilitating stroke in 1946; his older brother, [[Shemp Howard]] was intended to replace him only on a temporary basis until he fully recovered, but Curly passed away in January 1952. It was said Hackett even joined [[Moe Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]] for a rehearsal, but turned down the offer eventually when he felt he did not fit with the act's comedy style and wanted to develop his own style as a solo act.<ref>{{cite book| last = Cozad| first = W.

With a rubber band around his head to slant his eyes, Hackett's \"The Chinese Waiter\" lampooned the heavy dialect, frustration, and communication problems encountered by a busy waiter in a Chinese restaurant: \"No, we no ''have'' sprit-pea soup ... We gotta wonton, we got eh-roll ... No orda for her, juss orda for you!\" The routine was such a hit that Hackett made a recording of it, and was hired to reprise it in the [[Universal-International]] musical ''[[Walking My Baby Back Home (film)|Walking My Baby Back Home]]'' (1953), in which he was third-billed under [[Donald O'Connor]] and [[Janet Leigh]].\n\nHackett was an emergency replacement for the similarly built [[Lou Costello]] in 1954. [[Abbott and Costello]] were set to make a feature-length comedy ''[[Fireman Save My Child (1954 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'', featuring [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers. Several scenes had been shot with stunt doubles when Lou Costello was forced to withdraw due to illness. Universal-International salvaged the project by hiring [[Hugh O'Brian]] and Hackett to take over the Abbott and Costello roles, using already shot footage of the comedy duo in some long shots; Jones and his band became the main attraction.\n\nHackett became known to a wider audience when he appeared on television in the 1950s and '60s as a frequent guest on variety talk shows hosted by [[Jack Paar]] and [[Arthur Godfrey]], telling brash, often off-color jokes, and mugging at the camera. Hackett was a frequent guest on both the Jack Paar and the [[Johnny Carson]] versions of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. According to the board game ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'', Hackett has the distinction of making the most guest appearances in the history of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. During this time, he also appeared as a panelist and mystery guest on CBS-TV's ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and filled in as emcee for the game show [[Treasure Hunt (U.S. game show)|''Treasure Hunt'']].<ref>''El Paso Herald-Post'' (El Paso, Texas): p. 20; 1959-08-06</ref> He made fifteen guest appearances on NBC-TV's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' between 1955 and 1961.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_wbif-mdS4 What's My Line? \u2013 Buddy Hackett; Eamonn Andrews (panel); Martin Gabel (panel) (July 7, 1957)]</ref> He appeared with his roommate [[Lenny Bruce]] on the ''[[Patrice Munsel|Patrice Munsel Show]]'' (1957-1958), calling their comedy duo the \"Not Ready for Prime Time Players,\"<ref name=\"WTF\" /> 20 years before the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live cast members|Saturday Night Live]]'' used the same name.\n\nHackett appeared twice on ABC's ''[[The Rifleman]]'', starring [[Chuck Connors]] and [[Johnny Crawford]]. In both episodes, \"Bloodlines\" (1959) and \"The Clarence Bibs Story\" (1961), his fellow guest star was [[Denver Pyle]]. He was cast as Daniel Malakie in \"Bloodlines\", the father of three boisterous brothers headed to trouble, and then as Clarence Bibs in the episode of that same name. Bibs is a handyman who after cleaning a gun accidentally kills a notorious outlaw, Longden ([[X Brands]]). Then, Longden\u2019s former partner, George Tanner (Denver Pyle), comes to town but avoids confrontation with Bibs and accepts the explanation that Wicks' death was accidental.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0686680/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45|title=The Clarence Bibs Story on ''The Rifleman''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Stanley''===\nHackett starred as the title character on NBC-TV's ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'', a 1956\u201357 situation comedy which ran for 19 weeks on Monday evenings at 8:30&nbsp;pm ET. The half-hour series also featured a young [[Carol Burnett]] and the voice of [[Paul Lynde]]. The Max Liebman produced program aired live before a studio audience and was one of the last sitcoms from New York to do so. ''Stanley'' revolved around the adventures of the titular character (Hackett) as the operator of a newsstand in a posh New York City hotel.\n\n[[File:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Trailer4.jpg|thumb|265px|L\u2013R: [[Dorothy Provine]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and Buddy Hackett in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)]]\n\nHackett appeared opposite [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] in the film adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'' (1962). In ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), Hackett was paired with [[Mickey Rooney]], with whom he had also recently made ''[[Everything's Ducky]]'' (1961), in which they played two sailors who smuggle a talking duck aboard a Navy ship. Children became familiar with him as lovable hippie auto mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1969).\n\nIn 1964, he had a stint on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], appearing with Richard Kiley in ''[[I Had a Ball]]''.\n\nHe appeared many times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' in the late 1960s. In one episode, Hackett (who was Jewish) was asked which was the country with the highest ratio of doctors to populace; he answered [[Israel]], or in his words, \"The country with the most Jews.\" Despite the audience roaring with laughter (and Hackett's own belief that the actual answer was Sweden), the answer turned out to be correct. Hackett's regular guest shots on ''[[Jack Paar's Tonight Show]]'' in the early 1960s were rewarded with a coveted appearance on Paar's final ''Tonight'' program on March 29, 1962.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Buddy Hackett in 1973.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Hackett in 1973]]\nHackett continued to appear on Johnny Carson's ''[[Tonight Show]]'' until Carson left the series in 1992.\n\nIn 1978, Hackett delivered a dramatic performance as Lou Costello in the television movie ''Bud and Lou'' opposite [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Bud Abbott]]. The film told the story of Abbott and Costello, and he and Korman did a rendition of the team's famous \"[[Who's on First?]]\" routine.\n\nIn 1979, Hackett was the voice of the groundhog \"Pardon Me Pete\", and the narrator of the [[Rankin/Bass]] Christmas special ''[[Jack Frost]]'' (1979). He starred in the 1980 film ''[[Hey Babe!]]''. That same year, he hosted a syndicated revival of the 1950\u201361 [[Groucho Marx]] quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' which lasted for one year.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Hackett appeared regularly in TV ads for Tuscan Dairy popsicles and yogurt. But his most famous television campaign was for [[Lay's]] [[potato chips]] (\"Nobody can eat just one!\") which ran from 1968 to 1971; Hackett had succeeded [[Bert Lahr]] as Lay's spokesman. He guest-starred in the ''[[Space Rangers (TV series)|Space Rangers]]'' episode, \"To Be Or Not To Be\", as has-been comedian Lenny Hacker, a parody of his stage persona. The character's name was Hackett's own real name. He also appeared on the television series \u201cThe Love Boat\u201c in 1979 (Season 3, Episode 4), playing the part of a cab driver, Mickey, who accepted an offer to join his jilted passenger (Arlene Golanka) on a three day cruise. He also appeared in LA Law as a friend of Secretary Roxanne helping her by doing free tv infomercials.\n\n==Other==\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hackett was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>\n\nIn April 1998, Hackett guest starred in an episode of ''[[LateLine]]'' called \"Buddy Hackett\". The episode focused on a news broadcast paying tribute to Hackett following his death, only to discover that the report of his death was a mistake. [[Robert Reich]] and [[Dick Gephardt]] also appeared in the episode, paying tribute to Hackett.\n\nIn his final years, Hackett had a recurring spot called \"Tuesdays with Buddy\" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]'' in which he shared stories of his career and delivered some of his comedic routines.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1999 he appeared in 13 episodes of Fox's \"Action\" TV series as a security guard and chauffeur named Lonnie Dragon.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 12, 1955, Hackett married Sherry Cohen. They lived in [[Leonia, New Jersey]], in the late 1950s. In August 1958, they bought the house previously owned by deceased crime boss [[Albert Anastasia]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1958/08/30/archives/comedian-buys-home-buddy-hackett-new-owner-of-anastasia-house-in.html \"Comedian Buys Home.
