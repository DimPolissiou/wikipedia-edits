As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |title=Story of Corporal William Jared |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514031518/http://www.bitsofblueandgray.com/readers.htm |archive-date=2008-05-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the Fifth Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. Later, for a time, the 123rd Illinois Infantry Regiment was attached to the mounted unit known as the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. It was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 4th Division, 14th Army Corps.\n\nThe regiment was mounted from May 1863 to November 1864.

Watanabe. It began serialization in the 12th issue of [[Akita Shoten]]\u2019s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' in 2008, and as of March 2019, the series has been compiled into 63 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. An anime television series adaptation aired from October 2013 to July 2014, followed by a second season aired from October 2014 to March 2015, a third season aired from January to June 2017 and a fourth season aired from January to June 2018. A live-action television drama adaptation aired in August 2016. A live-action film adaptation is set to release in August 2020.\n\nThe first two seasons have been licensed by [[Discotek Media]] in North America in 2014, and the manga has been licensed by [[Yen Press]] in 2015. Several new mangas continue to be published.\n\n==Plot==\nSakamichi Onoda is an [[otaku]] who has just entered high school. In middle school, Onoda did not have any friends with whom he could talk about his interests, and hopes to change that by joining his new school's anime club. However, he is crushed when he discovers the anime club has been disbanded due to lack of interest, and in order to reestablish the club, four new members must join.\n\nSince he was a little boy, Onoda has ridden his [[city bicycle]] (referred to as a \"mamachari\", meaning \"Mommy Bike\", in the anime)\u2014a simple and bulky bicycle designed for short rides\u2014for transportation and fun. A fellow freshman, and much more serious cyclist, named Shunsuke Imaizumi notices Onoda riding his mamachari and mocks him inwardly until he sees Onoda riding up a steep hill with little effort. Another student named Naruko visits [[Akihabara]] to get some plastic [[Gundam]] models for his younger brothers and meets Onoda, who catches his attention because of his cycling skill on the mamachari. Later on, both Naruko and Imaizumi try to convince him to join the bicycle racing club at their high school, Sohoku.\n\n==Teams and characters==\n\n===Sohoku High School===\nSohoku is a hard-working team that acts as the main school in the story. The team is characterized as being able to overcome internal conflicts and brutal training. For example, Sohoku hosts an intense and gruelling 1000&nbsp;km training camp every year to determine who will advance to the main race of the series, the Inter-High.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sakamichi Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u5742\u9053|Onoda Sakamichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Daiki Yamashita]]}}\n:Live action actor: [[Yuuki Ogoe]] (TV Series), Ren Nagase (Movie)\n:Onoda is the main protagonist of the series, a first-year high school student, and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. His personality is initially characterized as being a shy [[otaku]] with a difficulty in speaking up for himself. However, after joining the bicycle club, his confidence receives a dramatic boost, and the love and admiration he has for his fellow teammates becomes apparent. Since the very beginning of the series, Onoda shows steady stamina and high cadence abilities when riding uphill, and thus, the captain of the team, Kinjou, makes Onoda one of the team\u2019s climbers. To nurture Onoda\u2019s ability to climb for long periods of time, Kinjou assigns Makishima, a fellow climber and third-year, to tutor him. Onoda\u2019s best cycling ability, the team finds out, is that he performs best when chasing someone in the lead. When Onoda enters the Inter-High, he performs amazing feats for his team such as passing more than 100 cyclists after a crash and drafting Tadokoro, who was recovering from stomach pain, for almost 70km from the back of the race to the front where the rest of the team is.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shunsuke Imaizumi|\u4eca\u6cc9 \u4fca\u8f14|Imaizumi Shunsuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dsuke Toriumi]]}}\n:Live action actor: Tatsunari Kimura (TV Series), [[Kentaro Ito]] (Movie)\n:Imaizumi is a popular first-year high school student and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Imaizumi is a logical thinker with a generally dry personality, although, when entangled in certain situations, he can become quite frenzied and passionate. Because he dreams of one day becoming the fastest cyclist in the world, his cycling style is defined as an all-rounder. Because of Imaizumi\u2019s customarily coarse personality, his relationship with his teammates varies from person to person. For example, he has an intense rivalry with fellow teammate Naruko because of his sprinting abilities and overall attitude, likewise, he sees the captain, Kinjou, as his biggest obstacle. On the other hand, Imaizumi is seen being fairly gentle and kind towards Onoda.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shoukichi Naruko|\u9cf4\u5b50 \u7ae0\u5409|Naruko Sh\u014dkichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Jun Fukushima]]}}\n:Live action actor: Taiga Fukuzawa\n:Naruko is a first-year high school student from Osaka, and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Naruko\u2019s personality is sharp, spunky, and highly competitive, however, he takes cycling very seriously, and often gets very upset if he is defeated in a race, even if it is by another teammate. He is a high-energy sprinter, and his vitality often gets fueled by his mentor, Tadokoro, a fellow sprinter and third-year, who he affectionately refers to as \u201cold man.\u201d He maintains a friendly rivalry with Imaizumi, and is always supportive and caring towards Onoda.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shingo Kinjou|\u91d1\u57ce \u771f\u8b77|Kinj\u014d Shingo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Yasumoto]]}}\n:Live action actor: Naoya Goumoto\n:Kinjou is a sunglasses-wielding third-year high school student and captain of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. He is an all-rounder cyclist with an amazing iron will in addition to being Sohoku\u2019s ace. Kinjou comes off as having an icy personality, but throughout the series, he continuously shows that he has the best intentions for his team at heart. Kinjou works incredibly hard to bring out the best in everyone\u2019s cycling abilities, especially Imaizumi, who he considers his mentee.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuusuke Makishima|\u5dfb\u5cf6 \u88d5\u4ecb|Makishima Y\u016bsuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Showtaro Morikubo]]}}\n:Live action actor: Ry\u014dma Baba\n:Makishima is a third-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Team. Makishima is the ace climber of the team and has the nickname of \u201cPeak Spider\u201d due to his unusual dancing technique when cycling uphill. His generally awkward personality, in addition to his strange looks, makes Makishima seem unapproachable or even frightening. However, throughout the series, he offers wise advice to his mentee, Onoda, about cycling. Makishima is also well known for having a longtime, intimate rivalry with Hakone\u2019s ace climber, Toudou.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Jin Tadokoro|\u7530\u6240 \u8fc5|Tadokoro Jin}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kentar\u014d It\u014d]]}}\n:Live action actor: Y\u016bki Tomotsune\n:Tadokoro is a third-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Team. Despite his bulkiness, he is the team\u2019s ace sprinter, and oftentimes throughout the series, takes advantage of his large body to perform his signature riding style \u201cHuman Bullet Train,\u201d where he drafts wind for the team as they ride behind him. He is sometimes seen as the \u201cfatherly\u201d member of the team, having been a mentor to Naruko, Teshima, and Aoyagi.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Junta Teshima|\u624b\u5cf6 \u7d14\u592a|Teshima Junta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}\n:Live action actor: Kousuke Kujirai\n:Teshima is a second-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Teshima is an all-rounder rider who works as a duo with fellow teammate Aoyagi. During the 1000 km training camp, he injures his legs in the final stretch and loses to the first-years, thus losing a spot in the Inter-High. He has an outgoing, cheerful, yet serious personality that never fails to keep the other members in high spirits. Teshima is most noted for having a very close relationship with Aoyagi, a fellow second-year. He is often seen \u201creading Aoyagi\u2019s mind,\u201d and knowing how Aoyagi is feeling or what he wants without him having to speak or show facial expressions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hajime Aoyagi|\u9752\u516b\u6728 \u4e00|Aoyagi Hajime}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]]}}\n:Live action actor: Ry\u014d Yashima\n:Aoyagi is a second-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Aoyagi is an all-rounder rider who works as a duo with fellow teammate Teshima. He considers himself to be \u201cunskilled,\u201d but usually manages to claim first place in races with Teshima\u2019s help. However, like Teshima, he injures himself in the final stretch of the 1000 km training camp and loses a spot in the Inter-High. Aoyagi is a very quiet boy who spends most of his time with Teshima, however, it is not uncommon to see him grow more vocal in stressful situations.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Terufumi Sugimoto|\u6749\u5143 \u7167\u6587|Sugimoto Terufumi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]]}}\n:Live action actor: Hiroki Harai\n:Sugimoto is a first-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. He avidly claims to be an \u201cexperienced rider,\u201d and often offers advice to the fellow first-years. However, his actual skills are very slim, and he does not even fall into an all-rounder, climber, or sprinter category. His lack of skill becomes even more apparent when he fails to complete the 1000 km training camp because he refused to cycle in the rain. In the case of Onoda, Sugimoto's advice is given not out of ego but a genuine desire to be helpful. With Onoda being very new to the sport, Sugimoto's explanations of the basics greatly benefited him, for which he remains grateful for.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Koga Kimitaka|\u53e4\u8cc0 \u516c\u8cb4|Kimitaka Koga}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuuichi Nakamura]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kaburagi Issa|\u93d1\u6728 \u4e00\u5dee|Issa Kaburagi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiro Shimono]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sugimoto Sadatoki|\u6749\u5143 \u5b9a\u6642|Sadatoki Sugimoto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]}}\n:Sugimoto Sadatoki is Terufumi Sugimoto Younger Brother and is a first-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Danchiku Ryuuhou|\u6bb5\u7af9 \u7adc\u5305|Ry\u016bh\u014d Danchiku}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Wataru Hatano]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gorizou|\u30b4\u30ea\u8535|Goriz\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|Kanuka Mitsuaki}}\n\n===Hakone Academy===\n\nHakone Academy is the country's largest cycling team, and claims to be made up of \u201csix aces\u201d with many more in reserve. During the first year of the series, it was noted to have 50 club members. Since Hakone is such an expansive team, the selection process of who does, and does not, go to the Inter-High is quite complex. To determine who has the honor of participating in the Inter-High, all of the members race against each other, and only the winners of each group (A - F), are allowed to participate. Furthermore, these groups are divided so that the team takes three all-rounders, two climbers, and up to two sprinters to the Inter-High.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sangaku Manami|\u771f\u6ce2 \u5c71\u5cb3|Manami Sangaku}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]}}\n:Live action actor: [[Keisuke Ueda]]\n:Manami is a first-year high school student and a member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Manami is very easy-going and easily distracted by nature, cycling, and the feeling of complete freedom. He is the mentee climber to third-year, Toudou, and serves as Hakone\u2019s second climber during the Inter-High. Though for different reasons, Onoda and he have a similar joy for climbing hills and the two hit it off almost immediately as friends and competitors.  His most notable feature is that people hallucinate seeing wings on his back when he reaches his top speeds during a race. He accomplishes this by reading the wind conditions, then shifts upwards and dances when gusts come up from behind. His skill allowed him to win his club heats and join the Inter-High team, the first first-year to do so in the club's history.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Jinpachi Toudou|\u6771\u5802 \u5c3d\u516b|T\u014dd\u014d Jinpachi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]}}\n:Live action actor: Ryou Kitamura\n:Toudou is a popular third-year student and a member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Toudou is the ace climber of Hakone, and mentor to first-year, Manami. His climbing style is fast and silent, and combined with his good looks, gives him the nickname \u201cSleeping Beauty,\u201d as he manages to sneak up on cyclists in front of him and pass them without their knowledge. His personality is very pompous, and he thinks very highly of himself. Toudou has many female fans who tend to inflate his ego, however, his strong relationship with Sohoku\u2019s ace climber, Makishima, who he affectionately calls \u201cMaki-chan,\u201d tends to mellow him out again. Toudou is most often noted for his very intimate rivalry with Makishima.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Juichi Fukutomi|\u798f\u5bcc \u5bff\u4e00|Fukutomi Juichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}\n: Live action actor: [[Eiji Takigawa]]\n:Fukutomi is a third-year high school student and captain of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Fukutomi is an all-rounder and ace of the team. His serious, straightforward personality and unchanging expression has earned him the nickname \u201cIron Mask.\u201d In addition to being remembered as the ace of Hakone, he is known for getting distraught during a past race and injuring himself and Sohoku\u2019s Kinjou, with whom he has had a longtime rivalry. This makes him resolve to win against Sohoku in this years match, hoping it will be atonement for what he did. Throughout the Inter-High, he is often seen sporting his catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m strong.\u201d\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hayato Shinkai|\u65b0\u958b \u96bc\u4eba|Shinkai Hayato}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]]}}\n:Live action actor: Shuuto Miyazaki\n:Shinkai is a third-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Shinkai is the team\u2019s ace sprinter, and claims to have a \u201cmonster locked up inside of him\u201d that gets \u201creleased\u201d during especially stressful races. Shinkai\u2019s personality is usually relaxed and easy-going, and he is often seen with a power bar in his mouth and striking his signature \u201cbakyun!\u201d pose. In a past race, Shinkai ran over and killed a mother rabbit, leaving an orphaned kit who he then adopted. Because of his guilt, Shinkai stopped cycling for his team transiently, and became unable to pass other riders during races on the left side since that was what happened when he killed the rabbit. Although he is the ace sprinter, it was decided it would be best for him to not participate in the first sprinters race (first check point) during day one of the Inter high race and have Izumida represent their team during that day. Later he would race against Midousuji during the second one on the second day.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yasutomo Arakita|\u8352\u5317 \u9756\u53cb|Arakita Yasutomo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]}}\n:Live action actor: [[Hiroki Suzuki (born 1985)|Hiroki Suzuki]]\n:Arakita is a third-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Arakita is a skilled, albeit reckless, all-rounder cycler who was introduced to cycling in high school by Fukutomi; he had never ridden one previously, instead racing around on a scooter. He had originally chosen to attend Hakone Gakuen because it did not have a baseball club; an elbow injury prevented him from playing. His personality is described as wolf-like, and he generally seems very unapproachable. However, since joining the bicycle club, he has formed a strong bond with Fukutomi, and affectionately calls him \u201cFuku-chan.\u201d During the race, he pairs up with Onoda and Manami to get out of a pinch, and from then on starts calling Onoda \"Onoda-chan\", seemingly since he gets fond of Onoda's honest personality and pure desire to catch up.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Touichirou Izumida|\u6cc9\u7530 \u5854\u4e00\u90ce|Izumida T\u014dichir\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Atsushi Abe]]}}\n:Live action actor: Soramu Aoki\n:Izumida is a second-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club.

In the 2017 season, he starts calling upon his upper dorsal muscle, that he's called Fabian (after pro Swiss bicycle racer [[Fabian Cancellara]].) He is quite vain and cares a lot about his appearance, which becomes obvious as he is seen throughout the series doing a tough workout routine. When racing, Izumida usually rides without holding his handlebars, and only zips up his jersey when he gets serious. When producing an effort, he chants \"Abs, abs, abs, abs...!\", a call of support to his chiseled abs. He greatly admires the teams ace sprinter, Hayato Shinkai.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yukinari Kuroda|\u9ed2\u7530 \u96ea\u6210|Kuroda Yukinari}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenji Nojima]]}}\n: Live action actor: Ry\u016btar\u014d Akimoto\n:Kuroda is a second-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. In the race to see who competed in the Inter-High, he loses to first-year, and fellow climber, Manami. In season 3, when he became a third year, he became the second climber along with Manami as Arakita, Fukutomi, Toudou, and Shinkai graduated.\n\n===Kyoto Fushimi High School===\nKyoto Fushimi, or Kyofushi, acts as the third squad in this series and is the wild card of the main three teams. The team has a history as a strong team, where 1st year cyclists would go to become stronger. Its training practices are unknown, but other teams say they were a lot nicer in previous years before Midousuji joined the team.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Akira Midousuji|\u5fa1\u5802\u7b4b \u7fd4|Mid\u014dsuji Akira}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dji Yusa]]}}\n: Live action actor: [[Mitsu Murata]]\n:Midousuji is a first-year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club.

His ruthless personality, paired with his ever-smiling face and habit of calling everything and everyone \"gross,\" gives Midousuji an unapproachable and unsettling atmosphere. He's known by other teams for his tactical expertise, and plans out the events of a race in great detail while taking into account for nearly every possibility. He aims for international acclaim as the fastest cyclist, and will stop at nothing in the pursuit of victory. Midousuji is known for having a rivalry with Sohoku's Shunsuke Imaizumi. In the next year, he relinquished his role as Ace, and became Ace Assistant to Mizuta.\n:\n\n;{{Nihongo|Koutarou Ishigaki|\u77f3\u57a3 \u5149\u592a\u90ce|Ishigaki K\u014dtar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hirofumi Nojima]]}}\n:Ishigaki is a third-year high school student and captain of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club.

Mizuta seeks recognition from those he admires and will do whatever he can to obtain it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tomoya Ihara|\u4e95\u539f \u53cb\u77e2|Ihara Tomoya}}\n:{{Voiced by|Yukitoshi Kikuchi}}\n:Ihara is a third-year high school student and member of the Kyoto Fushimi Bicycle Club.

Several new mangas continue to be published.\n\n==Plot==\nSakamichi Onoda is an [[otaku]] who has just entered high school. In middle school, Onoda did not have any friends with whom he could talk about his interests, and hopes to change that by joining his new school's anime club. However, he is crushed when he discovers the anime club has been disbanded due to lack of interest, and in order to reestablish the club, four new members must join.\n\nSince he was a little boy, Onoda has ridden his [[city bicycle]] (referred to as a \"mamachari\", meaning \"Mommy Bike\", in the anime)\u2014a simple and bulky bicycle designed for short rides\u2014for transportation and fun. A fellow freshman, and much more serious cyclist, named Shunsuke Imaizumi notices Onoda riding his mamachari and mocks him inwardly until he sees Onoda riding up a steep hill with little effort. Another student named Naruko visits [[Akihabara]] to get some plastic [[Gundam]] models for his younger brothers and meets Onoda, who catches his attention because of his cycling skill on the mamachari. Later on, both Naruko and Imaizumi try to convince him to join the bicycle racing club at their high school, Sohoku.\n\n==Teams and characters==\n\n===Sohoku High School===\nSohoku is a hard-working team that acts as the main school in the story. The team is characterized as being able to overcome internal conflicts and brutal training. For example, Sohoku hosts an intense and gruelling 1000&nbsp;km training camp every year to determine who will advance to the main race of the series, the Inter-High.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sakamichi Onoda|\u5c0f\u91ce\u7530 \u5742\u9053|Onoda Sakamichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Daiki Yamashita]]}}\n:Live action actor: [[Yuuki Ogoe]] (TV Series), Ren Nagase (Movie)\n:Onoda is the main protagonist of the series, a first-year high school student, and a proud member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. His personality is initially characterized as being a shy [[otaku]] with a difficulty in speaking up for himself. However, after joining the bicycle club, his confidence receives a dramatic boost, and the love and admiration he has for his fellow teammates becomes apparent. Since the very beginning of the series, Onoda shows steady stamina and high cadence abilities when riding uphill, and thus, the captain of the team, Kinjou, makes Onoda one of the team\u2019s climbers. To nurture Onoda\u2019s ability to climb for long periods of time, Kinjou assigns Makishima, a fellow climber and third-year, to tutor him. Onoda\u2019s best cycling ability, the team finds out, is that he performs best when chasing someone in the lead. When Onoda enters the Inter-High, he performs amazing feats for his team such as passing more than 100 cyclists after a crash and drafting Tadokoro, who was recovering from stomach pain, for almost 70km from the back of the race to the front where the rest of the team is.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shunsuke Imaizumi|\u4eca\u6cc9 \u4fca\u8f14|Imaizumi Shunsuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dsuke Toriumi]]}}\n:Live action actor: Tatsunari Kimura (TV Series), [[Kentaro Ito]] (Movie)\n:Imaizumi is a popular first-year high school student and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Imaizumi is a logical thinker with a generally dry personality, although, when entangled in certain situations, he can become quite frenzied and passionate. Because he dreams of one day becoming the fastest cyclist in the world, his cycling style is defined as an all-rounder. Because of Imaizumi\u2019s customarily coarse personality, his relationship with his teammates varies from person to person. For example, he has an intense rivalry with fellow teammate Naruko because of his sprinting abilities and overall attitude, likewise, he sees the captain, Kinjou, as his biggest obstacle. On the other hand, Imaizumi is seen being fairly gentle and kind towards Onoda.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shoukichi Naruko|\u9cf4\u5b50 \u7ae0\u5409|Naruko Sh\u014dkichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Jun Fukushima]]}}\n:Live action actor: Taiga Fukuzawa\n:Naruko is a first-year high school student from Osaka, and a member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. Naruko\u2019s personality is sharp, spunky, and highly competitive, however, he takes cycling very seriously, and often gets very upset if he is defeated in a race, even if it is by another teammate. He is a high-energy sprinter, and his vitality often gets fueled by his mentor, Tadokoro, a fellow sprinter and third-year, who he affectionately refers to as \u201cold man.\u201d He maintains a friendly rivalry with Imaizumi, and is always supportive and caring towards Onoda.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shingo Kinjou|\u91d1\u57ce \u771f\u8b77|Kinj\u014d Shingo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Yasumoto]]}}\n:Live action actor: Naoya Goumoto\n:Kinjou is a sunglasses-wielding third-year high school student and captain of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club.

Kinjou works incredibly hard to bring out the best in everyone\u2019s cycling abilities, especially Imaizumi, who he considers his mentee.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuusuke Makishima|\u5dfb\u5cf6 \u88d5\u4ecb|Makishima Y\u016bsuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Showtaro Morikubo]]}}\n:Live action actor: Ry\u014dma Baba\n:Makishima is a third-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Team. Makishima is the ace climber of the team and has the nickname of \u201cPeak Spider\u201d due to his unusual dancing technique when cycling uphill. His generally awkward personality, in addition to his strange looks, makes Makishima seem unapproachable or even frightening. However, throughout the series, he offers wise advice to his mentee, Onoda, about cycling. Makishima is also well known for having a longtime, intimate rivalry with Hakone\u2019s ace climber, Toudou.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Jin Tadokoro|\u7530\u6240 \u8fc5|Tadokoro Jin}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kentar\u014d It\u014d]]}}\n:Live action actor: Y\u016bki Tomotsune\n:Tadokoro is a third-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Team.

He has an outgoing, cheerful, yet serious personality that never fails to keep the other members in high spirits. Teshima is most noted for having a very close relationship with Aoyagi, a fellow second-year. He is often seen \u201creading Aoyagi\u2019s mind,\u201d and knowing how Aoyagi is feeling or what he wants without him having to speak or show facial expressions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hajime Aoyagi|\u9752\u516b\u6728 \u4e00|Aoyagi Hajime}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]]}}\n:Live action actor: Ry\u014d Yashima\n:Aoyagi is a second-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club.

Aoyagi is a very quiet boy who spends most of his time with Teshima, however, it is not uncommon to see him grow more vocal in stressful situations.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Terufumi Sugimoto|\u6749\u5143 \u7167\u6587|Sugimoto Terufumi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]]}}\n:Live action actor: Hiroki Harai\n:Sugimoto is a first-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club. He avidly claims to be an \u201cexperienced rider,\u201d and often offers advice to the fellow first-years. However, his actual skills are very slim, and he does not even fall into an all-rounder, climber, or sprinter category. His lack of skill becomes even more apparent when he fails to complete the 1000 km training camp because he refused to cycle in the rain. In the case of Onoda, Sugimoto's advice is given not out of ego but a genuine desire to be helpful. With Onoda being very new to the sport, Sugimoto's explanations of the basics greatly benefited him, for which he remains grateful for.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Koga Kimitaka|\u53e4\u8cc0 \u516c\u8cb4|Kimitaka Koga}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuuichi Nakamura]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kaburagi Issa|\u93d1\u6728 \u4e00\u5dee|Issa Kaburagi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiro Shimono]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sugimoto Sadatoki|\u6749\u5143 \u5b9a\u6642|Sadatoki Sugimoto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mitsuhiro Ichiki]]}}\n:Sugimoto Sadatoki is Terufumi Sugimoto Younger Brother and is a first-year high school student and member of the Sohoku High Bicycle Club.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Danchiku Ryuuhou|\u6bb5\u7af9 \u7adc\u5305|Ry\u016bh\u014d Danchiku}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Wataru Hatano]]}}\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gorizou|\u30b4\u30ea\u8535|Goriz\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|Kanuka Mitsuaki}}\n\n===Hakone Academy===\n\nHakone Academy is the country's largest cycling team, and claims to be made up of \u201csix aces\u201d with many more in reserve. During the first year of the series, it was noted to have 50 club members. Since Hakone is such an expansive team, the selection process of who does, and does not, go to the Inter-High is quite complex. To determine who has the honor of participating in the Inter-High, all of the members race against each other, and only the winners of each group (A - F), are allowed to participate. Furthermore, these groups are divided so that the team takes three all-rounders, two climbers, and up to two sprinters to the Inter-High.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sangaku Manami|\u771f\u6ce2 \u5c71\u5cb3|Manami Sangaku}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tsubasa Yonaga]]}}\n:Live action actor: [[Keisuke Ueda]]\n:Manami is a first-year high school student and a member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Manami is very easy-going and easily distracted by nature, cycling, and the feeling of complete freedom. He is the mentee climber to third-year, Toudou, and serves as Hakone\u2019s second climber during the Inter-High. Though for different reasons, Onoda and he have a similar joy for climbing hills and the two hit it off almost immediately as friends and competitors.  His most notable feature is that people hallucinate seeing wings on his back when he reaches his top speeds during a race. He accomplishes this by reading the wind conditions, then shifts upwards and dances when gusts come up from behind. His skill allowed him to win his club heats and join the Inter-High team, the first first-year to do so in the club's history.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Jinpachi Toudou|\u6771\u5802 \u5c3d\u516b|T\u014dd\u014d Jinpachi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]}}\n:Live action actor: Ryou Kitamura\n:Toudou is a popular third-year student and a member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Toudou is the ace climber of Hakone, and mentor to first-year, Manami.

His personality is very pompous, and he thinks very highly of himself. Toudou has many female fans who tend to inflate his ego, however, his strong relationship with Sohoku\u2019s ace climber, Makishima, who he affectionately calls \u201cMaki-chan,\u201d tends to mellow him out again. Toudou is most often noted for his very intimate rivalry with Makishima.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Juichi Fukutomi|\u798f\u5bcc \u5bff\u4e00|Fukutomi Juichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}\n: Live action actor: [[Eiji Takigawa]]\n:Fukutomi is a third-year high school student and captain of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club.

This makes him resolve to win against Sohoku in this years match, hoping it will be atonement for what he did. Throughout the Inter-High, he is often seen sporting his catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m strong.\u201d\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hayato Shinkai|\u65b0\u958b \u96bc\u4eba|Shinkai Hayato}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]]}}\n:Live action actor: Shuuto Miyazaki\n:Shinkai is a third-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club. Shinkai is the team\u2019s ace sprinter, and claims to have a \u201cmonster locked up inside of him\u201d that gets \u201creleased\u201d during especially stressful races. Shinkai\u2019s personality is usually relaxed and easy-going, and he is often seen with a power bar in his mouth and striking his signature \u201cbakyun!\u201d pose. In a past race, Shinkai ran over and killed a mother rabbit, leaving an orphaned kit who he then adopted. Because of his guilt, Shinkai stopped cycling for his team transiently, and became unable to pass other riders during races on the left side since that was what happened when he killed the rabbit. Although he is the ace sprinter, it was decided it would be best for him to not participate in the first sprinters race (first check point) during day one of the Inter high race and have Izumida represent their team during that day. Later he would race against Midousuji during the second one on the second day.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yasutomo Arakita|\u8352\u5317 \u9756\u53cb|Arakita Yasutomo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino]]}}\n:Live action actor: [[Hiroki Suzuki (born 1985)|Hiroki Suzuki]]\n:Arakita is a third-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club.

He had originally chosen to attend Hakone Gakuen because it did not have a baseball club; an elbow injury prevented him from playing. His personality is described as wolf-like, and he generally seems very unapproachable. However, since joining the bicycle club, he has formed a strong bond with Fukutomi, and affectionately calls him \u201cFuku-chan.\u201d During the race, he pairs up with Onoda and Manami to get out of a pinch, and from then on starts calling Onoda \"Onoda-chan\", seemingly since he gets fond of Onoda's honest personality and pure desire to catch up.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Touichirou Izumida|\u6cc9\u7530 \u5854\u4e00\u90ce|Izumida T\u014dichir\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Atsushi Abe]]}}\n:Live action actor: Soramu Aoki\n:Izumida is a second-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club.

In the 2017 season, he starts calling upon his upper dorsal muscle, that he's called Fabian (after pro Swiss bicycle racer [[Fabian Cancellara]].) He is quite vain and cares a lot about his appearance, which becomes obvious as he is seen throughout the series doing a tough workout routine. When racing, Izumida usually rides without holding his handlebars, and only zips up his jersey when he gets serious. When producing an effort, he chants \"Abs, abs, abs, abs...!\", a call of support to his chiseled abs. He greatly admires the teams ace sprinter, Hayato Shinkai.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yukinari Kuroda|\u9ed2\u7530 \u96ea\u6210|Kuroda Yukinari}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenji Nojima]]}}\n: Live action actor: Ry\u016btar\u014d Akimoto\n:Kuroda is a second-year high school student and member of the Hakone Academy Bicycle Club.
