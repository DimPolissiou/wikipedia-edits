She selects five of her first year students to intern at her firm: Wes Gibbins, [[Connor Walsh (character)|Connor Walsh]], Michaela Pratt, Asher Millstone, and [[Laurel Castillo]] (The Keating 5). They work with Annalise's employees, Frank Delfino and [[Bonnie Winterbottom]], an associate lawyer. As the first season introduces occasional clients for Keating, it explores two related murders through both [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] and [[flashforward]] sequences: Lila Stangard, mistress of Annalise's husband and a student at Middleton, and then Sam Keating, Annalise's husband, who was killed by Annalise's interns.\n\nThe first nine episodes alternate between the present-day timeline [[in medias res]], depicting Wes, Connor, Michaela, and Laurel covering up Sam's murder by disposing of his body, and flashbacks detailing the course of events [[foreshadowing|leading up]] to Sam's death, including Annalise's becoming involved in the Lila Stangard investigation, at Wes's urging, leading her to discover Sam's affair and creating suspicion that he killed Lila. The final six episodes explore Annalise's attempt to help her interns cover up Sam's murder and legally implicate Sam in Lila's death, and flashbacks to Lila's final moments before her murder.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)}}\nThe first nine episodes focus on Annalise's defense of Caleb and Catherine Hapstall, who were accused of torturing and murdering their adoptive parents. Wes, in the meantime, teams up with Rebecca's foster brother to try and find Rebecca. Connor struggles with his relationship with Oliver, while Asher works with A.D.A. Emily Sinclair, in order to protect his secrets. In the mid-season finale, Sinclair is murdered, and Annalise helps cover it up, at the expense of her being shot in the stomach by Wes.\n\nThe second part of the season focuses on Wes's investigation of his mother's suicide 10 years ago; flashbacks reveal Annalise's involvement with Wes's mother's suicide. The season ends with Annalise's finding out that Frank was responsible for the car crash that killed her baby, and Annalise sending him away. Michaela and Asher hook up, and Wes meets with his biological father right before the latter is shot dead by an unknown shooter.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)}}\nIn the aftermath of Wallace Mahoney's death, all five of the students attempt to move on. A new mystery arises around the burning down of Annalise's house and who was found dead inside. The events leading up to it involve Annalise's starting a free legal clinic and struggling with alcoholism. Oliver starts working for Annalise, and he leaves Connor when becoming disgusted with himself for rejecting Connor's [[Stanford]] acceptance. Michaela and Asher's relationship starts to progress, as does Wes and Laurel's, and Frank starts working to atone for the death of Annalise's child. Ultimately, it is revealed that it was Wes who died, and that he was killed before the fire. Annalise is arrested for Wes's death. Frank attempts to help Annalise by confessing to killing Wes. It is further revealed that Wes's death was commissioned by Laurel's father, who disapproved of their relationship.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 4)}}\nIn the fourth season, Annalise works with a therapist, Dr. Isaac Roa, to see through her recovery from alcoholism. She initially cuts ties with Bonnie (who moves to the [[District Attorney of Philadelphia|DA's office]] as an [[assistant district attorney]] reporting to DA Todd Denver) and the interns, gets a woman with a long rap sheet freed from jail, and then commits to a major [[class action]] against the state for [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] caused by an underfunded [[public defender]]'s office. Laurel deduces that her father, Jorge Castillo, is responsible for Wes's murder and hatches a scheme to steal incriminating evidence from his law firm with the help of Michaela, Oliver, Frank, and Asher. During the data heist, their classmate Simon (Behzad Dabu) accidentally shoots himself with Laurel's gun, leading to Asher's arrest, and Laurel goes into premature labor after being accidentally struck by Frank. Annalise successfully saves the baby. However, Jorge claims custody of his grandchild by submitting evidence of Laurel's past addictions and history of mental illness to a judge. Laurel's mother arrives unexpectedly to \"help\" Laurel fight against her father, and Frank and Bonnie uncover a mysterious link between Laurel's mother and both Wes and his killer, Dominic. Meanwhile, Annalise searches for alternative ways to win her class action lawsuit. On January 3, 2018, a crossover with ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' was announced which aired on March 1, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/scandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080/ |title='Scandal'/'How To Get Away With Murder' Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From 'HTGAWM' Creator \u2013 Q&A |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=January 3, 2018 |work=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=January 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103215340/http://deadline.com/2018/01/scandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080/ |archive-date=January 3, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Season 5===\n{{main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 5)}}\nOn May 11, 2018, ABC renewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on September 27, 2018.<ref name=\"season5renewal\"/>\n\nAfter Annalise Keating's class-action victory in the Supreme Court, she and her associates seek to start a new chapter in their lives.

Michaela Pratt, Connor Walsh, Asher Millstone and Laurel Castillo start their third year at law school, and a new student, Gabriel Maddox joins the group on Annalise's class.

She selects five of her first year students to intern at her firm: Wes Gibbins, [[Connor Walsh (character)|Connor Walsh]], Michaela Pratt, Asher Millstone, and [[Laurel Castillo]] (The Keating 5). They work with Annalise's employees, Frank Delfino and [[Bonnie Winterbottom]], an associate lawyer. As the first season introduces occasional clients for Keating, it explores two related murders through both [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] and [[flashforward]] sequences: Lila Stangard, mistress of Annalise's husband and a student at Middleton, and then Sam Keating, Annalise's husband, who was killed by Annalise's interns.\n\nThe first nine episodes alternate between the present-day timeline [[in medias res]], depicting Wes, Connor, Michaela, and Laurel covering up Sam's murder by disposing of his body, and flashbacks detailing the course of events [[foreshadowing|leading up]] to Sam's death, including Annalise's becoming involved in the Lila Stangard investigation, at Wes's urging, leading her to discover Sam's affair and creating suspicion that he killed Lila. The final six episodes explore Annalise's attempt to help her interns cover up Sam's murder and legally implicate Sam in Lila's death, and flashbacks to Lila's final moments before her murder.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 2)}}\nThe first nine episodes focus on Annalise's defense of Caleb and Catherine Hapstall, who were accused of torturing and murdering their adoptive parents. Wes, in the meantime, teams up with Rebecca's foster brother to try and find Rebecca. Connor struggles with his relationship with Oliver, while Asher works with A.D.A. Emily Sinclair, in order to protect his secrets. In the mid-season finale, Sinclair is murdered, and Annalise helps cover it up, at the expense of her being shot in the stomach by Wes.\n\nThe second part of the season focuses on Wes's investigation of his mother's suicide 10 years ago; flashbacks reveal Annalise's involvement with Wes's mother's suicide. The season ends with Annalise's finding out that Frank was responsible for the car crash that killed her baby, and Annalise sending him away. Michaela and Asher hook up, and Wes meets with his biological father right before the latter is shot dead by an unknown shooter.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 3)}}\nIn the aftermath of Wallace Mahoney's death, all five of the students attempt to move on. A new mystery arises around the burning down of Annalise's house and who was found dead inside. The events leading up to it involve Annalise's starting a free legal clinic and struggling with alcoholism. Oliver starts working for Annalise, and he leaves Connor when becoming disgusted with himself for rejecting Connor's [[Stanford]] acceptance. Michaela and Asher's relationship starts to progress, as does Wes and Laurel's, and Frank starts working to atone for the death of Annalise's child. Ultimately, it is revealed that it was Wes who died, and that he was killed before the fire. Annalise is arrested for Wes's death. Frank attempts to help Annalise by confessing to killing Wes. It is further revealed that Wes's death was commissioned by Laurel's father, who disapproved of their relationship.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 4)}}\nIn the fourth season, Annalise works with a therapist, Dr. Isaac Roa, to see through her recovery from alcoholism. She initially cuts ties with Bonnie (who moves to the [[District Attorney of Philadelphia|DA's office]] as an [[assistant district attorney]] reporting to DA Todd Denver) and the interns, gets a woman with a long rap sheet freed from jail, and then commits to a major [[class action]] against the state for [[miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]] caused by an underfunded [[public defender]]'s office. Laurel deduces that her father, Jorge Castillo, is responsible for Wes's murder and hatches a scheme to steal incriminating evidence from his law firm with the help of Michaela, Oliver, Frank, and Asher. During the data heist, their classmate Simon (Behzad Dabu) accidentally shoots himself with Laurel's gun, leading to Asher's arrest, and Laurel goes into premature labor after being accidentally struck by Frank. Annalise successfully saves the baby. However, Jorge claims custody of his grandchild by submitting evidence of Laurel's past addictions and history of mental illness to a judge. Laurel's mother arrives unexpectedly to \"help\" Laurel fight against her father, and Frank and Bonnie uncover a mysterious link between Laurel's mother and both Wes and his killer, Dominic. Meanwhile, Annalise searches for alternative ways to win her class action lawsuit. On January 3, 2018, a crossover with ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' was announced which aired on March 1, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/scandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080/ |title='Scandal'/'How To Get Away With Murder' Crossover: Get Details On Big Shondaland Event From 'HTGAWM' Creator \u2013 Q&A |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=January 3, 2018 |work=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=January 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103215340/http://deadline.com/2018/01/scandal-how-to-get-away-with-murder-crossover-shonda-rhimes-kerry-washington-viola-davis-htgawm-creator-qa-1202234080/ |archive-date=January 3, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Season 5===\n{{main|How to Get Away with Murder (season 5)}}\nOn May 11, 2018, ABC renewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on September 27, 2018.<ref name=\"season5renewal\"/>\n\nAfter Annalise Keating's class-action victory in the Supreme Court, she and her associates seek to start a new chapter in their lives. Annalise starts working at Caplan & Gold so she can use their resources for her class-action cases, while also working back at Middleton. Michaela Pratt, Connor Walsh, Asher Millstone and Laurel Castillo start their third year at law school, and a new student, Gabriel Maddox joins the group on Annalise's class. Meanwhile, Frank tries to find out the real reason Maddox came to Middleton in the first place, and Asher joins Bonnie at the DA's office as he gets an intership there.

In 1938, Courtenay-Latimer rediscovered the first live specimen, ''L. chalumnae'', caught off the coast of East London, South Africa. In 1997, a marine biologist on honeymoon discovered the second live species, ''Latimeria menadoensis'', in an Indonesian market.\n\nIn July 1998, the first live specimen of ''Latimeria menadoensis'' was caught in Indonesia. Approximately 80 species of coelacanth have been described, including the two extant species. Before the discovery of a live specimen, the coelacanth time range was thought to have spanned from the Middle Devonian to the Upper Cretaceous period.

menadoensis'' was discovered off Indonesia. Coelacanths have been found in the waters of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Comoros and Indonesia.<ref name=\"ref10\" /> Most ''Latimeria chalumnae'' specimens that have been caught have been captured around the islands of Grande Comore and Anjouan in the Comoros Archipelago (Indian Ocean). Though there are cases of ''L. chalumnae'' caught elsewhere, amino acid sequencing has shown no big difference between these exceptions and those found around Comore and Anjouan. Even though these few may be considered strays, there are several reports of coelacanths being caught off the coast of Madagascar. This leads scientists to believe that the endemic range of ''Latimeria chalumnae'' coelacanths stretches along the eastern coast of Africa from the Comoros Islands, past the western coast of Madagascar to the South African coastline.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> Mitochondrial DNA sequencing of coelacanths caught off the coast of southern Tanzania suggests a divergence of the two populations some 200,000 years ago.

Others migrate to deeper waters.<ref name=\"ref10\" /><ref name=\"ref1\" /> The cooler waters (below 120&nbsp;meters) reduce the coelacanths' metabolic costs. Drifting toward reefs and night feeding saves vital energy.<ref name=\"ref11\" /> Resting in caves during the day also saves energy otherwise used to fight currents.<ref name=\"ref12\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02028843 |title=Coelacanth ''Latimeria chalumnae'' aggregates in caves: First observations on their resting habitat and social behavior |year=1991 |last1=Fricke |first1=Hans |last2=Schauer |first2=J\u00fcrgen |last3=Hissmann |first3=Karen |last4=Kasang |first4=Lutz |last5=Plante |first5=Raphael |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=281\u20136}}</ref>\n[[File:Coelacanth1.JPG|thumb|upright|''Latimeria chalumnae'' model in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], showing the coloration in life.]]\n\n==Behaviour==\nCoelacanth locomotion is unique. To move around they most commonly take advantage of up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins for any kind of movement. Coelacanths create thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroperception, which aids in movement around obstacles.<ref name=\"ref7\" />\n\nCoelacanths are fairly peaceful when encountering others of their kind, remaining calm even in a crowded cave. They do avoid body contact, however, withdrawing immediately if contact occurs. When approached by foreign potential predators (e.g. a submersible), they show panic flight reactions, suggesting that coelacanths are most likely prey to large deepwater predators. Shark bite marks have been seen on coelacanths; sharks are common in areas inhabited by coelacanths.<ref name=\"ref12\" /> [[Electrophoresis]] testing of 14 coelacanth enzymes shows little genetic diversity between coelacanth populations. Among the fish that have been caught were about equal numbers of males and females.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> Population estimates range from 210 individuals per population all the way to 500 per population.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref name=\"ref13\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.97060.x |jstor=2387536 |title=Population Monitoring of the Coelacanth (''Latimeria chalumnae'') |year=2008 |last1=Hissmann |first1=Karen |last2=Fricke |first2=Hans |last3=Schauer |first3=J\u00fcrgen |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=759\u201365}}</ref> Because coelacanths have individual color markings, scientists think that they recognize other coelacanths via electric communication.<ref name=\"ref12\" />\n\n===Feeding===\nCoelacanths are nocturnal piscivores who feed mainly on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] fish populations and various [[cephalopod]]s. They are \"passive drift feeders\", slowly drifting along currents with only minimal self-propulsion, eating whatever prey they encounter.<ref name=\"ref11\" /><ref name=\"ref12\" />\n\n== Life history ==\n[[File:Axelrodichthys araripensis 1.JPG|thumb|Fossil of ''Axelrodichthys araripensis'', an extinct coelacanthiform]]\n[[File:Latimeria chalumnae embryo.jpg|thumb|''Latimeria chalumnae'' embryo with its yolk sac from the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle]]]]\nCoelacanths are [[ovoviviparous]], meaning that the female retains the fertilized eggs within her body while the embryos develop during a gestation period of over a year. Typically, females are larger than the males; their scales and the skin folds around the [[cloaca]] differ. The male coelacanth has no distinct copulatory organs, just a cloaca, which has a [[Genital papilla|urogenital papilla]] surrounded by erectile [[Wattle (anatomy)|caruncles]]. It is hypothesized that the cloaca everts to serve as a copulatory organ.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref name=\"ref2\" />\n\nCoelacanth eggs are large with only a thin layer of membrane to protect them. Embryos hatch within the female and eventually are given live birth, which is a rarity in fish. This was only discovered when the American Museum of Natural History dissected its first coelacanth specimen in 1975 and found it pregnant with five embryos.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Coelacanth: Five Fast Facts|url = http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/from-the-collections-posts/the-coelacanth-five-fast-facts|website = AMNH|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref> Young coelacanths resemble the adult, the main differences being an external yolk sac, larger eyes relative to body size and a more pronounced downward slope of the body. The juvenile coelacanth's broad yolk sac hangs below the pelvic fins. The scales and fins of the juvenile are completely matured; however, it does lack [[odontode]]s, which it gains during maturation.<ref name=\"ref2\" />\n\nA study that assessed the paternity of the embryos inside two Coelacanth females indicated that each clutch was sired by a single male.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Single-male paternity in coelacanths|journal = Nature Communications|volume = 4|page = 2488|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3488|pmid = 24048316|year = 2013|last1 = Lampert|first1 = Kathrin P.|last2 = Blassmann|first2 = Katrin|last3 = Hissmann|first3 = Karen|last4 = Schauer|first4 = J\u00fcrgen|last5 = Shunula|first5 = Peter|last6 = Kharousy|first6 = Zahor el|last7 = Ngatunga|first7 = Benjamin P.|last8 = Fricke|first8 = Hans|last9 = Schartl|first9 = Manfred|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2488L|url = http://oceanrep.geomar.de/22046/1/Lampert%20etal_coelacanth-paternity_NatureComms_2013.pdf}}</ref> This could mean that females mate [[monandrous]]ly, i.e. with one male only. [[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]], female mating with multiple males, is common in both plants and animals and can be advantageous (e.g. insurance against mating with an infertile or incompatible mate), but also confers costs (increased risk of infection, danger of falling prey to predators, increased energy input when searching for new males). Alternatively, the study's results could indicate that, despite female polyandry, one male is used to fertilise all the eggs, potentially through [[Cryptic female choice|female sperm choice]] or last-male [[sperm precedence]].\n\n== Conservation ==\n[[File:Coelacanth sea world.JPG|thumb|Coelacanth]]\n[[File:Coelacanth in Kuwait by Prof Dr Norman Ali Khalaf July 2019.jpg|thumb|Coelacanth at Abdallah Al Salem Cultural Center in Kuwait]] \nBecause little is known about the coelacanth, the conservation status is difficult to characterize. According to Fricke ''et al.'' (1995), there should be some stress put on the importance of conserving this species. From 1988 to 1994, Fricke counted some 60 individuals of ''L. chalumnae'' on each dive. In 1995 that number dropped to 40. Even though this could be a result of natural population fluctuation, it also could be a result of [[overfishing]]. The [[IUCN]] currently classifies ''L. chalumnae'' as [[Critically Endangered]],<ref name=iucn_chal>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/11375/0|title=Latimeria chalumnae|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> with a total population size of 500 or fewer individuals.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> ''L. menadoensis'' is considered [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], with a significantly larger population size (fewer than 10,000 individuals).<ref name=iucn_mel>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/full/135484/0|title=Latimeria menadoensis|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the major threat towards the coelacanth is the accidental capture by fishing operations.<ref>{{cite web|title = Coelacanth|url = http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/river-monsters/fish-guide/coelacanth/|website = Animal Planet|accessdate = 2015-10-29|date = 2012-08-27}}</ref> Coelacanths usually are caught when local fishermen are fishing for [[oilfish]]. Fishermen sometimes snag a coelacanth instead of an oilfish because they traditionally fish at night, when oilfish (and coelacanths) feed.\nBefore scientists became interested in coelacanths, they were thrown back into the water if caught. Now that there is an interest in them, fishermen trade them in to scientists or other officials once they have been caught. Before the 1980s, this was a problem for coelacanth populations. In the 1980s, international aid gave fiberglass boats to the local fishermen, which resulted in fishing beyond the coelacanth territories into more fish-productive waters. Since then, most of the motors on the boats have broken down so the local fishermen are now back in the coelacanth territory, putting the species at risk again.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref name=\"ref14\">{{cite journal |bibcode=1995Natur.374..314F |title=Yet more danger for coelacanths |last1=Fricke |first1=Hans |last2=Hissmann |first2=Karen |last3=Schauer |first3=J\u00fcrgen |last4=Plante |first4=Raphael |volume=374 |year=1995 |pages=314\u20135 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/374314a0 |pmid=<!--none--> |issue=6520}}</ref>\n\nDifferent methods to minimize the number of coelacanths caught include moving fishers away from the shore, using different laxatives and malarial salves to reduce the quantity of oilfish needed, using coelacanth models to simulate live specimens, and increasing awareness of the need to protect the species. In 1987 the Coelacanth Conservation Council advocated the conservation of coelacanths. The CCC has many branches of its agency located in Comoros, South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Japan and Germany.

==\n[[File:Latimeria distribution RUS.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Geographical distribution of coelacanth.]]\nThe current coelacanth range is primarily along the eastern African coast, although ''Latimeria menadoensis'' was discovered off Indonesia. Coelacanths have been found in the waters of Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Madagascar, Comoros and Indonesia.<ref name=\"ref10\" /> Most ''Latimeria chalumnae'' specimens that have been caught have been captured around the islands of Grande Comore and Anjouan in the Comoros Archipelago (Indian Ocean). Though there are cases of ''L. chalumnae'' caught elsewhere, amino acid sequencing has shown no big difference between these exceptions and those found around Comore and Anjouan. Even though these few may be considered strays, there are several reports of coelacanths being caught off the coast of Madagascar. This leads scientists to believe that the endemic range of ''Latimeria chalumnae'' coelacanths stretches along the eastern coast of Africa from the Comoros Islands, past the western coast of Madagascar to the South African coastline.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> Mitochondrial DNA sequencing of coelacanths caught off the coast of southern Tanzania suggests a divergence of the two populations some 200,000 years ago.

The islands' underwater volcanic slopes, steeply eroded and covered in sand, house a system of caves and crevices which allow coelacanths resting places during the daylight hours. These islands support a large [[benthic]] fish population that help to sustain coelacanth populations.<ref name=\"ref11\" /><ref name=\"ref12\" />\n\nDuring the daytime, coelacanths rest in caves anywhere from 100 to 500&nbsp;meters deep.

To move around they most commonly take advantage of up- or down-wellings of current and drift. Their paired fins stabilize movement through the water. While on the ocean floor, they do not use the paired fins for any kind of movement. Coelacanths create thrust with their caudal fins for quick starts. Due to the abundance of its fins, the coelacanth has high maneuverability and can orient its body in almost any direction in the water. They have been seen doing headstands as well as swimming belly up. It is thought that the rostral organ helps give the coelacanth electroperception, which aids in movement around obstacles.<ref name=\"ref7\" />\n\nCoelacanths are fairly peaceful when encountering others of their kind, remaining calm even in a crowded cave. They do avoid body contact, however, withdrawing immediately if contact occurs. When approached by foreign potential predators (e.g. a submersible), they show panic flight reactions, suggesting that coelacanths are most likely prey to large deepwater predators. Shark bite marks have been seen on coelacanths; sharks are common in areas inhabited by coelacanths.<ref name=\"ref12\" /> [[Electrophoresis]] testing of 14 coelacanth enzymes shows little genetic diversity between coelacanth populations. Among the fish that have been caught were about equal numbers of males and females.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> Population estimates range from 210 individuals per population all the way to 500 per population.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref name=\"ref13\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.97060.x |jstor=2387536 |title=Population Monitoring of the Coelacanth (''Latimeria chalumnae'') |year=2008 |last1=Hissmann |first1=Karen |last2=Fricke |first2=Hans |last3=Schauer |first3=J\u00fcrgen |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=759\u201365}}</ref> Because coelacanths have individual color markings, scientists think that they recognize other coelacanths via electric communication.<ref name=\"ref12\" />\n\n===Feeding===\nCoelacanths are nocturnal piscivores who feed mainly on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] fish populations and various [[cephalopod]]s. They are \"passive drift feeders\", slowly drifting along currents with only minimal self-propulsion, eating whatever prey they encounter.<ref name=\"ref11\" /><ref name=\"ref12\" />\n\n== Life history ==\n[[File:Axelrodichthys araripensis 1.JPG|thumb|Fossil of ''Axelrodichthys araripensis'', an extinct coelacanthiform]]\n[[File:Latimeria chalumnae embryo.jpg|thumb|''Latimeria chalumnae'' embryo with its yolk sac from the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle]]]]\nCoelacanths are [[ovoviviparous]], meaning that the female retains the fertilized eggs within her body while the embryos develop during a gestation period of over a year. Typically, females are larger than the males; their scales and the skin folds around the [[cloaca]] differ. The male coelacanth has no distinct copulatory organs, just a cloaca, which has a [[Genital papilla|urogenital papilla]] surrounded by erectile [[Wattle (anatomy)|caruncles]]. It is hypothesized that the cloaca everts to serve as a copulatory organ.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref name=\"ref2\" />\n\nCoelacanth eggs are large with only a thin layer of membrane to protect them. Embryos hatch within the female and eventually are given live birth, which is a rarity in fish. This was only discovered when the American Museum of Natural History dissected its first coelacanth specimen in 1975 and found it pregnant with five embryos.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Coelacanth: Five Fast Facts|url = http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/from-the-collections-posts/the-coelacanth-five-fast-facts|website = AMNH|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref> Young coelacanths resemble the adult, the main differences being an external yolk sac, larger eyes relative to body size and a more pronounced downward slope of the body. The juvenile coelacanth's broad yolk sac hangs below the pelvic fins. The scales and fins of the juvenile are completely matured; however, it does lack [[odontode]]s, which it gains during maturation.<ref name=\"ref2\" />\n\nA study that assessed the paternity of the embryos inside two Coelacanth females indicated that each clutch was sired by a single male.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Single-male paternity in coelacanths|journal = Nature Communications|volume = 4|page = 2488|doi = 10.1038/ncomms3488|pmid = 24048316|year = 2013|last1 = Lampert|first1 = Kathrin P.|last2 = Blassmann|first2 = Katrin|last3 = Hissmann|first3 = Karen|last4 = Schauer|first4 = J\u00fcrgen|last5 = Shunula|first5 = Peter|last6 = Kharousy|first6 = Zahor el|last7 = Ngatunga|first7 = Benjamin P.|last8 = Fricke|first8 = Hans|last9 = Schartl|first9 = Manfred|bibcode = 2013NatCo...4.2488L|url = http://oceanrep.geomar.de/22046/1/Lampert%20etal_coelacanth-paternity_NatureComms_2013.pdf}}</ref> This could mean that females mate [[monandrous]]ly, i.e. with one male only. [[Polyandry in nature|Polyandry]], female mating with multiple males, is common in both plants and animals and can be advantageous (e.g. insurance against mating with an infertile or incompatible mate), but also confers costs (increased risk of infection, danger of falling prey to predators, increased energy input when searching for new males). Alternatively, the study's results could indicate that, despite female polyandry, one male is used to fertilise all the eggs, potentially through [[Cryptic female choice|female sperm choice]] or last-male [[sperm precedence]].\n\n== Conservation ==\n[[File:Coelacanth sea world.JPG|thumb|Coelacanth]]\n[[File:Coelacanth in Kuwait by Prof Dr Norman Ali Khalaf July 2019.jpg|thumb|Coelacanth at Abdallah Al Salem Cultural Center in Kuwait]] \nBecause little is known about the coelacanth, the conservation status is difficult to characterize. According to Fricke ''et al.'' (1995), there should be some stress put on the importance of conserving this species. From 1988 to 1994, Fricke counted some 60 individuals of ''L. chalumnae'' on each dive. In 1995 that number dropped to 40. Even though this could be a result of natural population fluctuation, it also could be a result of [[overfishing]]. The [[IUCN]] currently classifies ''L. chalumnae'' as [[Critically Endangered]],<ref name=iucn_chal>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/11375/0|title=Latimeria chalumnae|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> with a total population size of 500 or fewer individuals.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> ''L. menadoensis'' is considered [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], with a significantly larger population size (fewer than 10,000 individuals).<ref name=iucn_mel>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/full/135484/0|title=Latimeria menadoensis|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the major threat towards the coelacanth is the accidental capture by fishing operations.<ref>{{cite web|title = Coelacanth|url = http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/river-monsters/fish-guide/coelacanth/|website = Animal Planet|accessdate = 2015-10-29|date = 2012-08-27}}</ref> Coelacanths usually are caught when local fishermen are fishing for [[oilfish]]. Fishermen sometimes snag a coelacanth instead of an oilfish because they traditionally fish at night, when oilfish (and coelacanths) feed.\nBefore scientists became interested in coelacanths, they were thrown back into the water if caught. Now that there is an interest in them, fishermen trade them in to scientists or other officials once they have been caught. Before the 1980s, this was a problem for coelacanth populations. In the 1980s, international aid gave fiberglass boats to the local fishermen, which resulted in fishing beyond the coelacanth territories into more fish-productive waters. Since then, most of the motors on the boats have broken down so the local fishermen are now back in the coelacanth territory, putting the species at risk again.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref name=\"ref14\">{{cite journal |bibcode=1995Natur.374..314F |title=Yet more danger for coelacanths |last1=Fricke |first1=Hans |last2=Hissmann |first2=Karen |last3=Schauer |first3=J\u00fcrgen |last4=Plante |first4=Raphael |volume=374 |year=1995 |pages=314\u20135 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/374314a0 |pmid=<!--none--> |issue=6520}}</ref>\n\nDifferent methods to minimize the number of coelacanths caught include moving fishers away from the shore, using different laxatives and malarial salves to reduce the quantity of oilfish needed, using coelacanth models to simulate live specimens, and increasing awareness of the need to protect the species. In 1987 the Coelacanth Conservation Council advocated the conservation of coelacanths. The CCC has many branches of its agency located in Comoros, South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Japan and Germany.

Nate signs a continuation to postpone the civil action until after Xavier's trial. News reports that an anonymous informant caused the FBI to reopen old cases, including Sam's murder, in which Wes is not believed to have acted alone. Michaela, Connor, Asher and Oliver eat hallucinogenic mushrooms. Asher proposes to Michaela as a way to grant them [[spousal immunity]]. Laurel calls them and reveals that Tegan helped her disappear. Asher reveals that he is the informant. Oliver hits him in the nape with a fireplace poker. Asher falls unconscious, but eventually wakes up, revealing that he became the informant because, weeks before, the FBI threatened to arrest his mother, who was aware of thefts in which her husband acted.

Sometime later, Michaela and Connor are arrested for murdering Asher, who was beaten to death outside of Gabriel's apartment. Annalise starts the process of disappearing.

At a bail hearing, Oliver is released due to circumstantial charges, but Connor and Michaela remain in custody. The prosecution offers an immunity deal for the two if they confess their implications for past crimes, including the murder of Sam Keating, and testify against Annalise. If they do not accept it, they would remain in prison until a trial driven by a [[life sentence]]. Nate visits Bonnie and asks if Frank killed Asher, to which she replies that he should turn himself in for killing Ron. Michaela and Connor accept the deal; before signing, both asked that they have the same conditions, even if the other did not sign.

He eventually learns that, after being hit in the head, Asher appeared at Bonnie's house trying to tape her commenting on her involvement in the group's past crimes. Then, Frank drove him home, thus proving that he was killed by someone else sometime later. At a bail hearing, Oliver is released due to circumstantial charges, but Connor and Michaela remain in custody. The prosecution offers an immunity deal for the two if they confess their implications for past crimes, including the murder of Sam Keating, and testify against Annalise. If they do not accept it, they would remain in prison until a trial driven by a [[life sentence]]. Nate visits Bonnie and asks if Frank killed Asher, to which she replies that he should turn himself in for killing Ron. Michaela and Connor accept the deal; before signing, both asked that they have the same conditions, even if the other did not sign.

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1960 and then studied winemaking at Roseworthy College in South Australia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Oenology, in 1982. He is a former winemaker, for this family business, established in 1928 by his grandfather Vittorio De Bortoli. '''Darren''' is well known for his award winning Botrytis Semillon, Noble One. At the age of 33, Darren was appointed Managing Director, which is the position he maintains today. He is also a company director for this family organisation.\n\n'''Darren''' has helped the De Bortoli family achieve its position of Australia\u2019s 6th largest wine company, with an annual turnover of $170 million.  He was also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm}}</ref> which tracked the growth over three generations of the family business from humble Italian immigrants into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHe still lives with his family in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], the village where De Bortoli Wines was established and still home to its head office and to one of its wineries.\n\n===Deen===\n'''Deen De Bortoli''' (born 1936) was the chairman of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1936, and at age 15 he left school to help Vittorio and Giuseppina, his parents run the family business.

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1960 and then studied winemaking at Roseworthy College in South Australia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Oenology, in 1982. He is a former winemaker, for this family business, established in 1928 by his grandfather Vittorio De Bortoli. '''Darren''' is well known for his award winning Botrytis Semillon, Noble One. At the age of 33, Darren was appointed Managing Director, which is the position he maintains today. He is also a company director for this family organisation.\n\n'''Darren''' has helped the De Bortoli family achieve its position of Australia\u2019s 6th largest wine company, with an annual turnover of $170 million.  He was also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm}}</ref> which tracked the growth over three generations of the family business from humble Italian immigrants into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHe still lives with his family in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], the village where De Bortoli Wines was established and still home to its head office and to one of its wineries.\n\n===Deen===\n'''Deen De Bortoli''' (born 1936) was the chairman of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1936, and at age 15 he left school to help Vittorio and Giuseppina, his parents run the family business.

After taking a hiatus from refereeing following [[WrestleMania VII]], he began to reappear on camera around 1992.\n\nHe refereed the match where [[Sean Waltman|The 1-2-3 Kid]] (on that night he was the Kid) as a [[job (professional wrestling)|job]]ber scored a huge upset over [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]].\n\nIn May 1996, Chioda was involved in a controversial ending of a WWF title match at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]], during the match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Davey Boy Smith|the British Bulldog]], referee for the match [[Earl Hebner]] got injured and knocked out of the ring during the match and Chioda came to the ring as a replacement, when Michaels performed a German suplex, Chioda counted Michaels' shoulders down and awarded the match to the Bulldog, but at the same time Chioda counted Michaels down, Hebner came back in the ring and counted Bulldog's shoulders down and awarded the match to Shawn Michaels, then (on screen) President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] came to ring and declared the match a draw.\n\nOn July 3, 1999 on ''[[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|Shotgun]]'', Chioda got an [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Lifting DDT|Implant DDT]] from [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]] following his loss against [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] which Chioda officiated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gangrel vs Test WWF Shotgun July 3, 1999|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gku059M6uqM|accessdate=September 4, 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nChioda has also competed in an actual wrestling match, teaming with [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] to take on the team of [[The Dudley Boyz]] and referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]] on an episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' in 2001. Chioda actually scored the pinfall victory after delivering his version of [[professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|\"The People's Elbow\"]] to Nick Patrick.\n\nDuring the WWF tenure, he officiated matches such as [[Shawn Michaels]] vs. [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]], [[Triple H]] vs. [[Vince McMahon]] at [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon 1999]], The Rock vs. [[Hulk Hogan]] at [[WrestleMania X8]].\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 attacks]], Chioda began to wear an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] patch on his referee shirt.\n\nDuring the [[WWE Brand Extension]], Chioda was sent to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' to become senior referee of that show. On an \"All Referee\" edition of the WWE.com show ''Byte This!'' in 2004, he told an inquiring [[Josh Mathews]] that he did not like the old-style \"button-up and bow-tie\" referee attire, preferring, at the time, the ''SmackDown!'' variant of referee shirt.\n\nDuring his tenure on ''SmackDown'', he officiated a match between [[Big Show]] and [[Brock Lesnar]] in which Lesnar performed a [[suplex#Superplex|superplex]] on Big Show and the ring collapsed. Chioda would rule the match a no contest.\n\nIn 2003, he was traded to ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. Following the firing of Raw's senior referee [[Earl Hebner]] in 2005, Chioda was appointed as ''Raw''`s head referee.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania 23]] he refereed the match between [[John Cena]] and [[Shawn Michaels]], but was taken out after being hit with [[professional wrestling attacks#Superkick|Sweet Chin Music]] by Michaels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/wrestlemania23.html|title=WWE WrestleMania 2007 (23)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time as ''Raw'' brand head referee he would officiate Raw matches such as Triple H vs. [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] at [[WrestleMania 21]],<ref name=\"WrestleMania Main events\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm21/mainevent/ |title=WrestleMania 21 main events |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2008-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226223443/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm21/mainevent/ |archivedate=2007-12-26 }}</ref> [[John Cena]] vs. Triple H at [[WrestleMania 22]],<ref name=\"WrestleMania 22 - Cena vs HHH\">{{cite web|date=2006-04-02|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wrestlemania22/matches/14160262/results|title=WWE Champion John Cena def.

He also appeared in an episode of ''[[WWE Tough Enough]]''{{'}}s second season.<ref name=WWE/>\n\nIn November 2008, referees were made no longer exclusive to certain brands. Chioda refereed his first match on SmackDown in three years on November 28, 2008, when he refereed the Beat The Clock Match between [[Shelton Benjamin]] and Triple H; during the match, Chioda was knocked down and the match ended in controversy when it was decided that [[Jeff Hardy]] and Triple H finished their matches in the same amount of time. To settle this, the [[WWE Championship]] Match at [[Armageddon (2008)|Armageddon 2008]] was made a Triple Threat Match.\n\nAt the pay-per-view event [[Over the Limit (2011)|WWE Over The Limit 2011]], [[The Miz]] initially defeated [[John Cena]] after a cell phone recording of Cena's voice saying \"I Quit\" was played into the microphone, although when the referee Mike Chioda heard it, he immediately reversed the decision and ordered the match to restart. This led to Cena defeating The Miz and retaining the [[WWE Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_50260.shtml|title=PWTorch.com - WWE News: Over the Limit PPV results - Cena vs. The Miz for the WWE Title in an I Quit \"handicap\" match|website=www.pwtorch.com}}</ref> On August 15, 2011, Chioda was suspended for 30 days due to his first violation of the [[WWE]]'s [[WWE#Wellness Program|Talent Wellness Program]].<ref name=\"suspended\">{{ref|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/mike-chioda-suspended|title=Referee Mike Chioda suspended|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 2012, Chioda refereed the match between John Cena and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[WrestleMania XXVIII]]. Chioda was featured as the referee in the 2012 iOS game, [[WWF Wrestlefest|WWE Wrestlefest]].\n\nHe refereed the main event of [[WrestleMania 31]] between Brock Lesnar and [[Roman Reigns]], turning the scheduled singles match into a [[professional wrestling match types#basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] midway through after [[Seth Rollins]] cashed in his [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank contract]] mid-match.
