Jonas began acting in theater at the age of seven, and released his debut single in 2002 which caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] where Jonas formed a band with his older brothers, [[Joe Jonas|Joe]] and [[Kevin Jonas|Kevin]], known as the [[Jonas Brothers]]. The group released their debut studio album ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'' through the Columbia label in 2006. After leaving Columbia Records and signing with [[Hollywood Records]], the group released their [[Jonas Brothers (album)|self-titled second studio album]] in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the [[Disney Channel]] during this time, gaining a large following through the network and they appeared in the widely successful musical television film ''[[Camp Rock]]'' (2008) and its sequel ''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]'' (2010) as well as two of their own series, ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'' (2008\u20132010) and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' (2009\u20132010).\n\nThe band's third studio album, ''[[A Little Bit Longer]]'' (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single \"[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]\" hit the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Lines, Vines and Trying Times]]'' (2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus. Nick formed a new band known as [[Nick Jonas & the Administration]], who released the album ''[[Who I Am (Nick Jonas & the Administration album)|Who I Am]]'' in 2010. Afterward, Jonas shifted his focus to acting and had a recurring role on the television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.\n\nAfter the group's official disbandment in 2013, Jonas began work on his second solo studio album, signing with [[Island Records]] and releasing ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' through the label in 2014, which saw the commercial success of the single \"[[Jealous (Nick Jonas song)|Jealous]]\". Jonas later co-founded [[Safehouse Records]], a record label in conjunction with the Island and Hollywood labels. His third studio album ''[[Last Year Was Complicated]]'' (2016) peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States.

Jonas began acting in theater at the age of seven, and released his debut single in 2002 which caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] where Jonas formed a band with his older brothers, [[Joe Jonas|Joe]] and [[Kevin Jonas|Kevin]], known as the [[Jonas Brothers]]. The group released their debut studio album ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'' through the Columbia label in 2006. After leaving Columbia Records and signing with [[Hollywood Records]], the group released their [[Jonas Brothers (album)|self-titled second studio album]] in 2007, which became their breakthrough record. The band became prominent figures on the [[Disney Channel]] during this time, gaining a large following through the network and they appeared in the widely successful musical television film ''[[Camp Rock]]'' (2008) and its sequel ''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]'' (2010) as well as two of their own series, ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'' (2008\u20132010) and ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'' (2009\u20132010).\n\nThe band's third studio album, ''[[A Little Bit Longer]]'' (2008), saw continued commercial success for the group; the album's lead single \"[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]\" hit the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Lines, Vines and Trying Times]]'' (2009), the Jonas Brothers confirmed a hiatus. Nick formed a new band known as [[Nick Jonas & the Administration]], who released the album ''[[Who I Am (Nick Jonas & the Administration album)|Who I Am]]'' in 2010. Afterward, Jonas shifted his focus to acting and had a recurring role on the television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.\n\nAfter the group's official disbandment in 2013, Jonas began work on his second solo studio album, signing with [[Island Records]] and releasing ''[[Nick Jonas (album)|Nick Jonas]]'' through the label in 2014, which saw the commercial success of the single \"[[Jealous (Nick Jonas song)|Jealous]]\". Jonas later co-founded [[Safehouse Records]], a record label in conjunction with the Island and Hollywood labels. His third studio album ''[[Last Year Was Complicated]]'' (2016) peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. Following the release, Jonas won the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Hal David Starlight Award in 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.songhall.org/special-awards | title = Songwriters Hall of Fame Special Awards | publisher = [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] | accessdate= December 12, 2013}}</ref> In 2017, Jonas appeared in the adventure comedy film ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'', which became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_film#Highest-grossing_films | title = Highest Grossing Films | publisher = [[Wikipedia]] | accessdate= December 12, 2018}}</ref> Jonas is married to Indian actress and singer [[Priyanka Chopra]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1992\u20132006: Childhood and career beginnings===\nJonas was born in [[Dallas, Texas]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1596863/jonas-brothers-to-play-thanksgiving-halftime-show-in-dallas/ |title=Jonas Brothers To Play Thanksgiving Halftime Show In Dallas \u2013 News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> the son of Denise (''n\u00e9e'' Miller) and Paul Kevin Jonas.

The viziers were often appointed by the pharaoh. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]] and early [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]], viziers were exclusively drawn from the royal family; from the period around the reign of [[Neferirkare Kakai]] onwards, they were chosen according to loyalty and talent or inherited the position from their fathers.<ref>M. Heimlich, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', vol.2, pp.21ff.{{date missing}}</ref>\n\n==Responsibilities==\nThe viziers were appointed by the pharaohs and often belonged to a pharaoh's family. The vizier's paramount duty was to supervise the running of the country, much like a [[prime minister]]. At times this included small details such as sampling the city's water supply.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=J|title=Public Health Entomology|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Starkville}}</ref> All other lesser supervisors and officials, such as [[tax collectors]] and [[scribe]]s, reported to the vizier. The judiciary was part of the civil administration, and the vizier also sat in the High Court. At any time, the pharaoh could exert his own control over any aspect of [[government]], overriding the vizier's decisions. The vizier also supervised the security of the [[pharaoh]] and the palace by overseeing the comings and goings of palace visitors<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian administration|others=Moreno Garcia, Juan Carlos|isbn=9789004249523|location=Leiden, The Netherlands|oclc=849248179|year = 2013}}</ref>.

These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, rubber stamps, etc., most of which were decorated with [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] from [[graphic arts]].<ref>Yona Fischer, ''Art and Artisan in the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1979, Israel Museum) (in Hebrew).</ref> In the Jewish settlements artists worked at [[gold smithing]], silver smithing, and embroidery, producing their works in small crafts workshops. A portion of these works were intended to be amulets. One of the best known of these artists, [[Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi]] of Jerusalem made Shiviti (or Shivisi, in the Ashkenazic pronunciation, meditative plaques used in some Jewish communities for contemplation over God's name) on glass and amulets on parchments, with motifs such as the Sacrifice of Isaac, the [[Book of Esther]], and views of the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Western Wall]].<ref>Haviva Peled, \"Seven Artists\", in Fischer (1979).</ref> Objects of applied art were produced also at the \"[[Torah ve-Melakhah]]\" (\"Torah and Work\") school founded in 1882 by the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]].<ref>Gideon Ofrat, \"First Starts: Torah and Work\", in [http://www.openu.ac.il/zmanim/zmanim103/download/zmanim103-ofrat.pdf ''Zmanim''], 103, Summer 2008 (in Hebrew)</ref> This school opened departments for the production of art objects in [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] and [[Baroque]] styles, produced by combining manual labor with modern machines.\n\nA large body of artistic work was produced by European artists, primarily Christian painters, who came to document the sites and landscapes of the \"[[Holy Land]]\". The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation \u2013 first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] \u2013 of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.<ref>Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)</ref> Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.<ref>P.A.

In addition there were other photographers, many of them Armenian, who worked as commercial photographers in the Land of Israel and neighbouring countries.\n\nIn the 1920s, many Jewish painters fleeing pogroms in Europe settled in Tel Aviv.<ref name=\"forward.com\"/>\n\n[[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]], considered the father of Israeli modern art brought to pre-state Israel the influence of the [[School of Paris|\u00c9cole de Paris]]; by teaching and mentoring many of the nascent state's upcoming great artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/About_the_artist.html|title=Yitzhak Alexander Frenkel Frenel|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> Furthermore, he along with other artists led the movement of Israeli artists to the Artist's Quarter of [[Safed|Tzfat]] leading to a golden age of art in the city during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{Citation|title=Yitzhak Frenkel|date=2018-05-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzhak_Frenkel&oldid=842627556|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\n==Art of \"The Land of Israel\", 1906\u20131932==\n\n===Bezalel===\n[[File:Ehad haam school3.jpg|thumb|\"Hebron\", homemade glazed tiles made at the ceramics workshop at Bezalel.]]\n\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century no tradition of fine arts existed in the Land of Israel although European artists came as visitors and painted the \"Holy Land\". Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the \u201cBezalel School of Arts and Crafts,\u201d known as \"[[Bezalel]]\", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.\n\nAt the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British \"[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]\" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine \"''Yalkut Bezalel''\", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption \"Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction\".<ref>Yael Granot, \"Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community\" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)</ref>\n\nAlongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. \"There is a practical side to the study of art\", Schatz wrote, \"The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit\".<ref>Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129</ref>\n\nIn the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the \"Eastern\" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as \"Jewish\" motifs and designs they perceived as \"Eastern\". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.<ref>Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)</ref>\n\nThe work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865\u20131908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as \"[[Jugendstil]]\" [\"Youth Style\" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were \"Orientalist\" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lakhovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.\n\nDue to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.\n\n===Land of Israel modernism movement===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d2 \u05d1\u05ea\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]<br />The Roaring Lion, 1928\u20131934<br />[[Tel Hai]]]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more \"subjective\" art. this Period often called The \"[[Tower of David Period]]\". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''</ref> Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.\n\nThe monument \"The Roaring Lion\" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the \"Assyrian-Mesopotamian\" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. \"For many generations\", Melnikov asserted, \"the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it\".<ref>''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925</ref>\n\nOther young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the \"Hebrew Artists Association\" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an \"Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists\" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the \"Bezalel Art\" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.\n\nAnother organization of Israel artists was called \"Egged\" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh Lubin|Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Chaim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called \"The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930\".\n\nTo a significant extent the modern painters began to create a \"Hebrew\" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward na\u00efve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the \"Land of Israel School\".\n\nAmong the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting \"Resting at Noon\" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this na\u00efve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.\n\nThis approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the \"Railway Crossing at Herzl Street\" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.\n\nReuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in \"Sophie, Bukharin Jewess\" (1924) and \"Dancers from Miron\" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In \"First Fruits\" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in \"First Fruits\" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.\n\nIn spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.\n\n===Armenian ceramic art===\n[[File:Rockefeller Museum fountain2.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Museum]]]]\n\nIn 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.\n\nThe central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884\u20131953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].<ref>Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52</ref> As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts\u2014frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.\n\nThe artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.<ref>Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53\u201391.</ref> Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.\n\n==Between East and West: The 1930s and 1940s==\n[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|[[Zeev Ben Zvi]], Aharon Meskin]]\n[[File:Larski Human hand's 001.jpg|thumb|[[Helmar Lerski]], Human hands, 1933\u20131940]]\n\nThe return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.<ref>For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).</ref> Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the \"Parisian\" influence was expressed in a \"dynamic softness that melts heavy structures\", German art and the \"[[New Objectivity]]\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.<ref>Gideon Efrat, \"Anorexia Artistica\" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.</ref>\n\nThe most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the \"[[Bauhaus]]\". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.\n\nOne sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the \"New Bezalel\". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, \"Bezalel\", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].<ref>Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).</ref> Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, \"The Fleece\" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.\n\nEven more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as [[Zoltan Kluger]], [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.\n\n[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called \"metamorphosis by means of light\"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.\nAnother artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.<ref>Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.<ref>Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.</ref>\n\n===Canaanite movement===\n{{Main|Canaanism}}\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Itzhak Danziger]]<br />Nimrod, 1939<br />The [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem Collection]]\n[[File:Amos kenan.JPG|thumb|[[Amos Kenan]]<br />Messiah, 1966<br />Tefen Open Museum]]\n\nIn 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908\u20131981) published \"Epistle to Hebrew Youth\", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of \"[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]\", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew\u2013speaking nation with an independent identity.\n\nThe visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.\n\nOne of the most significant artists of the \"Canaanite\" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was \"to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us\".<ref>Amos Kenan, \"Greater Israel\", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).</ref> In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.\n\nDanziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.<ref>Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).</ref>  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures \"[[Nimrod]]\" (1939) and \"[[Shabazia]]\" (1939). When \"Nimrod\" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against \"Nimrod\" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of \"Jewishness\". To a significant extent \"Nimrod\" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the \"New Jewish Man\".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that \"Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation\u2026Nimrod will be young forever\".<ref>Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about \"Nimrod\" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the \"Canaanite\" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in \"primitive\" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the \"New Horizons\" group.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \"The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'\", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n== The Artists' Quarter of Tzfat ==\nDuring the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s [[Safed|Tzfat]] served as a beacon of inspiration for Israeli artists. Dozens of different artists including [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]], [[Moshe Castel]], Rosentalis, Shimshon Holzman and others made their home in Tzfat (many of the artists used to spend the summer in the cooler Tzfat and the winter in warmer [[Tel Aviv]], others such as [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]] would commute between France and Tzfat/Tel Aviv).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war of Independence (1948), the Arab quarter was vacated and Tzfat decided to grant homes to Israel's great artists. This led to a golden age of art in Tzfat that would decay from the 1970s onwards.<ref>{{Citation|title=Safed|date=2019-08-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safed&oldid=909927476|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFrenkel Frenel, [[Rolly Sheffer]] and other artists were heavily inspired by the stunning panoramas and views that Tzfat offered them of [[Mount Meron|Mt Meron]], something that is very visible in their work. Tzfat, one of the four holy cities of Judaism provided a powerful emotional scenery to those artists who visited. Frenkel Frenel and others who were influenced by the [[School of Paris|Ecole de Paris]] showcased the mystics of Tzfat with the avant garde movements they partained to. Frenkel Frenel who established the first school of art in Tel Aviv dreamed of the city and was amongst the first artists to settle in the ancient city. Marc Chagall would walk the streets and paint portraits of religious children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>                                                                                                              \n\nDespite the constant decay there remains in Tzfat some galleries that guard the old heritage of art in Safed such as the [[Beit Castel]] gallery, [[Frenkel Frenel Museum]] and others...<ref>{{Citation|title=Beit Castel|date=2019-08-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beit_Castel&oldid=910461355|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Yitzhak Frenkel|date=2019-08-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzhak_Frenkel&oldid=910131806|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n<br />                                                                                                               \n\n==Avant Garde: the 1950s and 1960s==\nIn the 1950s and 1960s Israeli artists began exploring the idiom of the Avant-garde current in Europe and the United States. Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===New Horizons===\n[[File:Zaritsky, Yossef, Painting, 1950-1~B74 0036.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Zaritsky]]<br />Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961 70x50 cm]]\n[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]<br />Growth, 1959<br />Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]\n\nThe germination of the \"New Horizons\" (\"Ofakim Hadashim\") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name \"the Group of Eight\", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called \"The Group of Seven\" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].<ref>Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).</ref> Members of the group stated that \"The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality\".<ref>''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.</ref>\n\nFor these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the \"New Horizons\". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.\n\nThe group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group \u2013 Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called \"lyrical abstract\", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the \"Land of Israel\" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.\n\nFor example, in his series \"Yehiam\" (1949\u20131952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.<ref>Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.</ref>\n\nZvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.\n\nOthers in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.\n\nIn the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.\n\nIndeed, during the 1950s, the \"New Horizons\" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.<ref>See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Realism and Social art===\nWhile the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as \"regionalism\".<ref>Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).</ref> New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, \"Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul\".<ref>Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).</ref> Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period \u2013 World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.\n\nThe quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nNew Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim \u2013 his series \"Yehiam\", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950\u20131952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced \"Wheat Sheaves\" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted \"Soldiers\", \"Air raid Alarms\" and \"Maabarot\" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the \"Center for Advanced Culture\" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement \"[[Hashomer Hatzair]]\".<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.</ref> This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.\n\nMordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting \"Gate of Light\" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.\n\nEver since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].\n\n===Abstract art after New Horizons===\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[Ofakim Hadashim]] (New Horizons) influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.\n\nNew Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called \"Tazpit\" (\"Outlook\"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&nbsp;cm 1971]]\nOne of the artists on the fringe of the \"New Horizons\" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, \"Red House (How Are Things at Home?)\" (1960),<ref>For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, \"The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'\", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).</ref> \"Sarajevo Manuscript\" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works \"The High Commissioner\" (1966) and \"Agripas Street\" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.<ref>Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, \"The High Commissioner\", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).</ref> These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the \"Caananite\" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the \"New Horizons\" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.\nAbstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.<ref>Exceptions to this are the works \"With beers, beers, and more beers\" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works \"Fraction and Time\", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.</ref> Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues \"life experience as the layers accumulate\".<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy\" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963\u20131984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n==Local Art Between Wars, 1967\u20131982==\n[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]<br />''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]\n\nUntil the 1970s, mainstream Israeli art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the \"ars poetica\" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.\n\n===Art of Protest===\nAmong the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].<ref>Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, \"Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin\", in Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).</ref> His early works, such as \"Panic Over Trousers\" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture \"Take Me Under Your Wings\"(1964\u201365) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.</ref> This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture \"He Walked in the Fields\" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the \"mythological Sabra\"; Tumarkin strips off his \"skin\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \"[[Earth Art]]\", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).</ref> Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.\n\n===\"Want of Matter\"===\n[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]<br />Untitled, 1969<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]<br />Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978<br />[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s a group called \"[[10+]]\" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the \"lyric abstraction\" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschitz]], and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although \"10+\" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school \"The College\" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called \"The Want of Matter\".\n\nThe theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit \"The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art\", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the \"non-aesthetic\" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.\n\nAccording to Breitberg-Semel, \"The Want of Matter\" began with the painting of the \"[[New Horizons]]\" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the \"lyrical abstract\", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called \"The Want of Matter\", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.\n\nVisually, \"[[Want of Matter]]\" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.\n\nIn an article accompanying \"The Want of Matter\" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work \"typifies the Tel Aviv spirit\", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally \"native\" and \"Sabra\" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.<ref>Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: \"The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'\"; See: Doron Rabina, \"The Drawing Itself\". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.</ref> Lavie's paintings, which include \"childish\" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words \"head\" or \"geranium\" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,<ref>This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.</ref> came to epitomize \"The Want of Matter\" style.\n\nIn addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its \"artistic language\" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the \"halo\" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.<ref>See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.</ref> Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and \"content\".<ref>Michal Neeman, \"Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here\", 2, 1999, p. 104.</ref>\n\n[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in \"The College\". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as \"The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly\" (1979) and \"The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times\" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation \" If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden\" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a \"toy forest\".<ref>See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.<ref>Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).</ref> Against the background of the visual dimension of \"The Want of Matter\" Style, texts written in commercial style<ref>Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.</ref> or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in \"The Loyal Fish and the Bird\" (1977) or \"The Message According to the Bird\" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series \"The Blue Retouching\" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.\n\nIn spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as \"Bicycle\" (1977) or \"The Princess in the Palace\" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work \"bursts out \" of its frame and spreads out into space.\n\n===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===\n[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]<br />''Energy'', 1969<br />[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n\nConceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yocheved Weinfeld]], [[Adina Bar-On]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading \u2018taste\u2019 while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)\n\nThe axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva\u2019s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.\n\nUllman\u2019s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration \u2013five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.\n\n[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]\nJoshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.\n\nEfrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.\n\nEfrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art \"epistemic abstraction\". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal\u2014the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric\u2014that is, obedient and \u201cblind\u201d\u2014reproductive mechanism.\n\nThese dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 \"Art and Language\", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum \"Eyes of the Nation\" by Ellen Ginton 2008.\n\n[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]<br />Levitation, 1976]]\nThe perception of \"The Want of Matter\" as the \"center\" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the \"Tel Aviv School\", \"The New Jerusalem School\", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the \"Tel Aviv School\", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the \"Jerusalem\" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.<ref>Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).</ref> A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed \"conceptuality\" to \"picturesqueness\", universal abstraction to specific locality.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nAnother trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like \"activity\" and \"concept\", instead of terms like \"installation\" and \"display\", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.<ref>See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).</ref> At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or \"concrete, \" that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.<ref>See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref> Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.\n\nEllen Ginton, in her article \"The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries \" (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).</ref> Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.<ref>Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===\"Place\", \"Concept\" and \"Action\"===\n[[File:NeusteinJerusalemRiverProject.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Neustein]], [[Gerard Marx]], [[Georgette Batlle]], \"Jerusalem River Project\", 1970]]\n[[File:Beersheba, Monument to Negev Brigade, Bunker 02.jpg|thumb|[[Dani Karavan]]<br /> Monument to the Negev Brigade, 1963\u20131968<br />[[Beersheba]]]]\n[[File:Danziger Akalton 002.jpg|thumb|[[Yitzhak Danziger]]<br />Serpentine, 1975<br />The Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n[[File:Ullman, micha way b85 0629.jpg|thumb|[[Micha Ullman]]<br />Passage, 1982<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:AvitalGevaGreenhouse.jpg|thumb|Avital Geva, \"Greenhouse\", Ein-Shemer Kibbutz, Israel]]\n\nOne of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create \"The Jerusalem River Project\". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26\u201332. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThis work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward \"[[Land Art]]\". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the \"Land of Israel\" and the \"Orient\", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the \"New Horizons\" school can be clearly seen.\n\nIn the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of \"Land Art\" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The \"repair\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. \"Nature should not be returned to its natural state\", Danziger contended. \"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept\".<ref>In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).</ref> After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.\n\nAnother example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, \"bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches [\u2026] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish\"<ref>Amnon Barzel, \"Landscape As a Work of Art\" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \"Metzer-Messer\" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88\u201389. (In Hebrew).</ref> Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks\", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \"impoverished\" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as \"Earth Crucifixion\" (1981) and \"Bedouin Crucifixion\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \"crucifixion pillars\"<ref>See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82\u201383. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).</ref> for these lands.\n\nAnother group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \"Leviathians\", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and \"land art\" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work \"Letters of Light\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words \"America\", \"Africa\", and \"Green card\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.<ref>See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238\u2013240.

[[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).</ref> In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work \"Letter to Beuys\" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.\n\nIn his work \"Via Dolorosa\" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, ''\"The Heart of Things\", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971\u20131986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).</ref> In the exhibition \"Exposure\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \"Brushes\" (1974\u20131975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.\n\n===Political art===\nAfter the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.\n\nOne of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work \"Touching the Border\" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \"Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \"Israel 25 Years Hence\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland\".<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] (\"Gabi and Sharon\") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, \"Who needs a parade?\" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.\n\n[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was \"Head Sculpture\", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \"T\", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision\".<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nA blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \"A Gentle Hand\" (1975\u20131978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: \"All Her Heart She Gave Him\" and the first words of which are \"A gentle hand\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904\u20131914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, \"Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?\" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.<ref>Irit Segoli, \"My Red is Your Precious Blood\", Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 38-39.

Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]<br />Jemm\u00e1in, 1986<br />Kunsthalle, Manheim]]\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman cart 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Cart, 1984]]\n[[File:Larry Abramson, tsoba, 1993-1994.jpg|thumb|[[Larry Abramson]]<br />from tsoba, 1993-4<br />impression on newspaper no.XIV<br />private collection]]\n\nMost of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American \"[[Neo-Geo]]\" style, the \"Pop Art\" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as \"[[Bad Painting]]\", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.\n\nThese international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of \"the high\" and \"the low\" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.<ref>See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.\n\nIn parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.\n\nIf in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with \"protest\". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as \"Green Line With Green Eyes\" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-na\u00efve style, combined with captions like \"Here is Arara\" or \"Umm Al-Fahm\".\n\n[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled \"Tsoba\". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], in which he \"erased\", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.\n\nArtistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.\n\nIn the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.\n\n[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named \"Shelter 209\", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the \"[[Zik Group]]\", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.\n\n===The 1990s and After===\n[[File:Adi Ness, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|[[Adi Ness]]<br />Untitled (The Last Supper), 1999<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 5.jpg|thumb|[[Sigalit Landau]]<br />The Recorder of Days and Fruit, 2002<br />(from \"The Country\")]]\n\nThe 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the \"[[Art Focus]]\" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).\n\nAs part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.\n\nIn the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.\n\nIn works such as \"Temple Mount\" (1995) or \"Country\" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined \"primitive\" images with modernist values. In his work \"The Clinic\" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work \"The Boy From South Tel Aviv\" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition \"Real Time\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEven the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition \"Yotam\" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.\n\nIn the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as \"Keffiyah\" and \"Biladi\", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.\n\nThe tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the \"Sabra\" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series \"Jericho First\" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.\n\nThe photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death. In the untitled photograph (1999) that has come to be known as \"The Last Supper\", soldiers sit around a table in a tableau reminiscent of \"The Last Supper\" of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n== Contemporary Israeli Art ==\n\n=== Between Israeli and Jewish Art ===\nSince the birth of Israeli art, there was a long discussion about the role of Jewish content and where it fits within the discourse of Israeli art. The foundation of [[Jerusalem Biennale|The Jerusalem Biennale]] in 2013 was a reaction and partial solution to this discussion. The Jerusalem Biennale aims at creating a platform for contemporary artists and curators who seek to deal with Jewish content and traditions through their works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jerusalembiennale.org/about-the-jerusalem-biennale|title=Vision and Mission|website=The Jerusalem Biennale|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> Modern Israeli artists such as [[Sigalit Landau]], [[Motti Mizrachi]], and [[Maya Zack]] have contributed their work to the Biennale and the exhibitions have displayed works from artists outside of Israel as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jerusalembiennale.org/jb2015|title=JB2015|website=The Jerusalem Biennale|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The fourth edition of the Biennale will take place between October 10th, and November 28, 2019. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Israeli sculpture]]\n* [[List of public art in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dalia Manor, ''Art in Zion: The Genesis of Modern National Art in Jewish Palestine'', Routledge, London, 2005\n*Joshua Simon, ''Neomaterialism'', Sternberg Press, Berlin, 2013\n{{Asian topic|| art}}\n\n[[Category:Israeli art| ]]\n[[Category:Israeli culture]]\n[[Category:Art by country]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:\u05e7\u05e1\u05d8\u05dc \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 (\u05db\u05ea\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d3).jpg|thumb|''Hallelujah'', [[Moshe Castel]] (The Moshe Castel Museum of Art, Maale Adummim)]]\n[[File:Ori Reisman, Carob Tree Boulevard.jpg|thumb|''Carob tree boulevard'', [[Ori Reisman]] ([[Israel Museum]])]]\n'''Visual arts in Israel''' refers to [[Plastic arts|plastic art]] created in the [[Land of Israel]]/[[Palestine region]], from the later part of the [[19th century]] until today, or art created by [[List of Israeli visual artists|Israeli artists]].

The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation \u2013 first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] \u2013 of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.<ref>Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)</ref> Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.<ref>P.A.

Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the \u201cBezalel School of Arts and Crafts,\u201d known as \"[[Bezalel]]\", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.\n\nAt the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British \"[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]\" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine \"''Yalkut Bezalel''\", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption \"Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction\".<ref>Yael Granot, \"Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community\" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)</ref>\n\nAlongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. \"There is a practical side to the study of art\", Schatz wrote, \"The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit\".<ref>Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129</ref>\n\nIn the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the \"Eastern\" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as \"Jewish\" motifs and designs they perceived as \"Eastern\". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.<ref>Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)</ref>\n\nThe work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865\u20131908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as \"[[Jugendstil]]\" [\"Youth Style\" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were \"Orientalist\" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lakhovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.\n\nDue to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.\n\n===Land of Israel modernism movement===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d2 \u05d1\u05ea\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]<br />The Roaring Lion, 1928\u20131934<br />[[Tel Hai]]]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more \"subjective\" art. this Period often called The \"[[Tower of David Period]]\". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''</ref> Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.\n\nThe monument \"The Roaring Lion\" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the \"Assyrian-Mesopotamian\" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. \"For many generations\", Melnikov asserted, \"the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it\".<ref>''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925</ref>\n\nOther young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the \"Hebrew Artists Association\" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an \"Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists\" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the \"Bezalel Art\" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.\n\nAnother organization of Israel artists was called \"Egged\" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh Lubin|Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Chaim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called \"The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930\".\n\nTo a significant extent the modern painters began to create a \"Hebrew\" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward na\u00efve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the \"Land of Israel School\".\n\nAmong the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting \"Resting at Noon\" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this na\u00efve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.\n\nThis approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the \"Railway Crossing at Herzl Street\" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.\n\nReuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in \"Sophie, Bukharin Jewess\" (1924) and \"Dancers from Miron\" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In \"First Fruits\" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in \"First Fruits\" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.\n\nIn spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.\n\n===Armenian ceramic art===\n[[File:Rockefeller Museum fountain2.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Museum]]]]\n\nIn 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.\n\nThe central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884\u20131953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].<ref>Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52</ref> As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts\u2014frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.\n\nThe artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.<ref>Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53\u201391.</ref> Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.\n\n==Between East and West: The 1930s and 1940s==\n[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|[[Zeev Ben Zvi]], Aharon Meskin]]\n[[File:Larski Human hand's 001.jpg|thumb|[[Helmar Lerski]], Human hands, 1933\u20131940]]\n\nThe return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.<ref>For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).</ref> Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the \"Parisian\" influence was expressed in a \"dynamic softness that melts heavy structures\", German art and the \"[[New Objectivity]]\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.<ref>Gideon Efrat, \"Anorexia Artistica\" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.</ref>\n\nThe most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the \"[[Bauhaus]]\". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.\n\nOne sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the \"New Bezalel\". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, \"Bezalel\", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].<ref>Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).</ref> Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, \"The Fleece\" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.\n\nEven more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as [[Zoltan Kluger]], [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.\n\n[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called \"metamorphosis by means of light\"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.\nAnother artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.<ref>Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.<ref>Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.</ref>\n\n===Canaanite movement===\n{{Main|Canaanism}}\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Itzhak Danziger]]<br />Nimrod, 1939<br />The [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem Collection]]\n[[File:Amos kenan.JPG|thumb|[[Amos Kenan]]<br />Messiah, 1966<br />Tefen Open Museum]]\n\nIn 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908\u20131981) published \"Epistle to Hebrew Youth\", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of \"[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]\", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew\u2013speaking nation with an independent identity.\n\nThe visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.\n\nOne of the most significant artists of the \"Canaanite\" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was \"to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us\".<ref>Amos Kenan, \"Greater Israel\", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).</ref> In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.\n\nDanziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.<ref>Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).</ref>  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures \"[[Nimrod]]\" (1939) and \"[[Shabazia]]\" (1939). When \"Nimrod\" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against \"Nimrod\" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of \"Jewishness\". To a significant extent \"Nimrod\" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the \"New Jewish Man\".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that \"Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation\u2026Nimrod will be young forever\".<ref>Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about \"Nimrod\" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the \"Canaanite\" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in \"primitive\" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the \"New Horizons\" group.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \"The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'\", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n== The Artists' Quarter of Tzfat ==\nDuring the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s [[Safed|Tzfat]] served as a beacon of inspiration for Israeli artists. Dozens of different artists including [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]], [[Moshe Castel]], Rosentalis, Shimshon Holzman and others made their home in Tzfat (many of the artists used to spend the summer in the cooler Tzfat and the winter in warmer [[Tel Aviv]], others such as [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]] would commute between France and Tzfat/Tel Aviv).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war of Independence (1948), the Arab quarter was vacated and Tzfat decided to grant homes to Israel's great artists. This led to a golden age of art in Tzfat that would decay from the 1970s onwards.<ref>{{Citation|title=Safed|date=2019-08-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safed&oldid=909927476|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFrenkel Frenel, [[Rolly Sheffer]] and other artists were heavily inspired by the stunning panoramas and views that Tzfat offered them of [[Mount Meron|Mt Meron]], something that is very visible in their work. Tzfat, one of the four holy cities of Judaism provided a powerful emotional scenery to those artists who visited. Frenkel Frenel and others who were influenced by the [[School of Paris|Ecole de Paris]] showcased the mystics of Tzfat with the avant garde movements they partained to. Frenkel Frenel who established the first school of art in Tel Aviv dreamed of the city and was amongst the first artists to settle in the ancient city. Marc Chagall would walk the streets and paint portraits of religious children<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>.                                                                                                               \n\nDespite the constant decay there remains in Tzfat some galleries that guard the old heritage of art in Safed such as the [[Beit Castel]] gallery, [[Frenkel Frenel Museum]] and others...<ref>{{Citation|title=Beit Castel|date=2019-08-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beit_Castel&oldid=910461355|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Yitzhak Frenkel|date=2019-08-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzhak_Frenkel&oldid=910131806|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n<br />                                                                                                               \n\n==Avant Garde: the 1950s and 1960s==\nIn the 1950s and 1960s Israeli artists began exploring the idiom of the Avant-garde current in Europe and the United States. Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===New Horizons===\n[[File:Zaritsky, Yossef, Painting, 1950-1~B74 0036.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Zaritsky]]<br />Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961 70x50 cm]]\n[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]<br />Growth, 1959<br />Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]\n\nThe germination of the \"New Horizons\" (\"Ofakim Hadashim\") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name \"the Group of Eight\", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called \"The Group of Seven\" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].<ref>Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).</ref> Members of the group stated that \"The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality\".<ref>''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.</ref>\n\nFor these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the \"New Horizons\". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.\n\nThe group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group \u2013 Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called \"lyrical abstract\", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the \"Land of Israel\" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.\n\nFor example, in his series \"Yehiam\" (1949\u20131952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.<ref>Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.</ref>\n\nZvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.\n\nOthers in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.\n\nIn the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.\n\nIndeed, during the 1950s, the \"New Horizons\" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.<ref>See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Realism and Social art===\nWhile the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as \"regionalism\".<ref>Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).</ref> New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, \"Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul\".<ref>Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).</ref> Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period \u2013 World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.\n\nThe quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nNew Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim \u2013 his series \"Yehiam\", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950\u20131952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced \"Wheat Sheaves\" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted \"Soldiers\", \"Air raid Alarms\" and \"Maabarot\" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the \"Center for Advanced Culture\" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement \"[[Hashomer Hatzair]]\".<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.</ref> This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.\n\nMordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting \"Gate of Light\" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.\n\nEver since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].\n\n===Abstract art after New Horizons===\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[Ofakim Hadashim]] (New Horizons) influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.\n\nNew Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called \"Tazpit\" (\"Outlook\"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&nbsp;cm 1971]]\nOne of the artists on the fringe of the \"New Horizons\" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, \"Red House (How Are Things at Home?)\" (1960),<ref>For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, \"The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'\", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).</ref> \"Sarajevo Manuscript\" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works \"The High Commissioner\" (1966) and \"Agripas Street\" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.<ref>Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, \"The High Commissioner\", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).</ref> These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the \"Caananite\" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the \"New Horizons\" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.\nAbstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.<ref>Exceptions to this are the works \"With beers, beers, and more beers\" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works \"Fraction and Time\", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.</ref> Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues \"life experience as the layers accumulate\".<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy\" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963\u20131984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n==Local Art Between Wars, 1967\u20131982==\n[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]<br />''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]\n\nUntil the 1970s, mainstream Israeli art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the \"ars poetica\" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.\n\n===Art of Protest===\nAmong the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].<ref>Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, \"Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin\", in Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).</ref> His early works, such as \"Panic Over Trousers\" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture \"Take Me Under Your Wings\"(1964\u201365) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.</ref> This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture \"He Walked in the Fields\" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the \"mythological Sabra\"; Tumarkin strips off his \"skin\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \"[[Earth Art]]\", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).</ref> Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.\n\n===\"Want of Matter\"===\n[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]<br />Untitled, 1969<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]<br />Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978<br />[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s a group called \"[[10+]]\" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the \"lyric abstraction\" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschitz]], and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although \"10+\" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school \"The College\" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called \"The Want of Matter\".\n\nThe theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit \"The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art\", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the \"non-aesthetic\" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.\n\nAccording to Breitberg-Semel, \"The Want of Matter\" began with the painting of the \"[[New Horizons]]\" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the \"lyrical abstract\", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called \"The Want of Matter\", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.\n\nVisually, \"[[Want of Matter]]\" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.\n\nIn an article accompanying \"The Want of Matter\" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work \"typifies the Tel Aviv spirit\", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally \"native\" and \"Sabra\" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.<ref>Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: \"The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'\"; See: Doron Rabina, \"The Drawing Itself\". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.</ref> Lavie's paintings, which include \"childish\" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words \"head\" or \"geranium\" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,<ref>This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.</ref> came to epitomize \"The Want of Matter\" style.\n\nIn addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its \"artistic language\" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the \"halo\" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.<ref>See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.</ref> Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and \"content\".<ref>Michal Neeman, \"Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here\", 2, 1999, p. 104.</ref>\n\n[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in \"The College\". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as \"The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly\" (1979) and \"The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times\" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation \" If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden\" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a \"toy forest\".<ref>See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.<ref>Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).</ref> Against the background of the visual dimension of \"The Want of Matter\" Style, texts written in commercial style<ref>Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.</ref> or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in \"The Loyal Fish and the Bird\" (1977) or \"The Message According to the Bird\" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series \"The Blue Retouching\" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.\n\nIn spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as \"Bicycle\" (1977) or \"The Princess in the Palace\" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work \"bursts out \" of its frame and spreads out into space.\n\n===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===\n[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]<br />''Energy'', 1969<br />[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n\nConceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yocheved Weinfeld]], [[Adina Bar-On]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading \u2018taste\u2019 while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)\n\nThe axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva\u2019s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.\n\nUllman\u2019s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration \u2013five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.\n\n[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]\nJoshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.\n\nEfrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.\n\nEfrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art \"epistemic abstraction\". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal\u2014the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric\u2014that is, obedient and \u201cblind\u201d\u2014reproductive mechanism.\n\nThese dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 \"Art and Language\", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum \"Eyes of the Nation\" by Ellen Ginton 2008.\n\n[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]<br />Levitation, 1976]]\nThe perception of \"The Want of Matter\" as the \"center\" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the \"Tel Aviv School\", \"The New Jerusalem School\", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the \"Tel Aviv School\", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the \"Jerusalem\" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.<ref>Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).</ref> A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed \"conceptuality\" to \"picturesqueness\", universal abstraction to specific locality.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nAnother trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like \"activity\" and \"concept\", instead of terms like \"installation\" and \"display\", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.<ref>See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).</ref> At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or \"concrete, \" that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.<ref>See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref> Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.\n\nEllen Ginton, in her article \"The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries \" (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).</ref> Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.<ref>Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===\"Place\", \"Concept\" and \"Action\"===\n[[File:NeusteinJerusalemRiverProject.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Neustein]], [[Gerard Marx]], [[Georgette Batlle]], \"Jerusalem River Project\", 1970]]\n[[File:Beersheba, Monument to Negev Brigade, Bunker 02.jpg|thumb|[[Dani Karavan]]<br /> Monument to the Negev Brigade, 1963\u20131968<br />[[Beersheba]]]]\n[[File:Danziger Akalton 002.jpg|thumb|[[Yitzhak Danziger]]<br />Serpentine, 1975<br />The Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n[[File:Ullman, micha way b85 0629.jpg|thumb|[[Micha Ullman]]<br />Passage, 1982<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:AvitalGevaGreenhouse.jpg|thumb|Avital Geva, \"Greenhouse\", Ein-Shemer Kibbutz, Israel]]\n\nOne of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create \"The Jerusalem River Project\". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26\u201332. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThis work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward \"[[Land Art]]\". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the \"Land of Israel\" and the \"Orient\", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the \"New Horizons\" school can be clearly seen.\n\nIn the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of \"Land Art\" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The \"repair\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. \"Nature should not be returned to its natural state\", Danziger contended. \"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept\".<ref>In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).</ref> After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.\n\nAnother example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, \"bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches [\u2026] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish\"<ref>Amnon Barzel, \"Landscape As a Work of Art\" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \"Metzer-Messer\" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88\u201389. (In Hebrew).</ref> Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks\", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \"impoverished\" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as \"Earth Crucifixion\" (1981) and \"Bedouin Crucifixion\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \"crucifixion pillars\"<ref>See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82\u201383. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).</ref> for these lands.\n\nAnother group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \"Leviathians\", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and \"land art\" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work \"Letters of Light\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words \"America\", \"Africa\", and \"Green card\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.<ref>See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238\u2013240.

(In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===Identity and the Body===\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Exposure (Installation view), 1975]]\n\nThe landscape as a space for [[performance]] and expressions of [[gender]], which occupied center stage in American art of this period, never caught on in Israel as it did in the [[United States]]. [[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).</ref> In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work \"Letter to Beuys\" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.\n\nIn his work \"Via Dolorosa\" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, ''\"The Heart of Things\", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971\u20131986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).</ref> In the exhibition \"Exposure\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \"Brushes\" (1974\u20131975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.\n\n===Political art===\nAfter the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.\n\nOne of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work \"Touching the Border\" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \"Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \"Israel 25 Years Hence\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland\".<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] (\"Gabi and Sharon\") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, \"Who needs a parade?\" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.\n\n[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was \"Head Sculpture\", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \"T\", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision\".<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nA blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \"A Gentle Hand\" (1975\u20131978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: \"All Her Heart She Gave Him\" and the first words of which are \"A gentle hand\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904\u20131914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, \"Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?\" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.<ref>Irit Segoli, \"My Red is Your Precious Blood\", Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 38-39. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[File:NeusteinStillLifeOnTheBorder.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, \"Still Life On The Border\", Tel-Hai, Israel, 1983]]\nJoshua Neustein\u2019s Still Life 1983 was a shape of a Phantom Jet made of burning car tires on the Lebanon Border.\n\n===The 1980s in Israeli Art===\n[[File:Nahum Tevet, Jemm\u00e1in, 1986, Coll. Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]<br />Jemm\u00e1in, 1986<br />Kunsthalle, Manheim]]\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman cart 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Cart, 1984]]\n[[File:Larry Abramson, tsoba, 1993-1994.jpg|thumb|[[Larry Abramson]]<br />from tsoba, 1993-4<br />impression on newspaper no.XIV<br />private collection]]\n\nMost of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American \"[[Neo-Geo]]\" style, the \"Pop Art\" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as \"[[Bad Painting]]\", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.\n\nThese international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of \"the high\" and \"the low\" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.<ref>See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.\n\nIn parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.\n\nIf in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with \"protest\". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as \"Green Line With Green Eyes\" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-na\u00efve style, combined with captions like \"Here is Arara\" or \"Umm Al-Fahm\".\n\n[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled \"Tsoba\". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], in which he \"erased\", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.\n\nArtistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.\n\nIn the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.\n\n[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named \"Shelter 209\", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the \"[[Zik Group]]\", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.\n\n===The 1990s and After===\n[[File:Adi Ness, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|[[Adi Ness]]<br />Untitled (The Last Supper), 1999<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 5.jpg|thumb|[[Sigalit Landau]]<br />The Recorder of Days and Fruit, 2002<br />(from \"The Country\")]]\n\nThe 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the \"[[Art Focus]]\" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).\n\nAs part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.\n\nIn the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.\n\nIn works such as \"Temple Mount\" (1995) or \"Country\" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined \"primitive\" images with modernist values. In his work \"The Clinic\" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work \"The Boy From South Tel Aviv\" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition \"Real Time\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEven the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition \"Yotam\" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.\n\nIn the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as \"Keffiyah\" and \"Biladi\", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.\n\nThe tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the \"Sabra\" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series \"Jericho First\" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.\n\nThe photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death. In the untitled photograph (1999) that has come to be known as \"The Last Supper\", soldiers sit around a table in a tableau reminiscent of \"The Last Supper\" of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n== Contemporary Israeli Art ==\n\n=== Between Israeli and Jewish Art ===\nSince the birth of Israeli art, there was a long discussion about the role of Jewish content and where it fits within the discourse of Israeli art. The foundation of [[Jerusalem Biennale|The Jerusalem Biennale]] in 2013 was a reaction and partial solution to this discussion. The Jerusalem Biennale aims at creating a platform for contemporary artists and curators who seek to deal with Jewish content and traditions through their works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jerusalembiennale.org/about-the-jerusalem-biennale|title=Vision and Mission|website=The Jerusalem Biennale|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> Modern Israeli artists such as [[Sigalit Landau]], [[Motti Mizrachi]], and [[Maya Zack]] have contributed their work to the Biennale and the exhibitions have displayed works from artists outside of Israel as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jerusalembiennale.org/jb2015|title=JB2015|website=The Jerusalem Biennale|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The fourth edition of the Biennale will take place between October 10th, and November 28, 2019. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Israeli sculpture]]\n* [[List of public art in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dalia Manor, ''Art in Zion: The Genesis of Modern National Art in Jewish Palestine'', Routledge, London, 2005\n*Joshua Simon, ''Neomaterialism'', Sternberg Press, Berlin, 2013\n{{Asian topic|| art}}\n\n[[Category:Israeli art| ]]\n[[Category:Israeli culture]]\n[[Category:Art by country]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts_in_Israel"}

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n\n===Hoover's Gap==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>  \n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

She also figures in the Middle Irish ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]'' (''The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel''). [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] identified her as a sun goddess.\n\n==Name==\nThe name ''\u00c9ta\u00edn'' ({{IPA-sga|e\u02d0dain\u02b2}}) is alternately spelt as ''Edain'', ''Aideen'', ''Etaoin'', ''\u00c9adaoin'', ''Aed\u00edn'', or ''Adaon''. It is derived from a diminutive form of [[Old Irish]] ''\u00e9t'', \"passion, jealousy\".<ref>Koch, John T. (ed.), Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 1675.</ref> She is sometimes known by the epithet Echraide (\"horse rider\"), suggesting links with horse deities and figures such as the Welsh [[Rhiannon]] and the [[Gauls|Gaulish]] [[Epona]].<ref name=MacKillop>MacKillop, p. 195.</ref> In ''Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne'' [[Midir]] names her [[B\u00e9 Find]] (Fair Woman). However, the poem embedded in the text, \"A B\u00e9 Find in ragha lium\" may be an older, unrelated composition that was appended to the story later.<ref>Mac Cana, p. 140.</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\nIn ''[[Tochmarc \u00c9taine]]'', \u00c9ta\u00edn is the daughter of [[Ailill]], king of the [[Ulaid]]. A slightly different genealogy is told in ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]'' (''The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel''). Here she is the daughter of \u00c9tar (described as king of the cavalcade of the elfmounds), and marries the High King [[Eochaid Feidlech]].<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T301017A/text003.html ''The destruction of Da Derga's Hostel'' Section 3]</ref> They have a daughter, called \u00c9ta\u00edn \u00d3g (\u00c9ta\u00edn the Younger), who marries Cormac, king of Ulster. She bears him a daughter, [[Mess Buachalla]], but no sons. Cormac abandons Mess Buachalla, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman. When she grows up she marries the High King [[Etersc\u00e9l]] and becomes the mother of Conaire Mor. In genealogical tracts she is said to have been the wife of the Ulster prince [[Cormac Cond Longas]]. Elsewhere \u00c9ta\u00edn, called Eadon the poetess, appears to be a daughter of Dian C\u00e9cht.<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T100028/index.html ''The Irish Version of the Historia Britonum Nennius'', \"Of the Conquest of Eri as Recorded by Nennius\" Historia 8]</ref> Similarly, the Etain mentioned in the Second Battle of Moytura is the mother of Carpre the poet who satirizes and shames the [[Fomorians]].<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T300011/text114.html ''The Second Battle of Moytura'' Section 114]</ref>\n\n==''Tochmarc \u00c9taine''==\nWhen [[Midir]] of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] falls in love with and marries \u00c9ta\u00edn, Midir's rejected first wife [[F\u00faamnach]] becomes jealous and casts a series of spells on her. First F\u00faamnach turns \u00c9ta\u00edn into a pool of water, then into a worm, (in some versions a snake) and then into a beaultiful scarlet fly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gantz |first=Jeffrey |date=1981 |title=Early Irish Myths and Sagas |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlyirishmythss00jeff/page/45 45] |isbn=9780140443974 |url=https://archive.org/details/earlyirishmythss00jeff/page/45 }}</ref> Midir does not know that the fly is \u00c9ta\u00edn, but it becomes his constant companion, and he has no interest in women. F\u00faamnach then creates a wind that blows the fly away and does not allow it to alight anywhere but the rocks of the sea for seven years.\n\nEventually it lands on the clothes of [[Aengus|\u00d3engus]], who recognises it as \u00c9ta\u00edn, but he is at war with Midir and cannot return her to him. He makes her a little chamber with windows so she can come and go, and carries the chamber with him wherever he goes. But F\u00faamnach hears of this and creates another wind which blows her away from him for another seven years. Eventually the fly falls into a glass of wine. The wine is swallowed (together with the fly) by the wife of \u00c9tar, an Ulster chieftain, in the time of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]]. She becomes pregnant, and \u00c9tain is reborn, one thousand and twelve years after her first birth.<ref>In ''[[The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel]]'' the eternal rebirth of Etain is suggested: \"Then the king, even Eochaid Feidlech, dies, leaving one daughter named, like her mother, Etain, and wedded to Cormac, king of Ulaid.\"</ref> Many modern readers of \"The Wooing of Etaine\" assume that \"fly\" must mean butterfly or dragonfly, but the Irish word clearly translates as fly (or beetle). Since there are both butterflies and dragonflies in Ireland and specific Irish words for both, it is clear that the creature she becomes is actually a fly. \n\nWhen she grows up, \u00c9ta\u00edn marries the [[High King of Ireland|High King]], [[Eochaid Airem]]. Their meeting is related in the opening episode of ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]''.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1100derga.html on-line text at Medieval Sourcebook].</ref> Eochaid's brother Ailill Angubae falls in love with her, and begins to waste away. Eventually he admits to \u00c9ta\u00edn that he is dying of love for her, and she agrees to sleep with him to save his life. They arrange to meet, but Midir casts a spell which causes Ailill to fall asleep and miss the assignation. However, \u00c9ta\u00edn meets a man there who looks and speaks like Ailill but does not sleep with him because she senses that it is not actually him. This happens three times, and the man who looks like Ailill reveals himself to be Midir, and tells her of her previous life as his wife. She refuses to leave with him unless her husband gives her permission. She then returns to Ailill to find him cured.\n\nMidir then goes to Eochaid in his true form and asks to play ''fidchell'', a board game, with him. He offers a stake of fifty horses, loses, and gives Eochaid the horses as promised. Midir challenges him to more games, for higher stakes, and keeps losing. Eochaid, warned by his foster-father that Midir is a being of great power, sets him a series of tasks, including laying a causeway over M\u00f3in L\u00e1mrige, which he performs reluctantly. He then challenges Eochaid to one final game of ''fidchell'', the stake to be named by the winner. This time, Midir wins, and demands an embrace and a kiss from \u00c9ta\u00edn. Eochaid agrees that he will have it if he returns in a month's time. A month later Midir returns. He puts his arms around \u00c9ta\u00edn, and they turn into swans and fly off.\n\nEochaid and his men begin digging at the mound of Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith where Midir lives. Midir appears to them and tells Eochaid his wife will be restored to him the following day. The next day fifty women who all look like \u00c9tain appear, and an old hag tells Eochaid to choose which one is his wife. He chooses one, but Midir later reveals that \u00c9ta\u00edn had been pregnant when he had taken her, and the girl he has chosen is her daughter. Eochaid is horrified, because he has slept with his own daughter, who became pregnant with a girl. When the girl is born she is exposed, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman and his wife. She later becomes the mother of the High King [[Conaire Mor]].\n\n==Dindsenchas==\n\nTwo episodes from the ''Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne'' are also recounted in the metrical [[Dindsenchas]]. The [[Dindsenchas]] poem on Rath Esa recounts how Eochaid Airenn won back \u00c9ta\u00edn. The poem on R\u00e1th Cr\u00faachan refers to Midir's abduction of \u00c9ta\u00edn.\n\n==''Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga''==\n\nThe Middle Irish text ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]'' (Recension II) includes a rather lengthy and colourful depiction of her in the episode of her encounter with King Echu in Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith:\n\n:{|\n|  ''[...] con-accai in mna\u00ed for ur in tobair & c\u00edr chuirr\u00e9l argit co n-ecor de \u00f3r acthe oc folcud a l-luing argit & ceithri h-e\u00f3in \u00f3ir furri & gleorgemai beccai di charrmogul chorcrai h-i forfleascuib na luingi .

She had a bright silver comb with gold ornamentation on it, and she was washing from a silver vessel with four gold birds on it and bright, tiny gems of crimson carbuncle on its rims. There was a crimson cloak of beautiful, curly fleece round her, fastened with a silver brooch coiled with lovely gold; her long-hooded tunic was of stiff, smooth, green silk embroidered with red gold, and there were wondrous animal brooches of gold and silver at her breast and on her shoulders. When the sun shone upon her, the gold would glisten very red against the green silk. Two tresses of yellow gold she had, and each tress was a weaving of four twists with a globe at the end.

Hyacinth blue her eyes; Parthian red her lips. Straight, smooth, soft and white her shoulders; pure white and tapering her fingers; long her arms. As white as sea foam her side, slender, long, smooth, yielding, soft as wool. Warm and smooth, sleek and white her thighs; round and small, firm and white her knees. Short and white and straight her shins; fine and straight and lovely her heels. If a rule were put against her feet, scarcely a fault would be found save for her plenitude of flesh or skin. The blushing light of the moon in her noble face; an uplifting of pride in her smooth brows; a gleam of courting each in her two royal eyes. Dimples of pleasure each of her cheeks, where spots red as the blood of a calf alternated with spots the whiteness of shining snow. A gently, womanly dignity in her voice; a steady, stately step, the walk of a queen. She was the fairest and most perfect and most beautiful of all the women in the world; men thought she was of the S\u00edde, and they said of her: 'Lovely anyone until \u00c9tain. Beautiful anyone until \u00c9tain.'\"<ref>Gantz (tr.), pp. 62\u20133.</ref>\n|}\n\n===Silver basin===\nThe silver basin (Ir. ''long'') with the four golden birds around it may have symbolic or religious significance. Margaret Dobbs has noted the parallel of the three cups offered by Medb to the Ulster heroes in ''[[Fled Bricrenn]]''. Each of these three cups had a bird of greater material value placed on the inside: the bronze cup was fitted out with a bird of ''findruine'', the ''findruine'' one with a bird of gold and the gold cup with a bird of gems. Moreover, she points out a possible relationship to examples of [[Hallstatt culture|late Hallstatt]] pottery and [[bronzeware]] from Central Europe in which figures of aquatic birds were attached to bowls or vases, whether they were specifically designed for religious ceremonies or conveyed religious ideas in more general contexts. She suggests that the literary image may preserve \"a memory of well-worship and of rites performed there with sacred vessels marked with magic symbols\", possibly against evil magic. Such religious practices and ritual vessels may have reached Ireland between about 600 and 300 BC, when immigration took place in Britain and Ireland. In the light of the sacred significance of swans in early Irish literature, Dobbs also notes the episode's possible relevance to F\u00faamnach's malevolent spells and \u00c9ta\u00edn's and Midir's transformation into the shape of swans.<ref>Dobbs, \"The silver basin.\" pp. 202\u20133.</ref>\n\n==Additional references==\nAideen's grave is a megalithic portal tomb located in [[Howth|Binn \u00c9adair]], Ireland that is likely associated with \u00c9ta\u00edn, daughter of \u00c9tar.<ref>[https://www.thejournal.ie/heritage-ireland-howth-dublin-2335796-Sep2015/ ''The Journal'': \"The king in 'high spirits' who arrived to Ireland stuffed with goose pie and Irish whiskey\"]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[\u00c9ta\u00edn (Irish name)]]\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* {{Cite TBDD II}}; tr.

She also figures in the Middle Irish ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]'' (''The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel''). [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] identified her as a sun goddess.\n\n==Name==\nThe name ''\u00c9ta\u00edn'' ({{IPA-sga|e\u02d0dain\u02b2}}) is alternately spelt as ''Edain'', ''Aideen'', ''Etaoin'', ''\u00c9adaoin'', ''Aed\u00edn'', or ''Adaon''. It is derived from a diminutive form of [[Old Irish]] ''\u00e9t'', \"passion, jealousy\".<ref>Koch, John T. (ed.), Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 1675.</ref> She is sometimes known by the epithet Echraide (\"horse rider\"), suggesting links with horse deities and figures such as the Welsh [[Rhiannon]] and the [[Gauls|Gaulish]] [[Epona]].<ref name=MacKillop>MacKillop, p. 195.</ref> In ''Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne'' [[Midir]] names her [[B\u00e9 Find]] (Fair Woman). However, the poem embedded in the text, \"A B\u00e9 Find in ragha lium\" may be an older, unrelated composition that was appended to the story later.<ref>Mac Cana, p. 140.</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\nIn ''[[Tochmarc \u00c9taine]]'', \u00c9ta\u00edn is the daughter of [[Ailill]], king of the [[Ulaid]]. A slightly different genealogy is told in ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]'' (''The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel''). Here she is the daughter of \u00c9tar (described as king of the cavalcade of the elfmounds), and marries the High King [[Eochaid Feidlech]]<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T301017A/text003.html ''The destruction of Da Derga's Hostel'' Section 3]</ref>. They have a daughter, called \u00c9ta\u00edn \u00d3g (\u00c9ta\u00edn the Younger), who marries Cormac, king of Ulster. She bears him a daughter, [[Mess Buachalla]], but no sons. Cormac abandons Mess Buachalla, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman. When she grows up she marries the High King [[Etersc\u00e9l]] and becomes the mother of Conaire Mor. In genealogical tracts she is said to have been the wife of the Ulster prince [[Cormac Cond Longas]]. Elsewhere \u00c9ta\u00edn, called Eadon the poetess, appears to be a daughter of Dian C\u00e9cht.<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T100028/index.html ''The Irish Version of the Historia Britonum Nennius'', \"Of the Conquest of Eri as Recorded by Nennius\" Historia 8]</ref> Similarly, the Etain mentioned in the Second Battle of Moytura is the mother of Carpre the poet who satirizes and shames the [[Fomorians]].<ref>[https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T300011/text114.html ''The Second Battle of Moytura'' Section 114]</ref>\n\n==''Tochmarc \u00c9taine''==\nWhen [[Midir]] of the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] falls in love with and marries \u00c9ta\u00edn, Midir's rejected first wife [[F\u00faamnach]] becomes jealous and casts a series of spells on her. First F\u00faamnach turns \u00c9ta\u00edn into a pool of water, then into a worm, (in some versions a snake) and then into a beaultiful scarlet fly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gantz |first=Jeffrey |date=1981 |title=Early Irish Myths and Sagas |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlyirishmythss00jeff/page/45 45] |isbn=9780140443974 |url=https://archive.org/details/earlyirishmythss00jeff/page/45 }}</ref> Midir does not know that the fly is \u00c9ta\u00edn, but it becomes his constant companion, and he has no interest in women. F\u00faamnach then creates a wind that blows the fly away and does not allow it to alight anywhere but the rocks of the sea for seven years.\n\nEventually it lands on the clothes of [[Aengus|\u00d3engus]], who recognises it as \u00c9ta\u00edn, but he is at war with Midir and cannot return her to him. He makes her a little chamber with windows so she can come and go, and carries the chamber with him wherever he goes. But F\u00faamnach hears of this and creates another wind which blows her away from him for another seven years. Eventually the fly falls into a glass of wine. The wine is swallowed (together with the fly) by the wife of \u00c9tar, an Ulster chieftain, in the time of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]]. She becomes pregnant, and \u00c9tain is reborn, one thousand and twelve years after her first birth.<ref>In ''[[The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel]]'' the eternal rebirth of Etain is suggested: \"Then the king, even Eochaid Feidlech, dies, leaving one daughter named, like her mother, Etain, and wedded to Cormac, king of Ulaid.\"</ref> Many modern readers of \"The Wooing of Etaine\" assume that \"fly\" must mean butterfly or dragonfly, but the Irish word clearly translates as fly (or beetle). Since there are both butterflies and dragonflies in Ireland and specific Irish words for both, it is clear that the creature she becomes is actually a fly. \n\nWhen she grows up, \u00c9ta\u00edn marries the [[High King of Ireland|High King]], [[Eochaid Airem]]. Their meeting is related in the opening episode of ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]''.<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1100derga.html on-line text at Medieval Sourcebook].</ref> Eochaid's brother Ailill Angubae falls in love with her, and begins to waste away. Eventually he admits to \u00c9ta\u00edn that he is dying of love for her, and she agrees to sleep with him to save his life. They arrange to meet, but Midir casts a spell which causes Ailill to fall asleep and miss the assignation. However, \u00c9ta\u00edn meets a man there who looks and speaks like Ailill but does not sleep with him because she senses that it is not actually him. This happens three times, and the man who looks like Ailill reveals himself to be Midir, and tells her of her previous life as his wife. She refuses to leave with him unless her husband gives her permission. She then returns to Ailill to find him cured.\n\nMidir then goes to Eochaid in his true form and asks to play ''fidchell'', a board game, with him. He offers a stake of fifty horses, loses, and gives Eochaid the horses as promised. Midir challenges him to more games, for higher stakes, and keeps losing. Eochaid, warned by his foster-father that Midir is a being of great power, sets him a series of tasks, including laying a causeway over M\u00f3in L\u00e1mrige, which he performs reluctantly. He then challenges Eochaid to one final game of ''fidchell'', the stake to be named by the winner. This time, Midir wins, and demands an embrace and a kiss from \u00c9ta\u00edn. Eochaid agrees that he will have it if he returns in a month's time. A month later Midir returns. He puts his arms around \u00c9ta\u00edn, and they turn into swans and fly off.\n\nEochaid and his men begin digging at the mound of Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith where Midir lives. Midir appears to them and tells Eochaid his wife will be restored to him the following day. The next day fifty women who all look like \u00c9tain appear, and an old hag tells Eochaid to choose which one is his wife. He chooses one, but Midir later reveals that \u00c9ta\u00edn had been pregnant when he had taken her, and the girl he has chosen is her daughter. Eochaid is horrified, because he has slept with his own daughter, who became pregnant with a girl. When the girl is born she is exposed, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman and his wife. She later becomes the mother of the High King [[Conaire Mor]].\n\n==Dindsenchas==\n\nTwo episodes from the ''Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne'' are also recounted in the metrical [[Dindsenchas]]. The [[Dindsenchas]] poem on Rath Esa recounts how Eochaid Airenn won back \u00c9ta\u00edn. The poem on R\u00e1th Cr\u00faachan refers to Midir's abduction of \u00c9ta\u00edn.\n\n==''Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga''==\n\nThe Middle Irish text ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]'' (Recension II) includes a rather lengthy and colourful depiction of her in the episode of her encounter with King Echu in Br\u00ed L\u00e9ith:\n\n:{|\n|  ''[...] con-accai in mna\u00ed for ur in tobair & c\u00edr chuirr\u00e9l argit co n-ecor de \u00f3r acthe oc folcud a l-luing argit & ceithri h-e\u00f3in \u00f3ir furri & gleorgemai beccai di charrmogul chorcrai h-i forfleascuib na luingi .

She had a bright silver comb with gold ornamentation on it, and she was washing from a silver vessel with four gold birds on it and bright, tiny gems of crimson carbuncle on its rims. There was a crimson cloak of beautiful, curly fleece round her, fastened with a silver brooch coiled with lovely gold; her long-hooded tunic was of stiff, smooth, green silk embroidered with red gold, and there were wondrous animal brooches of gold and silver at her breast and on her shoulders. When the sun shone upon her, the gold would glisten very red against the green silk. Two tresses of yellow gold she had, and each tress was a weaving of four twists with a globe at the end.

As white as the snow of a single night her wrists; as tender and even and red as foxglove her clear, lovely cheeks. As black as a beetle's back her brows; a shower of matched pearls her teeth. Hyacinth blue her eyes; Parthian red her lips. Straight, smooth, soft and white her shoulders; pure white and tapering her fingers; long her arms. As white as sea foam her side, slender, long, smooth, yielding, soft as wool. Warm and smooth, sleek and white her thighs; round and small, firm and white her knees. Short and white and straight her shins; fine and straight and lovely her heels. If a rule were put against her feet, scarcely a fault would be found save for her plenitude of flesh or skin. The blushing light of the moon in her noble face; an uplifting of pride in her smooth brows; a gleam of courting each in her two royal eyes. Dimples of pleasure each of her cheeks, where spots red as the blood of a calf alternated with spots the whiteness of shining snow. A gently, womanly dignity in her voice; a steady, stately step, the walk of a queen. She was the fairest and most perfect and most beautiful of all the women in the world; men thought she was of the S\u00edde, and they said of her: 'Lovely anyone until \u00c9tain. Beautiful anyone until \u00c9tain.'\"<ref>Gantz (tr.), pp. 62\u20133.</ref>\n|}\n\n===Silver basin===\nThe silver basin (Ir. ''long'') with the four golden birds around it may have symbolic or religious significance. Margaret Dobbs has noted the parallel of the three cups offered by Medb to the Ulster heroes in ''[[Fled Bricrenn]]''. Each of these three cups had a bird of greater material value placed on the inside: the bronze cup was fitted out with a bird of ''findruine'', the ''findruine'' one with a bird of gold and the gold cup with a bird of gems. Moreover, she points out a possible relationship to examples of [[Hallstatt culture|late Hallstatt]] pottery and [[bronzeware]] from Central Europe in which figures of aquatic birds were attached to bowls or vases, whether they were specifically designed for religious ceremonies or conveyed religious ideas in more general contexts. She suggests that the literary image may preserve \"a memory of well-worship and of rites performed there with sacred vessels marked with magic symbols\", possibly against evil magic. Such religious practices and ritual vessels may have reached Ireland between about 600 and 300 BC, when immigration took place in Britain and Ireland. In the light of the sacred significance of swans in early Irish literature, Dobbs also notes the episode's possible relevance to F\u00faamnach's malevolent spells and \u00c9ta\u00edn's and Midir's transformation into the shape of swans.<ref>Dobbs, \"The silver basin.\" pp. 202\u20133.</ref>\n\n==Additional references==\nAideen's grave is a megalithic portal tomb located in [[Howth|Binn \u00c9adair]], Ireland that is likely associated with \u00c9ta\u00edn, daughter of \u00c9tar.<ref>[https://www.thejournal.ie/heritage-ireland-howth-dublin-2335796-Sep2015/ ''The Journal'': \"The king in 'high spirits' who arrived to Ireland stuffed with goose pie and Irish whiskey\"]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[\u00c9ta\u00edn (Irish name)]]\n* [[List of solar deities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* {{Cite TBDD II}}; tr.

The project involved the damming of the [[Zuiderzee]], a large, shallow inlet of the [[North Sea]], and the reclamation of land in the newly enclosed water using [[polder]]s. Its main purposes are to improve flood protection and create additional land for agriculture.\n\nThe [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] declared these works, together with the [[Delta Works]] in the South-West of the Netherlands, as among the [[Wonders of the World#Wonders of the modern world|Seven Wonders of the Modern World]].<ref>http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/interesting_stuff/7wonders.html|Seven Wonders of the Modern World</ref>\n[[File:North Holland with parts of Friesland and Flevoland by Sentinel-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sentinel-2 photo of the IJsselmeer and surroundings.]]\n[[Image:Afsluitdijk 1031.jpg|right|thumb|The 32&nbsp;km [[Afsluitdijk]] separates the [[IJsselmeer]] (right) from the [[Wadden Sea]] (left), protecting thousands of km\u00b2 of land.]]\n\n==Background==\nThe \"Netherlands\" (literally the \"[[Lower Countries|lower countries]]\") have low flat topography, with half its land area below or less than one metre [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], and has for centuries been subject to periodic flooding by the sea. The seventeenth century saw early proposals to tame and enclose the [[Zuiderzee]], but the ambitious ideas were impractical given the technology then available.\n\n[[Image:Standbeeld Lely Afsluitdijk.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of Cornelis Lely on the Afsluitdijk]]\n\nFrom 1200 to 1900 AD the Dutch [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] {{convert|940000|acre}} of land from the sea and {{convert|345000|acre}} by draining lakes, a total of {{convert|1285000|acre}}, but lost {{convert|1400000|acre}} of land to the Zuiderzee. Hendrik Stevin in 1667 was the first to publish a study (\"How the Fury of the North Sea may be stopped and Holland may be protected against it\") proposing to drain the Zuiderzee. After the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] and [[Haarlemmermeer]] were drained in the mid-19th century, van Diggelen, Kloppenburg, and Faddegon proposed that the Zuiderzee also be drained. Test drilling by the ''{{lang|nl|Zuiderzeevereeniging}}'' found that about three quarters of the Zuiderzee would be useful land.<ref name=\"ley196110\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=October 1961\n |title=The Home-Made Land\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n01_1961-10#page/n91/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=92-106\n |type=\n}}</ref> Plans were developed during the second half of the nineteenth century to protect areas from the force of the open sea and creating new agricultural land. [[Cornelis Lely]] (after whom [[Lelystad]] is named) was an ardent supporter, an engineer, and later government minister. His 1891 plan was the basis for the development of what were to become the Zuiderzee Works. It consisted of a large dam connecting the northern tip of [[North Holland]] with the western coast of [[Friesland]] and the creation of initially four polders in the northwest, the northeast, southeast (later split in two), and southwest of what would be renamed the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]]-lake). Two major lanes of open water were defined for shipping and drainage. The initial body of water affected by the project was {{convert|3500|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Opposition came from fishermen along the Zuiderzee who would lose their livelihood, and from others in coastal areas along the more northerly [[Wadden Sea]]. They feared higher water levels as a result of the closure. Other critics doubted whether the project was feasible financially.\n\nQueen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]]'s 1913 [[throne speech]] urged reclamation of the Zuiderzee.{{r|ley196110}} When Lely became Minister of Transport and Public Works that year, he used his position to promote the Zuiderzee Works and gained support. The government started developing official plans to enclose the Zuiderzee. On January 13 and 14, 1916 the [[Levee|dikes]] at several places along the Zuiderzee broke under the stress of a winter storm, and the land behind them flooded, as had often happened in previous centuries. This flooding provided the decisive impetus to implement the existing plans to tame the Zuiderzee. In addition, a threatening food shortage during the other stresses of [[World War I]] added to widespread support for the project.\n\n[[Image:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|right|thumb|Construction of the Afsluitdijk]]\nOn June 14, 1918, the [[Zuiderzee Act]] was passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwlanderfgoed.nl/studiecentrum/themas/wieg-van-flevoland/zuiderzeewet|work=Nieuwlanderfgoed|title=TZuiderzeewet|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>{{r|ley196110}}\nThe goals of the Act were threefold:\n\n*Protect the central Netherlands from the effects of the North Sea;\n*Increase the Dutch food supply by development and cultivation of new agricultural land; and\n*Improve water management by creating a freshwater lake from the former uncontrolled salt water inlet.\n\nUnlike earlier proposals the act intended to preserve part of the Zuiderzee and create large islands, as Lely warned that rerouting the rivers directly to the North Sea might cause inland flooding if storms raised the sea's level. He also wanted to preserve the Zee's fisheries, and for the new land to be accessible by water.{{r|ley196110}} The ''Dienst der Zuiderzeewerken'' (Zuiderzee Works Department), the government body responsible for overseeing the construction and initial management, was set up in May 1919. It decided against building the main dam first, proceeding to construct a smaller dam, the ''Amsteldiepdijk'', across the Amsteldiep. This was the first step in rejoining the island of [[Wieringen]] to the North Holland mainland. The dike, with a length of 2.5&nbsp;km, was built between 1920 and 1924. As with dike building, polder construction was tested on a small scale at the [[Pilot Polder Andijk|experimental polder at Andijk]].\n\n== Construction phase ==\n\n===Enclosure===\n[[Image:NL-Zuiderzeeworks.svg|right|thumb|The '''Zuiderzee Works''' in the Netherlands divided the dangerous Zuiderzee, a shallow inlet of the North Sea, into the tame lakes of [[IJsselmeer]] and [[Markermeer]], and created 1650&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land.]]\nA new study, commissioned after doubts arose over the financial feasibility of the project, recommended that work should continue and be accelerated. The Zuiderzee Works Department initiated the next two major projects at the same time, in 1927. The most important of these was the main dam, the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (enclosure dam), running from Den Oever on Wieringen to the village of Zurich in Friesland. It was to be 32&nbsp;km long and 90 meters wide, rising to 7.25 meters above sea-level, with an incline of 25% on each side.\n\nExperience showed that [[till]], rather than just sand or clay, was the best primary material for a structure like the Afsluitdijk. An added benefit was that it was easily available; it could be retrieved in large quantities by dredging it from the bottom of the Zuiderzee. Work started at four points: on both sides of the mainland and on two purpose-made construction-islands ([[Kornwerderzand]] and [[Breezanddijk]]) along the line of the future dam.\n\nFrom these points, the dam was expanded as ships deposited till into the open sea in two parallel lines. Sand was poured between these two lines; as the fill emerged above the surface of the water, it was covered by another layer of till. The nascent dam was strengthened with [[basalt]] rocks and mats of [[willow]] switch at its base. The dam was finished by raising it with sand and finally clay for the upper surface of the dam, which was planted with grass.\n\nConstruction progressed better than expected. At three points along the line of the dam were underwater gullies, where the tidal current was much stronger than elsewhere. These had been considered major obstacles to completing the dam but proved not to be so. On May 28, 1932, two years earlier than forecast, the Zuiderzee was closed when the last tidal trench of the ''[[Vlieter]]'' was filled with a bucket of till. The IJsselmeer was born, though the lake still contained salt water at the time.\n\nThe dam was not finished. It still needed to be brought up to its full height, and a road linking Friesland and North Holland remained to be built. In addition to completing the dam, work needed was the construction of shipping [[Canal lock|locks]] and discharge sluices at the ends of the dam. The complex at [[Den Oever]] includes the ''[[Stevin]]'' lock and three series of five sluices for discharging the IJsselmeer into the Wadden Sea. The other complex at Kornwerderzand is composed of the ''[[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]'' locks and two series of five sluices, making a total of 25 discharge sluices. Periodically discharging the lake is necessary since it is continually fed by rivers and streams (most notably the IJssel River, for which the lake is named) and polders draining excess water into the IJsselmeer.\n\nThe Afsluitdijk was opened September 25, 1933, with a monument marking the spot where the dam was finished. It used 23 million m\u00b3 of sand and 13.5 million m\u00b3 of till. An average of 4,000 to 5,000 workers were employed in the dam's construction, relieving unemployment during the [[Great Depression]]. The Total cost of the dam was about [[euro|\u20ac]]700 million (2004 equivalent).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Project\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Dike\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Length\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Start\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Closure\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Size\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Drained\n|-\n|Connection of the island of [[Wieringen]] to continental Holland\n|align=\"center\"|[[Amsteldiepdijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|2.5&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|June 29, 1920\n|align=\"right\"|July 31, 1924\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|-\n|Closure of the [[Zuyderzee]]\n|align=\"center\"|[[Afsluitdijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|32&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|January 1927\n|align=\"right\"|May 23, 1932\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|-\n|[[Pilot Polder Andijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|1.9&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1926\n|align=\"right\"|Early 1927\n|align=\"right\"|40 ha\n|align=\"right\"|August 27, 1927\n|-\n|[[Wieringermeer]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|18&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1927\n|align=\"right\"|July 27, 1929\n|align=\"right\"|20,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|August 31, 1930\n|-\n|[[Noordoostpolder]]\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|55&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1936\n|align=\"right\"|December 13, 1940\n|align=\"right\"|48,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|September 9, 1942\n|-\n|[[Flevoland|Eastern Flevoland]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|90&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|Early 1950\n|align=\"right\"|September 13, 1956\n|align=\"right\"|54,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|June 29, 1957\n|-\n|[[Flevoland|Southern Flevoland]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|70&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|Early 1959\n|align=\"right\"|October 25, 1967\n|align=\"right\"|43,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|May 29, 1968\n|-\n|[[Markerwaard]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|[[Houtribdijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|28&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1963\n|align=\"right\"|September 4, 1975\n|align=\"right\"|(41,000 ha)\n|align=\"right\"|never done\n|}\n\n===Land reclamation===\nAfter damming off the sea, the next step involved creating new land, known as polders. This was achieved by damming off portions of the IJsselmeer, and then pumping all the water out. The first polder, [[Wieringermeer]], was dammed in 1929 and fully drained in 1930. The third, the [[Noordoostpolder]], was not fully drained until 1942. It was an area much used by the Dutch [[Resistance during World War II|Underground resistance]] during [[World War II]], as the fresh polder offered numerous hiding places.\n\nAfter the war, work was started on draining the Flevolands, a massive project totalling almost 1000&nbsp;km\u00b2. This area is now home to [[Lelystad]] and [[Almere]]; the latter is the fastest growing city in the Netherlands (in part because of its proximity to [[Amsterdam]]). Another large polder was originally planned in the [[Markermeer]]. This project was extensively debated until plans were abandoned in the early 2000s, as environmental issues were viewed differently than in the 1920s. A new province, [[Flevoland]], was created out of the Noordoostpolder and the Flevolands in 1986, thereby completing the Works.\n\nThis new land led to an identity change{{huh|date=November 2018}} for towns including [[Lemmer]], [[Vollenhove]], [[Blokzijl]], the former islands of [[Urk]] and [[Schokland]], [[Wieringen]] and others. [[Kuinre]] suffered{{how|date=November 2018}} particularly because it was cut off from open water.\n\nThe other major project started in 1927 was the construction of the 200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> polder in the northwest, the first and the smallest of the five projected polders. It replaced the [[Wieringermeer]], the body of water south of Wieringen,  and also the name of the new polder. It was the only polder reclaimed from the Zuiderzee itself (the others were reclaimed after the Afsluitdijk was finished), but it wasn't entirely the first. A small test polder of some 0.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was constructed in 1926&ndash;1927 near Andijk in North Holland to research the effects drainage would have on the soil of the Zuiderzee and how best to configure the new polders.\n\nBuilding the encircling dike for the Wieringermeer was harder than it was for the later polders, because the Wieringermeer dikes were built before the completion of the Afsluitdijk. That meant the tidal currents of the Zuiderzee were still present. As a consequence, they were somewhat higher. Construction started on the 18&nbsp;km dike from Den Oever on Wieringen and the new construction-island of Oude Zeug and progressed satisfactorily. The Wieringermeer was closed off from the Zuiderzee in July 1929. The next step was draining all the water from the future polder.\n\nDrainage of a polder is performed by a pumping station or mill (''[[gemaal]]'' in Dutch). Two were built for the Wieringermeer, the ''Leemans'', a [[diesel engine|diesel]] powered station, near Den Oever and the ''Lely'', an electrically powered one, near [[Medemblik]]. Different power systems were used in the stations as a safety  mechanism. If one station lost power, the other one would still be able to keep the polder dry. The pumping mechanism itself was based on a variation of the [[Archimedes' screw]], as designed by [[A. Baldwin Wood]]. The stations, completed in February 1930, managed to drain the polder after six months of continuous pumping. \"Drained\" in this context does not mean the land was wholly dry; extensive pools of shallow water still littered the muddy landscape. To make the soil usable it had to be further drained by a network of drainage canals. Small ditches were dug leading to larger watercourses, which in turn transported their water to the main drainage canals. These canals, dredged when the polder was still filled with water, conducted surplus water to the pumping stations. The resulting dehydration caused the former seabed to sink by over a metre in some places. Once the ground had settled, the smaller ditches were replaced with underground drainage tubes, which would be used for the normal drainage of the polder.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+'''Land Usage of the Polders'''<br>(percentage of total surface area){{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Polder\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Size\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Agriculture\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Housing\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Nature\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Infrastructure\n|-\n|Wieringermeer\n|200&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|87%\n|align=\"center\"| 1%\n|align=\"center\"| 3%\n|align=\"center\"|9%\n|-\n|Noordoostpolder\n|480&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|87%\n|align=\"center\"| 1%\n|align=\"center\"| 5%\n|align=\"center\"|7%\n|-\n|Eastern Flevoland\n|540&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|75%\n|align=\"center\"| 8%\n|align=\"center\"|11%\n|align=\"center\"|6%\n|-\n|Southern Flevoland\n|430&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|50%\n|align=\"center\"|25%\n|align=\"center\"|18%\n|align=\"center\"|7%\n|}\n\nWith the hydrological infrastructure in place, the virgin land was developed to prepare for its later cultivation. The first plant to establish itself, though more so in the later polders than in the Wieringermeer, was [[Phragmites|reed]], sown from the air by plane onto the muddy flats while the polder was still being drained. This sturdy plant helped evaporate the water and bring air into the soil, thereby solidifying its structure and further preventing the emergence of unwanted weeds.\n\nAfter the first infrastructure was put in place, the reed was burnt and replaced by [[rapeseed]], turning the newborn polder into a yellow sea of flowers in spring. These crops were succeeded by various grains. In the Wieringermeer the first was [[rye]], but the later polders plant wheat, then [[barley]], and finally oats. This process took years, but once finished allowed planting other crops. At the same time, other infrastructures such as roads and housing were built.\n\nThe Wieringermeer and later polders were divided into plots of about {{convert|50|acre}}. The best land is used for vegetables; the next best for rye and other grain; and the worst land is forested. Each plot has a paved road in the front and a canal in the back to make it accessible by land and water. A [[terp]] in the center of the polder is built higher than the highest recorded flood level of the North Sea to protect people if the dike fails; the Wieringermeer terp is large enough to hold the population of Amsterdam.{{r|ley196110}}\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] in World War II the invading forces at first did not interfere; their engineers inspected the project as a model for reclaiming the [[Frische Haff]].{{Citation needed|reason=Link a source backing the claim that Germans intended to reclaim land in the Frische Haff. No source could be found on the internet.|date=October 2018}} In 1945 retreating Germans ordered the [[inundation of the Wieringermeer]], but the damage was repaired.{{r|ley196110}}\n\n==Polders==\n{{No footnotes|section|date=January 2020}}\n===Wieringermeer===\nThe Wieringermeer, as the first of the envisioned five polders, served as a major testbed for ideas and techniques for the following projects. It is closest to the original concept of the new land being primarily used as agricultural land and it has retained a strong rural character. Four villages eventually were formed in the polder: [[Slootdorp]] (1931), [[Middenmeer]] (1933), [[Wieringerwerf]] (1936), and [[Kreileroord]] (1957).\n\nLocal governance presented a new problem. The area was divided among the mainland municipalities according to the boundaries used when it was water-covered. This configuration was not always practical on the ground and unnecessarily split responsibilities among several bodies. The first solution was a form of government called an ''openbaar lichaam'' or \"public body\", a complicated arrangement which incorporated both the government body in charge of the actual development and an appointed committee responsible for public governance. As the polder became more populated, the demand for representation increased until finally on July 1, 1941 the municipality of [[Wieringermeer]] was established.\n[[File:Overstroming van de Wieringmeerpolder. Op 17 april 1945 hebben de Duitsers nog d, Bestanddeelnr 900-3181.jpg|thumb|Flooding of the Wieringermeer following damage to the dykes during World War II]]\nIn the [[Netherlands in World War II#The final year|closing days]] of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] detonated explosives severely damaging the Wieringermeer dike. No casualties were incurred but the polder sank, and the high water and a subsequent storm destroyed most of the infrastructure built in the previous decade. Reconstruction followed quickly and by the end of 1945 the polder was declared drained again and rebuilding the roads, bridges, houses and farms was greatly facilitated by the experience of building them the first time.\n\n=== Noordoostpolder ===\nThe original 1891 plan called for the largest, southeastern polder to be built after the Wieringermeer, but it was decided in 1932 to give precedence to the northeastern one, which was smaller and therefore considered easier. This would be the '''Noordoostpolder''' (''Northeast-polder''). Due to initial financial difficulties, construction did not begin until 1936. Two dikes, totaling 55&nbsp;km in length, steadily grew in the IJsselmeer, one from [[Lemmer]] in Friesland to the island of [[Urk]], the other from [[Vollenhove]] in [[Overijssel]] to Urk. Construction of these dikes and the necessary pumping stations was disrupted during World War II during the 1940 German conquest of the Netherlands. The encircling dikes were both closed in December 1940, and the pumping stations started draining in early 1941. The Noordoostpolder was considered to be sufficiently drained in September 1942, and the developmental process was started for the 480&nbsp;km\u00b2 of new land.\n\nThe task of building the Noordoostpolder was eased by the earlier experience, the now placid waters of the IJsselmeer, and the mechanisation of the construction process. Machines, sometimes made specifically for the Zuiderzee Works, were increasingly used for this and the final polders. Land usage was much the same as in the Wieringermeer, again focusing on farming. Less fertile areas were designated to be planted as forest land. Land in the polders was state-owned during the entire developmental process. Several years after this was completed, the various plots were distributed among private parties, with priority given to the early pioneers who had been in the polder since the start. Later, farmers from all over the Netherlands became eligible for the remainder. Candidates were put through a selection process before receiving their own pieces of new land.\n[[File:Noordoostpolder by Sentinel-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Satellite picture of Noordoostpolder]]\nThe [[North Sea flood of 1953]] made the government change its priorities. Instead of granting the new land only to farmers selected for their skill, the government granted land to a large number of farmers from the flooded province of [[Zeeland]].\n\nThe polder contains two former islands: the glacial [[moraine]] hill of Urk, and the elongated strip of peat land known as [[Schokland]], largely abandoned in the 19th century. Urk was then and is still today a fishing community and it served as a natural construction-island for both dikes as well as a base of operations for the later exploitation of the polder. Both ceased to be islands: Urk on October 3, 1939, when the dike reaching from Lemmer was closed and Schokland when the surrounding water was consequently drained. Both islands stand out in the new land, physically and figuratively. The community of Urk in particular has remained an entity somewhat distinct from the \"mainland\". It is a separate municipality from the rest of the polder, which was organized as the municipality of Noordoostpolder in 1962. The town of [[Kuinre]] was cut off from the open water, losing businesses and status.\n\nAt the heart of the Noordoostpolder, where the three main drainage canals intersect, is the town of [[Emmeloord]] (1943). Planned to be the first and the only major town of the polder, it serves as the local governmental and services center. Ten smaller villages, conceived more as agricultural communities, were planned in a wide circle around Emmeloord, at a distance chosen to be easily covered by  [[bicycle]]. The first settlements were [[Ens (Netherlands)|Ens]], [[Marknesse]] and [[Kraggenburg]] (1949), followed by [[Luttelgeest]] (1950), [[Bant]] (1951), then [[Creil (Netherlands)|Creil]] and [[Rutten (Netherlands)|Rutten]] (1953), and finally [[Espel]], [[Tollebeek]], and [[Nagele]] (1956). From Emmeloord three canals carry their water to three pumping stations, the ''Buma'' near Lemmer, the ''Smeenge'' at Vollenhove, and finally the ''Vissering'' in Urk. The first two are electrically powered (though connected to different power-plants), while the latter one has diesel power. Like all pumping stations of the Zuiderzee Works, they are named for individuals who made significant contributions to the project.\n\n=== The Flevolands ===<!-- This section is linked from [[September 13]] -->\n\n====Eastern Flevoland====\n[[File:Flevopolder by Sentinel-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Zuidelijk and Oostelijk Flevoland (Southern and Eastern Flevoland)]]\nThe period following World War II was spent restoring the Wieringermeerpolder and catching up with work on the Noordoostpolder. Soon attention turned towards the next project: Eastern Flevoland (Oostelijk Flevoland), which at 540&nbsp;km\u00b2 was the largest of the new polders. In 1950 work commenced on several construction-islands in the middle of the IJsselmeer, the largest of which would be Lelystad-Haven, which initially housed a community of dike-builders.\n\nThe experience of the Noordoostpolder had shown that [[groundwater]] from the higher old mainland would flow to the lower new land, causing [[subsidence]] and dehydration in the old land. It was decided to use [[geohydrology]] to detach the new polders from the mainland. A string of peripheral lakes have been left between the two, requiring a much longer dike of 90&nbsp;km to encircle the polder.\n\nThe plans for a single south-eastern polder were changed to construct two separate polders with a joint hydrological infrastructure. They were divided by a dike in the middle, the ''Knardijk'', which would keep one polder safe should the other be flooded. The two main drainage canals to traverse the dike could be closed by [[weir]]s in such a flooding event. The eastern polder was planned to be the first, and the encircling dike began to take form in 1951. It progressed until the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] struck the south-western Netherlands. Workers and machinery were transferred there for repair work (additional work here was part of the [[Delta Works]]).\n\nWork on Eastern Flevoland resumed in 1954 and the dike was closed on September 13, 1956. The pumping stations started draining the polder that same day, completing the task in June 1957. Three were built: the ''Wortman'' (diesel powered) at Lelystad-Haven, the ''Lovink'' near [[Harderwijk]] and the ''Colijn'' (both electrically powered) along the northern dike beside the Ketelmeer. All three were built with extra capacity with the future southern polder in mind.\n\nA new element in the design of this polder was the intention to establish a larger city to serve as a regional centre for all the polders and perhaps the capital of a potential new [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]]. This city, located in the centre of the reclaimed lands, was developed as [[Lelystad]] (1966), named after the man who had played a crucial role in the design and realisation of the Zuiderzee Works. Other more conventional settlements had already developed by then; Dronten, the local major town, was founded in 1962, followed in 1963 by two smaller satellite villages, Swifterbant and Biddinghuizen. These last three were incorporated into the new municipality of [[Dronten]] on January 1, 1972. Lelystad was large enough to be organized as a separate municipality on January 1, 1980.\n\nThough agriculture was initially the main purpose of the polder, needs of the post-war period changed the design goals of the new polders. Changing agricultural needs and increased motorised mobility meant many farming villages were unnecessary and the number of towns was eventually reduced to two. Work on the village of Larsen was just about to start when it was cancelled. The amount of agricultural land did not increase; it diminished as a result of the building of Lelystad (a city envisioned to eventually house at least 100,000 inhabitants.) By 2005 it had 70,000 residents. In addition, more area was assigned for development as forests and nature reserves, a trend that would continue in the next polder. \n\n====Southern Flevoland ====\nSouthern Flevoland (Zuidelijk Flevoland) was the fourth polder of the Zuiderzee Works, built adjacent to its larger sibling, Eastern Flevoland. Since its northeastern dike, the aforementioned Knardijk, already existed, only 70&nbsp;km of the dike remained to be built. Starting in early 1959, this was finished in October 1967.\n\nOnly one pumping station ('gemaal'), the diesel powered ''De Blocq van Kuffeler'', needed to be built because of the hydrological union of the two Flevolands; once the polder was finished it would simply join the previous three in maintaining the water-level of both polders. Before it could do that however the newest ''gemaal'' had to first drain the 430&nbsp;km\u00b2 polder of its water all by itself, completing its job in May 1968.\n\nDue to the geographically favourable location of the southern polder to the heavily urbanised centre of the Netherlands and in particular [[Amsterdam]], the planners devised a design that would include a large new urban area, to be called [[Almere]], in order to relieve the housing shortage and increasing overcrowding on the old land. Almere was to be divided into 3 major settlements, initially; the first, Almere-Haven (1976), situated along the [[Gooimeer]] (one of the peripheral lakes), the second and largest, Almere-Stad (''Almere City'') (1980), which was to fulfil the role of city centre, and the third, Almere-Buiten (1984), to the northeast towards Lelystad.\n\nThe area between Lelystad and Almere was designated for heavy industries, but since enough space was still available on the old land for those industries this part of the polder was left alone for the mean time. After only a couple of years this landscape of shallow pools, islets and swamps became a popular resting and foraging area for many species of waterfowl, to the extent that it rapidly turned into a nature reserve of national significance. Although accidental in origin, the ''[[Oostvaardersplassen]]'' as they are known became by the 1970s the definitive destination for this section of the polder.\n\nThe centre of the polder most closely resembles the pre-war polders in that it is almost exclusively agricultural. In contrast, the south-eastern part is dominated by extensive forests. It is also home to the only other settlement of the polder, [[Zeewolde]] (1984), again a more conventional town acting as the local centre. Zeewolde became a municipality at the same time as Almere, on January 1, 1984, which in the case of Zeewolde meant that the municipality existed before the town itself, with only farms in the surrounding land to be governed until the town started to grow.\n\n=== Markerwaard ===\nMarkerwaard is a planned fifth polder that has never been completed. It was intended to build a south-western polder, to be called the [[Markerwaard]], at several times during the project, but other polders took precedence. Parts of it have been built; in 1941 it was decided to begin work on the first section of dike, but the German occupiers stopped construction that same year. This dike originated on [[Marken]], the last of the IJsselmeer islands, and went north for some 2&nbsp;km where it ends abruptly today. After World War II, the eastern polder was chosen as the next project, but Marken was not wholly ignored; on October 17, 1957 a 3.5&nbsp;km long dike was closed, running south of the now former island to the [[North Holland]] mainland.\n[[File:Markerwaard 1981.jpg|thumb|upright|Markerwaard as envisioned in 1981]]\nWhen construction started in 1959 on a new dike it had not yet been decided whether this would be the northern dike of Southern Flevoland or the southern dike of the Markerwaard, but the choice eventually fell to the former and another chance for the Markerwaard had passed. A minor flood near Amsterdam in 1960 had demonstrated the danger a large IJsselmeer still presented. A further planned element of the Markerwaard was subsequently executed: a 28&nbsp;km dike between Lelystad and [[Enkhuizen]], including two complexes of locks and discharge sluices at either end, was to split the IJsselmeer in two, with the largest portion (1250&nbsp;km\u00b2) continuing as the IJsselmeer and the smaller lake (700&nbsp;km\u00b2) being named the [[Markermeer]]. Construction of this dike, known later as the ''[[Houtribdijk]]'' or '''Markerwaarddijk''', progressed slowly, lasting from 1963 to 1975, after which it also served as an important road connection between the north of North Holland and the eastern Netherlands. The Houtribdijk did not, however, result in the construction of the rest of the Markerwaard, as many had hoped.\n\nThe debate on whether to build the Markerwaard continued for years. The need for new agricultural land had mostly disappeared by this time and extra space for housing was unnecessary in this region. The existing ecological and recreational value of the Markermeer was considered by many to be equal or superior to any potential such value the Markerwaard would offer. Doubts began to surface about the cost-effectiveness of the polder. The original post-war designs had called for a 410&nbsp;km\u00b2 polder, yet many different proposals were later put forth in an effort to combine the benefits of both the Markerwaard and Markermeer, all to no avail. Although [[cabinet (government)|cabinets]] had intended to proceed with the Markerwaard, it was decided to indefinitely postpone the project in September 1986. A proposed alternative was to use the lake as a water reservoir for hydropower combined with wind-power from windmills on the dikes, eliminating the unpredictability of the latter&nbsp;\u2013 when there is an overcapacity of wind, use that to fill the lake and when there is not enough, use the high water level for hydro power.\n\nIn 2012, plans emerged to create the [[Marker Wadden]],<ref>[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-10683.html Intentieverklaring Marker Wadden, Rijkswaterstaat], Dutch government bulletin, April 2013</ref> a group of islands designed to establish nature reserves in the north of the Markermeer. Contrary to the Markerwaard, no human occupation is planned, although it will be accessible to tourists and [[ornithology|birdwatchers]]. The creation process started in April 2016 with the first new island being inaugurated on 24 September 2016.<ref>https://nos.nl/artikel/2134152-een-nieuw-stukje-nederland-de-marker-wadden-zijn-open.html</ref>\n\n==Province of [[Flevoland]]==\nThe loss of the Markerwaard did not affect plans to create a new [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] out of the polders. The older [[Wieringermeer]] in the north, long since part of [[North Holland]], would not become a part of it, but the municipalities of the other three and the islands of the Noordoostpolder would together form the 12th province of the Netherlands, called [[Flevoland]]. The need for a new province was not immediately clear; Urk and the Noordoostpolder had been part of [[Overijssel]] up to that point and Dronten fell under [[Gelderland]]. After the new municipalities of Southern Flevoland were established in 1984, belonging to no province as was the case with Lelystad, the provincial issue required renewed attention. With only six municipalities and without the Markerwaard, the area was considered by opponents to be insufficiently populous and developed for an entire province, but the polder municipalities were unanimous in their desire: on January 1, 1986 the province of Flevoland was inaugurated. With a population of 356,400 (2004) it was the least populous province, but the province of [[Zeeland]] had only 378,300 and Flevoland has a higher population density than four other provinces. By 2015, Flevoland had surpassed Zeeland in population (403,380, compared to 380,620) and had a density of 280 persons per square kilometre.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Plan Kloppenburg en Faggedon.jpg|Plan Kloppenburg en Faggedon<br />(1848)\nImage:Plan Van Diggelen.jpg|Plan Van Diggelen<br />(1849)\nImage:Plan Beyerinck.jpg|Plan Beyerinck<br /> (1866)\nImage:Plan Stieltjes.jpg|Plan Stieltjes<br /> (1870-1873)\nImage:Planlely.jpg| Original Plan Lely<br /> (date unknown)\nImage:Zuiderzeewerken - Lely plan.jpg|Plan Lely<br /> (1891)\nImage:Zuiderzeewerken proposal 1907.jpg|Plan Zuiderzeewerken<br /> (1907)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Delta Works]] for another major waterworks project in the Netherlands.\n*[[Lauwersmeer|Lauwerszee Works]]\n* [[Flood control in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Flood]]\n* [[Zuiderzeemuseum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Zuiderzee Works}}\n*[http://www.nieuwlanderfgoed.nl/ Nieuw Land Poldermuseum]&nbsp;\u2013 A Flevoland museum on the Zuiderzee Works and Dutch water management in general.\n*[http://www.zuiderzeemuseum.nl/ The Zuiderzee Museum]&nbsp;\u2013 Dedicated to the history and culture of the former Zuiderzee.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20021001182551/http://www.waterland.net/rdij/index_uk.htm Directorate IJsselmeer Region]&nbsp;\u2013 The administration responsible for maintaining most of the Zuiderzee Works.\n*[http://www.holland-cycling.com/where-to-go/long-distance-cycle-routes/national-long-distance-cycle-network/zuider-sea-route-zuiderzeeroute Zuiderzee Cycle Route], long-distance cycle route around the former Zuiderzee.\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n[[Category:20th century in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:History of science and technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Causeways in Europe]]\n[[Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n[[Category:Dams in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Dikes in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Flood control in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Zuiderzee Works| ]]\n[[Category:Dams completed in 1924]]\n[[Category:Polders of North Holland]]\n[[Category:Polders of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Polders of Flevoland]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Friesland]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=November 2008}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Zuiderzee Works}}\nThe '''Zuiderzee Works''' ({{lang-nl|Zuiderzeewerken}}) is a man-made system of [[dam]]s and dikes, [[land reclamation]] and water drainage work, in total the largest [[hydraulic engineering]] project undertaken by the [[Netherlands]] during the twentieth century. The project involved the damming of the [[Zuiderzee]], a large, shallow inlet of the [[North Sea]], and the reclamation of land in the newly enclosed water using [[polder]]s. Its main purposes are to improve flood protection and create additional land for agriculture.\n\nThe [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] declared these works, together with the [[Delta Works]] in the South-West of the Netherlands, as among the [[Wonders of the World#Wonders of the modern world|Seven Wonders of the Modern World]].<ref>http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/interesting_stuff/7wonders.html|Seven Wonders of the Modern World</ref>\n[[File:North Holland with parts of Friesland and Flevoland by Sentinel-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sentinel-2 photo of the IJsselmeer and surroundings.]]\n[[Image:Afsluitdijk 1031.jpg|right|thumb|The 32&nbsp;km [[Afsluitdijk]] separates the [[IJsselmeer]] (right) from the [[Wadden Sea]] (left), protecting thousands of km\u00b2 of land.]]\n\n==Background==\nThe \"Netherlands\" (literally the \"[[Lower Countries|lower countries]]\") have low flat topography, with half its land area below or less than one metre [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], and has for centuries been subject to periodic flooding by the sea.

[[Cornelis Lely]] (after whom [[Lelystad]] is named) was an ardent supporter, an engineer, and later government minister. His 1891 plan was the basis for the development of what were to become the Zuiderzee Works. It consisted of a large dam connecting the northern tip of [[North Holland]] with the western coast of [[Friesland]] and the creation of initially four polders in the northwest, the northeast, southeast (later split in two), and southwest of what would be renamed the [[IJsselmeer]] ([[IJssel]]-lake). Two major lanes of open water were defined for shipping and drainage. The initial body of water affected by the project was {{convert|3500|km2|sqmi|-1}}. Opposition came from fishermen along the Zuiderzee who would lose their livelihood, and from others in coastal areas along the more northerly [[Wadden Sea]]. They feared higher water levels as a result of the closure. Other critics doubted whether the project was feasible financially.\n\nQueen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]]'s 1913 [[throne speech]] urged reclamation of the Zuiderzee.{{r|ley196110}} When Lely became Minister of Transport and Public Works that year, he used his position to promote the Zuiderzee Works and gained support. The government started developing official plans to enclose the Zuiderzee. On January 13 and 14, 1916 the [[Levee|dikes]] at several places along the Zuiderzee broke under the stress of a winter storm, and the land behind them flooded, as had often happened in previous centuries. This flooding provided the decisive impetus to implement the existing plans to tame the Zuiderzee. In addition, a threatening food shortage during the other stresses of [[World War I]] added to widespread support for the project.\n\n[[Image:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|right|thumb|Construction of the Afsluitdijk]]\nOn June 14, 1918, the [[Zuiderzee Act]] was passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwlanderfgoed.nl/studiecentrum/themas/wieg-van-flevoland/zuiderzeewet|work=Nieuwlanderfgoed|title=TZuiderzeewet|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>{{r|ley196110}}\nThe goals of the Act were threefold:\n\n*Protect the central Netherlands from the effects of the North Sea;\n*Increase the Dutch food supply by development and cultivation of new agricultural land; and\n*Improve water management by creating a freshwater lake from the former uncontrolled salt water inlet.\n\nUnlike earlier proposals the act intended to preserve part of the Zuiderzee and create large islands, as Lely warned that rerouting the rivers directly to the North Sea might cause inland flooding if storms raised the sea's level. He also wanted to preserve the Zee's fisheries, and for the new land to be accessible by water.{{r|ley196110}} The ''Dienst der Zuiderzeewerken'' (Zuiderzee Works Department), the government body responsible for overseeing the construction and initial management, was set up in May 1919. It decided against building the main dam first, proceeding to construct a smaller dam, the ''Amsteldiepdijk'', across the Amsteldiep. This was the first step in rejoining the island of [[Wieringen]] to the North Holland mainland. The dike, with a length of 2.5&nbsp;km, was built between 1920 and 1924. As with dike building, polder construction was tested on a small scale at the [[Pilot Polder Andijk|experimental polder at Andijk]].\n\n== Construction phase ==\n\n===Enclosure===\n[[Image:NL-Zuiderzeeworks.svg|right|thumb|The '''Zuiderzee Works''' in the Netherlands divided the dangerous Zuiderzee, a shallow inlet of the North Sea, into the tame lakes of [[IJsselmeer]] and [[Markermeer]], and created 1650&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land.]]\nA new study, commissioned after doubts arose over the financial feasibility of the project, recommended that work should continue and be accelerated. The Zuiderzee Works Department initiated the next two major projects at the same time, in 1927. The most important of these was the main dam, the ''[[Afsluitdijk]]'' (enclosure dam), running from Den Oever on Wieringen to the village of Zurich in Friesland. It was to be 32&nbsp;km long and 90 meters wide, rising to 7.25 meters above sea-level, with an incline of 25% on each side.\n\nExperience showed that [[till]], rather than just sand or clay, was the best primary material for a structure like the Afsluitdijk. An added benefit was that it was easily available; it could be retrieved in large quantities by dredging it from the bottom of the Zuiderzee. Work started at four points: on both sides of the mainland and on two purpose-made construction-islands ([[Kornwerderzand]] and [[Breezanddijk]]) along the line of the future dam.\n\nFrom these points, the dam was expanded as ships deposited till into the open sea in two parallel lines. Sand was poured between these two lines; as the fill emerged above the surface of the water, it was covered by another layer of till. The nascent dam was strengthened with [[basalt]] rocks and mats of [[willow]] switch at its base. The dam was finished by raising it with sand and finally clay for the upper surface of the dam, which was planted with grass.\n\nConstruction progressed better than expected. At three points along the line of the dam were underwater gullies, where the tidal current was much stronger than elsewhere. These had been considered major obstacles to completing the dam but proved not to be so. On May 28, 1932, two years earlier than forecast, the Zuiderzee was closed when the last tidal trench of the ''[[Vlieter]]'' was filled with a bucket of till. The IJsselmeer was born, though the lake still contained salt water at the time.\n\nThe dam was not finished. It still needed to be brought up to its full height, and a road linking Friesland and North Holland remained to be built. In addition to completing the dam, work needed was the construction of shipping [[Canal lock|locks]] and discharge sluices at the ends of the dam. The complex at [[Den Oever]] includes the ''[[Stevin]]'' lock and three series of five sluices for discharging the IJsselmeer into the Wadden Sea. The other complex at Kornwerderzand is composed of the ''[[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]'' locks and two series of five sluices, making a total of 25 discharge sluices. Periodically discharging the lake is necessary since it is continually fed by rivers and streams (most notably the IJssel River, for which the lake is named) and polders draining excess water into the IJsselmeer.\n\nThe Afsluitdijk was opened September 25, 1933, with a monument marking the spot where the dam was finished. It used 23 million m\u00b3 of sand and 13.5 million m\u00b3 of till. An average of 4,000 to 5,000 workers were employed in the dam's construction, relieving unemployment during the [[Great Depression]]. The Total cost of the dam was about [[euro|\u20ac]]700 million (2004 equivalent).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Project\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Dike\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Length\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Start\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Closure\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Size\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Drained\n|-\n|Connection of the island of [[Wieringen]] to continental Holland\n|align=\"center\"|[[Amsteldiepdijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|2.5&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|June 29, 1920\n|align=\"right\"|July 31, 1924\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|-\n|Closure of the [[Zuyderzee]]\n|align=\"center\"|[[Afsluitdijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|32&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|January 1927\n|align=\"right\"|May 23, 1932\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|align=\"right\"|&mdash;\n|-\n|[[Pilot Polder Andijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|1.9&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1926\n|align=\"right\"|Early 1927\n|align=\"right\"|40 ha\n|align=\"right\"|August 27, 1927\n|-\n|[[Wieringermeer]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|18&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1927\n|align=\"right\"|July 27, 1929\n|align=\"right\"|20,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|August 31, 1930\n|-\n|[[Noordoostpolder]]\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|55&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1936\n|align=\"right\"|December 13, 1940\n|align=\"right\"|48,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|September 9, 1942\n|-\n|[[Flevoland|Eastern Flevoland]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|90&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|Early 1950\n|align=\"right\"|September 13, 1956\n|align=\"right\"|54,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|June 29, 1957\n|-\n|[[Flevoland|Southern Flevoland]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|-\n|align=\"center\"|70&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|Early 1959\n|align=\"right\"|October 25, 1967\n|align=\"right\"|43,000 ha\n|align=\"right\"|May 29, 1968\n|-\n|[[Markerwaard]] Polder\n|align=\"center\"|[[Houtribdijk]]\n|align=\"center\"|28&nbsp;km\n|align=\"right\"|1963\n|align=\"right\"|September 4, 1975\n|align=\"right\"|(41,000 ha)\n|align=\"right\"|never done\n|}\n\n===Land reclamation===\nAfter damming off the sea, the next step involved creating new land, known as polders. This was achieved by damming off portions of the IJsselmeer, and then pumping all the water out. The first polder, [[Wieringermeer]], was dammed in 1929 and fully drained in 1930. The third, the [[Noordoostpolder]], was not fully drained until 1942. It was an area much used by the Dutch [[Resistance during World War II|Underground resistance]] during [[World War II]], as the fresh polder offered numerous hiding places.\n\nAfter the war, work was started on draining the Flevolands, a massive project totalling almost 1000&nbsp;km\u00b2. This area is now home to [[Lelystad]] and [[Almere]]; the latter is the fastest growing city in the Netherlands (in part because of its proximity to [[Amsterdam]]). Another large polder was originally planned in the [[Markermeer]]. This project was extensively debated until plans were abandoned in the early 2000s, as environmental issues were viewed differently than in the 1920s. A new province, [[Flevoland]], was created out of the Noordoostpolder and the Flevolands in 1986, thereby completing the Works.\n\nThis new land led to an identity change{{huh|date=November 2018}} for towns including [[Lemmer]], [[Vollenhove]], [[Blokzijl]], the former islands of [[Urk]] and [[Schokland]], [[Wieringen]] and others. [[Kuinre]] suffered{{how|date=November 2018}} particularly because it was cut off from open water.\n\nThe other major project started in 1927 was the construction of the 200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> polder in the northwest, the first and the smallest of the five projected polders. It replaced the [[Wieringermeer]], the body of water south of Wieringen,  and also the name of the new polder. It was the only polder reclaimed from the Zuiderzee itself (the others were reclaimed after the Afsluitdijk was finished), but it wasn't entirely the first. A small test polder of some 0.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was constructed in 1926&ndash;1927 near Andijk in North Holland to research the effects drainage would have on the soil of the Zuiderzee and how best to configure the new polders.\n\nBuilding the encircling dike for the Wieringermeer was harder than it was for the later polders, because the Wieringermeer dikes were built before the completion of the Afsluitdijk. That meant the tidal currents of the Zuiderzee were still present. As a consequence, they were somewhat higher. Construction started on the 18&nbsp;km dike from Den Oever on Wieringen and the new construction-island of Oude Zeug and progressed satisfactorily. The Wieringermeer was closed off from the Zuiderzee in July 1929. The next step was draining all the water from the future polder.\n\nDrainage of a polder is performed by a pumping station or mill (''[[gemaal]]'' in Dutch). Two were built for the Wieringermeer, the ''Leemans'', a [[diesel engine|diesel]] powered station, near Den Oever and the ''Lely'', an electrically powered one, near [[Medemblik]]. Different power systems were used in the stations as a safety  mechanism. If one station lost power, the other one would still be able to keep the polder dry. The pumping mechanism itself was based on a variation of the [[Archimedes' screw]], as designed by [[A. Baldwin Wood]]. The stations, completed in February 1930, managed to drain the polder after six months of continuous pumping. \"Drained\" in this context does not mean the land was wholly dry; extensive pools of shallow water still littered the muddy landscape. To make the soil usable it had to be further drained by a network of drainage canals. Small ditches were dug leading to larger watercourses, which in turn transported their water to the main drainage canals. These canals, dredged when the polder was still filled with water, conducted surplus water to the pumping stations. The resulting dehydration caused the former seabed to sink by over a metre in some places. Once the ground had settled, the smaller ditches were replaced with underground drainage tubes, which would be used for the normal drainage of the polder.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+'''Land Usage of the Polders'''<br>(percentage of total surface area){{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Polder\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Size\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Agriculture\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Housing\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Nature\n|bgcolor=\"lightgrey\"|Infrastructure\n|-\n|Wieringermeer\n|200&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|87%\n|align=\"center\"| 1%\n|align=\"center\"| 3%\n|align=\"center\"|9%\n|-\n|Noordoostpolder\n|480&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|87%\n|align=\"center\"| 1%\n|align=\"center\"| 5%\n|align=\"center\"|7%\n|-\n|Eastern Flevoland\n|540&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|75%\n|align=\"center\"| 8%\n|align=\"center\"|11%\n|align=\"center\"|6%\n|-\n|Southern Flevoland\n|430&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|align=\"center\"|50%\n|align=\"center\"|25%\n|align=\"center\"|18%\n|align=\"center\"|7%\n|}\n\nWith the hydrological infrastructure in place, the virgin land was developed to prepare for its later cultivation. The first plant to establish itself, though more so in the later polders than in the Wieringermeer, was [[Phragmites|reed]], sown from the air by plane onto the muddy flats while the polder was still being drained. This sturdy plant helped evaporate the water and bring air into the soil, thereby solidifying its structure and further preventing the emergence of unwanted weeds.\n\nAfter the first infrastructure was put in place, the reed was burnt and replaced by [[rapeseed]], turning the newborn polder into a yellow sea of flowers in spring. These crops were succeeded by various grains. In the Wieringermeer the first was [[rye]], but the later polders plant wheat, then [[barley]], and finally oats. This process took years, but once finished allowed planting other crops. At the same time, other infrastructures such as roads and housing were built.\n\nThe Wieringermeer and later polders were divided into plots of about {{convert|50|acre}}. The best land is used for vegetables; the next best for rye and other grain; and the worst land is forested. Each plot has a paved road in the front and a canal in the back to make it accessible by land and water. A [[terp]] in the center of the polder is built higher than the highest recorded flood level of the North Sea to protect people if the dike fails; the Wieringermeer terp is large enough to hold the population of Amsterdam.{{r|ley196110}}\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] in World War II the invading forces at first did not interfere; their engineers inspected the project as a model for reclaiming the [[Frische Haff]].{{Citation needed|reason=Link a source backing the claim that Germans intended to reclaim land in the Frische Haff. No source could be found on the internet.|date=October 2018}} In 1945 retreating Germans ordered the [[inundation of the Wieringermeer]], but the damage was repaired.{{r|ley196110}}\n\n==Polders==\n{{No footnotes|section|date=January 2020}}\n===Wieringermeer===\nThe Wieringermeer, as the first of the envisioned five polders, served as a major testbed for ideas and techniques for the following projects. It is closest to the original concept of the new land being primarily used as agricultural land and it has retained a strong rural character. Four villages eventually were formed in the polder: [[Slootdorp]] (1931), [[Middenmeer]] (1933), [[Wieringerwerf]] (1936), and [[Kreileroord]] (1957).\n\nLocal governance presented a new problem. The area was divided among the mainland municipalities according to the boundaries used when it was water-covered. This configuration was not always practical on the ground and unnecessarily split responsibilities among several bodies. The first solution was a form of government called an ''openbaar lichaam'' or \"public body\", a complicated arrangement which incorporated both the government body in charge of the actual development and an appointed committee responsible for public governance. As the polder became more populated, the demand for representation increased until finally on July 1, 1941 the municipality of [[Wieringermeer]] was established.\n[[File:Overstroming van de Wieringmeerpolder. Op 17 april 1945 hebben de Duitsers nog d, Bestanddeelnr 900-3181.jpg|thumb|Flooding of the Wieringermeer following damage to the dykes during World War II]]\nIn the [[Netherlands in World War II#The final year|closing days]] of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] detonated explosives severely damaging the Wieringermeer dike. No casualties were incurred but the polder sank, and the high water and a subsequent storm destroyed most of the infrastructure built in the previous decade. Reconstruction followed quickly and by the end of 1945 the polder was declared drained again and rebuilding the roads, bridges, houses and farms was greatly facilitated by the experience of building them the first time.\n\n=== Noordoostpolder ===\nThe original 1891 plan called for the largest, southeastern polder to be built after the Wieringermeer, but it was decided in 1932 to give precedence to the northeastern one, which was smaller and therefore considered easier. This would be the '''Noordoostpolder''' (''Northeast-polder''). Due to initial financial difficulties, construction did not begin until 1936. Two dikes, totaling 55&nbsp;km in length, steadily grew in the IJsselmeer, one from [[Lemmer]] in Friesland to the island of [[Urk]], the other from [[Vollenhove]] in [[Overijssel]] to Urk. Construction of these dikes and the necessary pumping stations was disrupted during World War II during the 1940 German conquest of the Netherlands. The encircling dikes were both closed in December 1940, and the pumping stations started draining in early 1941. The Noordoostpolder was considered to be sufficiently drained in September 1942, and the developmental process was started for the 480&nbsp;km\u00b2 of new land.\n\nThe task of building the Noordoostpolder was eased by the earlier experience, the now placid waters of the IJsselmeer, and the mechanisation of the construction process. Machines, sometimes made specifically for the Zuiderzee Works, were increasingly used for this and the final polders. Land usage was much the same as in the Wieringermeer, again focusing on farming. Less fertile areas were designated to be planted as forest land. Land in the polders was state-owned during the entire developmental process. Several years after this was completed, the various plots were distributed among private parties, with priority given to the early pioneers who had been in the polder since the start. Later, farmers from all over the Netherlands became eligible for the remainder. Candidates were put through a selection process before receiving their own pieces of new land.\n[[File:Noordoostpolder by Sentinel-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Satellite picture of Noordoostpolder]]\nThe [[North Sea flood of 1953]] made the government change its priorities. Instead of granting the new land only to farmers selected for their skill, the government granted land to a large number of farmers from the flooded province of [[Zeeland]].\n\nThe polder contains two former islands: the glacial [[moraine]] hill of Urk, and the elongated strip of peat land known as [[Schokland]], largely abandoned in the 19th century. Urk was then and is still today a fishing community and it served as a natural construction-island for both dikes as well as a base of operations for the later exploitation of the polder. Both ceased to be islands: Urk on October 3, 1939, when the dike reaching from Lemmer was closed and Schokland when the surrounding water was consequently drained. Both islands stand out in the new land, physically and figuratively. The community of Urk in particular has remained an entity somewhat distinct from the \"mainland\". It is a separate municipality from the rest of the polder, which was organized as the municipality of Noordoostpolder in 1962. The town of [[Kuinre]] was cut off from the open water, losing businesses and status.\n\nAt the heart of the Noordoostpolder, where the three main drainage canals intersect, is the town of [[Emmeloord]] (1943). Planned to be the first and the only major town of the polder, it serves as the local governmental and services center. Ten smaller villages, conceived more as agricultural communities, were planned in a wide circle around Emmeloord, at a distance chosen to be easily covered by  [[bicycle]]. The first settlements were [[Ens (Netherlands)|Ens]], [[Marknesse]] and [[Kraggenburg]] (1949), followed by [[Luttelgeest]] (1950), [[Bant]] (1951), then [[Creil (Netherlands)|Creil]] and [[Rutten (Netherlands)|Rutten]] (1953), and finally [[Espel]], [[Tollebeek]], and [[Nagele]] (1956). From Emmeloord three canals carry their water to three pumping stations, the ''Buma'' near Lemmer, the ''Smeenge'' at Vollenhove, and finally the ''Vissering'' in Urk. The first two are electrically powered (though connected to different power-plants), while the latter one has diesel power. Like all pumping stations of the Zuiderzee Works, they are named for individuals who made significant contributions to the project.\n\n=== The Flevolands ===<!-- This section is linked from [[September 13]] -->\n\n====Eastern Flevoland====\n[[File:Flevopolder by Sentinel-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Zuidelijk and Oostelijk Flevoland (Southern and Eastern Flevoland)]]\nThe period following World War II was spent restoring the Wieringermeerpolder and catching up with work on the Noordoostpolder. Soon attention turned towards the next project: Eastern Flevoland (Oostelijk Flevoland), which at 540&nbsp;km\u00b2 was the largest of the new polders. In 1950 work commenced on several construction-islands in the middle of the IJsselmeer, the largest of which would be Lelystad-Haven, which initially housed a community of dike-builders.\n\nThe experience of the Noordoostpolder had shown that [[groundwater]] from the higher old mainland would flow to the lower new land, causing [[subsidence]] and dehydration in the old land. It was decided to use [[geohydrology]] to detach the new polders from the mainland. A string of peripheral lakes have been left between the two, requiring a much longer dike of 90&nbsp;km to encircle the polder.\n\nThe plans for a single south-eastern polder were changed to construct two separate polders with a joint hydrological infrastructure. They were divided by a dike in the middle, the ''Knardijk'', which would keep one polder safe should the other be flooded. The two main drainage canals to traverse the dike could be closed by [[weir]]s in such a flooding event. The eastern polder was planned to be the first, and the encircling dike began to take form in 1951. It progressed until the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] struck the south-western Netherlands. Workers and machinery were transferred there for repair work (additional work here was part of the [[Delta Works]]).\n\nWork on Eastern Flevoland resumed in 1954 and the dike was closed on September 13, 1956. The pumping stations started draining the polder that same day, completing the task in June 1957. Three were built: the ''Wortman'' (diesel powered) at Lelystad-Haven, the ''Lovink'' near [[Harderwijk]] and the ''Colijn'' (both electrically powered) along the northern dike beside the Ketelmeer. All three were built with extra capacity with the future southern polder in mind.\n\nA new element in the design of this polder was the intention to establish a larger city to serve as a regional centre for all the polders and perhaps the capital of a potential new [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]]. This city, located in the centre of the reclaimed lands, was developed as [[Lelystad]] (1966), named after the man who had played a crucial role in the design and realisation of the Zuiderzee Works. Other more conventional settlements had already developed by then; Dronten, the local major town, was founded in 1962, followed in 1963 by two smaller satellite villages, Swifterbant and Biddinghuizen. These last three were incorporated into the new municipality of [[Dronten]] on January 1, 1972. Lelystad was large enough to be organized as a separate municipality on January 1, 1980.\n\nThough agriculture was initially the main purpose of the polder, needs of the post-war period changed the design goals of the new polders. Changing agricultural needs and increased motorised mobility meant many farming villages were unnecessary and the number of towns was eventually reduced to two. Work on the village of Larsen was just about to start when it was cancelled. The amount of agricultural land did not increase; it diminished as a result of the building of Lelystad (a city envisioned to eventually house at least 100,000 inhabitants.) By 2005 it had 70,000 residents. In addition, more area was assigned for development as forests and nature reserves, a trend that would continue in the next polder. \n\n====Southern Flevoland ====\nSouthern Flevoland (Zuidelijk Flevoland) was the fourth polder of the Zuiderzee Works, built adjacent to its larger sibling, Eastern Flevoland. Since its northeastern dike, the aforementioned Knardijk, already existed, only 70&nbsp;km of the dike remained to be built. Starting in early 1959, this was finished in October 1967.\n\nOnly one pumping station ('gemaal'), the diesel powered ''De Blocq van Kuffeler'', needed to be built because of the hydrological union of the two Flevolands; once the polder was finished it would simply join the previous three in maintaining the water-level of both polders. Before it could do that however the newest ''gemaal'' had to first drain the 430&nbsp;km\u00b2 polder of its water all by itself, completing its job in May 1968.\n\nDue to the geographically favourable location of the southern polder to the heavily urbanised centre of the Netherlands and in particular [[Amsterdam]], the planners devised a design that would include a large new urban area, to be called [[Almere]], in order to relieve the housing shortage and increasing overcrowding on the old land. Almere was to be divided into 3 major settlements, initially; the first, Almere-Haven (1976), situated along the [[Gooimeer]] (one of the peripheral lakes), the second and largest, Almere-Stad (''Almere City'') (1980), which was to fulfil the role of city centre, and the third, Almere-Buiten (1984), to the northeast towards Lelystad.\n\nThe area between Lelystad and Almere was designated for heavy industries, but since enough space was still available on the old land for those industries this part of the polder was left alone for the mean time. After only a couple of years this landscape of shallow pools, islets and swamps became a popular resting and foraging area for many species of waterfowl, to the extent that it rapidly turned into a nature reserve of national significance. Although accidental in origin, the ''[[Oostvaardersplassen]]'' as they are known became by the 1970s the definitive destination for this section of the polder.\n\nThe centre of the polder most closely resembles the pre-war polders in that it is almost exclusively agricultural. In contrast, the south-eastern part is dominated by extensive forests. It is also home to the only other settlement of the polder, [[Zeewolde]] (1984), again a more conventional town acting as the local centre. Zeewolde became a municipality at the same time as Almere, on January 1, 1984, which in the case of Zeewolde meant that the municipality existed before the town itself, with only farms in the surrounding land to be governed until the town started to grow.\n\n=== Markerwaard ===\nMarkerwaard is a planned fifth polder that has never been completed. It was intended to build a south-western polder, to be called the [[Markerwaard]], at several times during the project, but other polders took precedence. Parts of it have been built; in 1941 it was decided to begin work on the first section of dike, but the German occupiers stopped construction that same year. This dike originated on [[Marken]], the last of the IJsselmeer islands, and went north for some 2&nbsp;km where it ends abruptly today. After World War II, the eastern polder was chosen as the next project, but Marken was not wholly ignored; on October 17, 1957 a 3.5&nbsp;km long dike was closed, running south of the now former island to the [[North Holland]] mainland.\n[[File:Markerwaard 1981.jpg|thumb|upright|Markerwaard as envisioned in 1981]]\nWhen construction started in 1959 on a new dike it had not yet been decided whether this would be the northern dike of Southern Flevoland or the southern dike of the Markerwaard, but the choice eventually fell to the former and another chance for the Markerwaard had passed. A minor flood near Amsterdam in 1960 had demonstrated the danger a large IJsselmeer still presented. A further planned element of the Markerwaard was subsequently executed: a 28&nbsp;km dike between Lelystad and [[Enkhuizen]], including two complexes of locks and discharge sluices at either end, was to split the IJsselmeer in two, with the largest portion (1250&nbsp;km\u00b2) continuing as the IJsselmeer and the smaller lake (700&nbsp;km\u00b2) being named the [[Markermeer]]. Construction of this dike, known later as the ''[[Houtribdijk]]'' or '''Markerwaarddijk''', progressed slowly, lasting from 1963 to 1975, after which it also served as an important road connection between the north of North Holland and the eastern Netherlands. The Houtribdijk did not, however, result in the construction of the rest of the Markerwaard, as many had hoped.\n\nThe debate on whether to build the Markerwaard continued for years. The need for new agricultural land had mostly disappeared by this time and extra space for housing was unnecessary in this region. The existing ecological and recreational value of the Markermeer was considered by many to be equal or superior to any potential such value the Markerwaard would offer. Doubts began to surface about the cost-effectiveness of the polder. The original post-war designs had called for a 410&nbsp;km\u00b2 polder, yet many different proposals were later put forth in an effort to combine the benefits of both the Markerwaard and Markermeer, all to no avail. Although [[cabinet (government)|cabinets]] had intended to proceed with the Markerwaard, it was decided to indefinitely postpone the project in September 1986. A proposed alternative was to use the lake as a water reservoir for hydropower combined with wind-power from windmills on the dikes, eliminating the unpredictability of the latter&nbsp;\u2013 when there is an overcapacity of wind, use that to fill the lake and when there is not enough, use the high water level for hydro power.\n\nIn 2012, plans emerged to create the [[Marker Wadden]],<ref>[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-10683.html Intentieverklaring Marker Wadden, Rijkswaterstaat], Dutch government bulletin, April 2013</ref> a group of islands designed to establish nature reserves in the north of the Markermeer. Contrary to the Markerwaard, no human occupation is planned, although it will be accessible to tourists and [[ornithology|birdwatchers]]. The creation process started in April 2016 with the first new island being inaugurated on 24 September 2016<ref>https://nos.nl/artikel/2134152-een-nieuw-stukje-nederland-de-marker-wadden-zijn-open.html</ref>.\n\n==Province of [[Flevoland]]==\nThe loss of the Markerwaard did not affect plans to create a new [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] out of the polders. The older [[Wieringermeer]] in the north, long since part of [[North Holland]], would not become a part of it, but the municipalities of the other three and the islands of the Noordoostpolder would together form the 12th province of the Netherlands, called [[Flevoland]]. The need for a new province was not immediately clear; Urk and the Noordoostpolder had been part of [[Overijssel]] up to that point and Dronten fell under [[Gelderland]]. After the new municipalities of Southern Flevoland were established in 1984, belonging to no province as was the case with Lelystad, the provincial issue required renewed attention. With only six municipalities and without the Markerwaard, the area was considered by opponents to be insufficiently populous and developed for an entire province, but the polder municipalities were unanimous in their desire: on January 1, 1986 the province of Flevoland was inaugurated. With a population of 356,400 (2004) it was the least populous province, but the province of [[Zeeland]] had only 378,300 and Flevoland has a higher population density than four other provinces. By 2015, Flevoland had surpassed Zeeland in population (403,380, compared to 380,620) and had a density of 280 persons per square kilometre.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Plan Kloppenburg en Faggedon.jpg|Plan Kloppenburg en Faggedon<br />(1848)\nImage:Plan Van Diggelen.jpg|Plan Van Diggelen<br />(1849)\nImage:Plan Beyerinck.jpg|Plan Beyerinck<br /> (1866)\nImage:Plan Stieltjes.jpg|Plan Stieltjes<br /> (1870-1873)\nImage:Planlely.jpg| Original Plan Lely<br /> (date unknown)\nImage:Zuiderzeewerken - Lely plan.jpg|Plan Lely<br /> (1891)\nImage:Zuiderzeewerken proposal 1907.jpg|Plan Zuiderzeewerken<br /> (1907)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Delta Works]] for another major waterworks project in the Netherlands.\n*[[Lauwersmeer|Lauwerszee Works]]\n* [[Flood control in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Flood]]\n* [[Zuiderzeemuseum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Zuiderzee Works}}\n*[http://www.nieuwlanderfgoed.nl/ Nieuw Land Poldermuseum]&nbsp;\u2013 A Flevoland museum on the Zuiderzee Works and Dutch water management in general.\n*[http://www.zuiderzeemuseum.nl/ The Zuiderzee Museum]&nbsp;\u2013 Dedicated to the history and culture of the former Zuiderzee.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20021001182551/http://www.waterland.net/rdij/index_uk.htm Directorate IJsselmeer Region]&nbsp;\u2013 The administration responsible for maintaining most of the Zuiderzee Works.\n*[http://www.holland-cycling.com/where-to-go/long-distance-cycle-routes/national-long-distance-cycle-network/zuider-sea-route-zuiderzeeroute Zuiderzee Cycle Route], long-distance cycle route around the former Zuiderzee.\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n[[Category:20th century in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:History of science and technology in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Causeways in Europe]]\n[[Category:Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n[[Category:Dams in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Dikes in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Flood control in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Zuiderzee Works| ]]\n[[Category:Dams completed in 1924]]\n[[Category:Polders of North Holland]]\n[[Category:Polders of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Polders of Flevoland]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Friesland]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works"}
