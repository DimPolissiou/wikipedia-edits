It was one of the first hotels built outside of the city's downtown business district in a then residential neighborhood, which had been land originally owned by [[Richard Peters (Atlanta)|Richard Peters]].\n\nAt a cost of $500,000, the hotel was built of butter-colored brick, marble, and limestone in the Beaux-Arts style as a Southern interpretation of the Parisian hotel. The hotel features classical architectural details, such as [[turret]]ed corners, floor-to-ceiling [[Palladian architecture|Palladian-styled]] windows, and wide wrap-around columned [[terrace (architecture)|terraces]]. The hotel is largely unadorned until its [[cornice]] line, which is embellished by highly-decorative [[terracotta]].\n\nThe Peachtree Street fa\u00e7ade is composed of a two-story high window arcade set under a wide cornice supported on narrow [[pilaster]]s and has a centered [[portico]]. The Ponce de Leon Avenue fa\u00e7ade features a portico held up by four columns that rest on a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]], arcaded base. This portico was used as the Ladies Carriage entrance and provided access to the main hotel; the caf\u00e9 terrace, which held exotic plants, tables, and chairs to resemble cafes in Europe; and a lower level of the hotel, which at one time housed the WAKE 1340AM radio station.\n\nOriginally, the hotel had a prominent, tile-buttressed, shed roof cornice that was supported by ornamented, paired brackets, but this element was removed in 1945.\n\nThe inside of the hotel was decorated with crystal and Italian-bronze [[chandelier]]s, white marble columns, ornate pilasters, paneled walls, elliptical staircases, and Italian-tiled floors. In addition to guest rooms, the hotel housed the Winter Garden, the Terrace Garden Lounging Room, which was almost entirely enclosed in glass, the Terrace Restaurant Grill Room, general management offices, an elevator, telephone booths, a curio booth, an \"oak-mission\" decorated [[Rathskeller]], barber shops, a manicure parlor, and an ornate ballroom that was the setting for the 1939 ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Gala.\n\nAll of the hotel's original furniture and interior furnishings were from M. Rich and Brothers Co., later [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Atlanta Historic Resources Workbook'' by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission, September 1981</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta'': University of Georgia Press, 1993</ref><ref name=\"Commercial District Tour Guide PC\">Atlanta Preservation Center's ''SoNo/Midtown Commercial District Tour Guide'': APC, 2009</ref><ref name=\"atlantaga.gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/urbandesign_georgianterr.aspx/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035941/http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/urbandesign_georgianterr.aspx# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''The Ponce Lobby'' by Richard Flinn, Director of Restoration for The Fox Theatre; 1981?, [Atlanta?], Ga.: n.p.</ref><ref>''Rich's of Atlanta: The Story of a Store since 1867'' by Henry Givens Baker, 1953, Foote and Davies</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn October 2, 1911, thousands of guests from Atlanta and other cities attended the opening night ceremonies of the Georgian Terrace Hotel, where they were entertained by a costumed-Spanish orchestra performing in the Grand Ballroom. Immediately, guests and the press dubbed the hotel as a \"distinct step forward in Southern hoteldom\" and a \"Parisian hotel on a noted boulevard in a metropolitan city\". Over subsequent decades, the hotel would be referred to as the \"Grand Old Lady of Peachtree\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nSince its opening, the hotel has been the place for numerous historical events and housed several prominent guests, including [[Clark Gable]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[John J. Pershing]], [[Walt Disney]], and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].\n\nStarting in 1913, famous Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] along with members of [[The Metropolitan Opera]] used the hotel as their Atlanta headquarters when they came yearly to the city to perform in spring concerts. Once the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] opened across the street from the hotel in 1929, traffic on Peachtree Street would be stopped and a red carpet rolled from the door of the hotel to the theatre entrance, allowing the opera stars and other celebrities staying at the hotel to make a grand entrance into the theatre before their shows started.\n\n[[File:Front of Georgian Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Historic Front Entrance]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Arthur Murray]], who was then a student at [[Georgia Tech]], started teaching dance classes in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. This enterprise eventually spawned his franchised-branded dance lesson business. In 1926, Georgia's chief investigator for the Solicitor General, Bert Donaldson, was murdered at the hotel. It was thought that this planned \"hit\" was evidence of Atlanta's underworld connections to [[organized crime]].\n\nIn 1935, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] editor Harold Latham decided to stay at the hotel while scouting the Atlanta area for new writers and manuscripts. While in town, he met Peggy Mitchell Marsh, whom he was introduced to through a mutual acquaintance. This mutual acquaintance also had told Latham that Marsh had written a novel about Atlanta during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. After several failed attempts to obtain the manuscript from Marsh, Latham finally succeeded in getting it from her in the lobby of the hotel as he was about to depart for [[New Orleans]]. Upon handing the manuscript to Latham, Marsh said, \"If you really want it you may take it, but it is incomplete and unrevised.\"<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by [[Anne Edwards]], 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref> That unfinished novel was completed and published in 1936 as ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1937. While she insisted on using her married name socially, the book was published under her maiden name of [[Margaret Mitchell]].<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by Anne Edwards, 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 1939, the Georgian Terrace Hotel's Grand Ballroom was the site of the ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Gala, whose attendees included [[Clark Gable]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Victor Fleming]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], [[David O. Selznick]], Margaret Mitchell, and several other notable guests.\n\nThe premiere of Gone with the Wind was in Atlanta in 1939. All of the stars and the Director of the movie (with the exception of Vivien Leigh and her lover at the time, Lawrence Olivier) stayed at the Georgian Terrace. The pre-premiere party was held at the hotel.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the premier showing of ''Gone With the Wind'' was not held at the Fox Theatre, but rather at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] in downtown Atlanta. After the movie was screened there, its stars were ushered to the Georgian Terrace via a motorcade through a parade route on Peachtree Street.\n\nDuring the premiere of ''[[Song of the South]]'', which did take place at the Fox Theatre, [[Walt Disney]] stayed at the hotel. He returned to his room before the film started; unexpected audience reactions of any kind upset him and he preferred not to watch it with the audience.\n\nThe Georgian Terrace Hotel saw quite a few changes in the 1940s. It had become a residential hotel in 1945 and had been modernized with air-conditioning, new plumbing, and some interior changes. In 1945, the prominent tile-buttressed, shed roof cornice was removed.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Grand Ballroom was turned into the [[Alex Cooley's Electric Ballroom|Electric Ballroom]] by concert promoters Alex Cooley and Mark Golob. Musical performers providing concerts at the hotel included [[Billy Joel]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The 1974 film ''[[Cockfighter]]'', starring [[Warren Oates]], features some scenes that were shot at the Georgian Terrace.<ref>''Warren Oates: a wild life'' by Susan Compo, 2009, The University Press of Kentucky</ref>\n\nBy 1981, revenues were in steady decline and the hotel closed its doors for the first time in its 70-year history. By the middle of that decade, the hotel had been boarded up and condemned. In 1986, however, the hotel was listed as a part of the \"Fox Theatre District\" on the National Register of Historic Places, which successfully blocked plans for its demolition.\n\nThe 1990s saw a rebirth of the hotel. In 1991, the hotel was converted into a luxury apartment building, and a new 19-story wing complete with a roof-top pool was built to resemble the original 10-story Beaux-Arts-style hotel. In 1997, the apartments were vacated, and the property reopened as a luxury hotel.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century has seen two major renovations done at the hotel, one in 2000 and one in 2009, which included the opening of Livingston's Restaurant and Bar and Mims Caf\u00e9, both named after early Atlanta Mayor [[Livingston Mims]], who had built his house in 1879 on the corner where the hotel now stands.\n\nIn April 2007, the hotel was used by [[Robert Rodriguez]] to film a [[Bacardi|Bacardi Global Brands]] commercial for the European market titled [http://www.youtubekeep.com/watch-video/el-toro-starring-george-clooney-60sec-generic-s/122656/ El Toro]. This commercial starred [[George Clooney]], Jamie King, and [[Leonor Varela]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the Georgian Terrace's Grand Ballroom was used as a filming location for the [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] film ''[[The Change-Up]]''.

It was one of the first hotels built outside of the city's downtown business district in a then residential neighborhood, which had been land originally owned by [[Richard Peters (Atlanta)|Richard Peters]].\n\nAt a cost of $500,000, the hotel was built of butter-colored brick, marble, and limestone in the Beaux-Arts style as a Southern interpretation of the Parisian hotel. The hotel features classical architectural details, such as [[turret]]ed corners, floor-to-ceiling [[Palladian architecture|Palladian-styled]] windows, and wide wrap-around columned [[terrace (architecture)|terraces]]. The hotel is largely unadorned until its [[cornice]] line, which is embellished by highly-decorative [[terracotta]].\n\nThe Peachtree Street fa\u00e7ade is composed of a two-story high window arcade set under a wide cornice supported on narrow [[pilaster]]s and has a centered [[portico]]. The Ponce de Leon Avenue fa\u00e7ade features a portico held up by four columns that rest on a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]], arcaded base. This portico was used as the Ladies Carriage entrance and provided access to the main hotel; the caf\u00e9 terrace, which held exotic plants, tables, and chairs to resemble cafes in Europe; and a lower level of the hotel, which at one time housed the WAKE 1340AM radio station.\n\nOriginally, the hotel had a prominent, tile-buttressed, shed roof cornice that was supported by ornamented, paired brackets, but this element was removed in 1945.\n\nThe inside of the hotel was decorated with crystal and Italian-bronze [[chandelier]]s, white marble columns, ornate pilasters, paneled walls, elliptical staircases, and Italian-tiled floors. In addition to guest rooms, the hotel housed the Winter Garden, the Terrace Garden Lounging Room, which was almost entirely enclosed in glass, the Terrace Restaurant Grill Room, general management offices, an elevator, telephone booths, a curio booth, an \"oak-mission\" decorated [[Rathskeller]], barber shops, a manicure parlor, and an ornate ballroom that was the setting for the 1939 ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Gala.\n\nAll of the hotel's original furniture and interior furnishings were from M. Rich and Brothers Co., later [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Atlanta Historic Resources Workbook'' by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission, September 1981</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta'': University of Georgia Press, 1993</ref><ref name=\"Commercial District Tour Guide PC\">Atlanta Preservation Center's ''SoNo/Midtown Commercial District Tour Guide'': APC, 2009</ref><ref name=\"atlantaga.gov\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/urbandesign_georgianterr.aspx/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528035941/http://www.atlantaga.gov/government/urbandesign_georgianterr.aspx# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">''The Ponce Lobby'' by Richard Flinn, Director of Restoration for The Fox Theatre; 1981?, [Atlanta?], Ga.: n.p.</ref><ref>''Rich's of Atlanta: The Story of a Store since 1867'' by Henry Givens Baker, 1953, Foote and Davies</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn October 2, 1911, thousands of guests from Atlanta and other cities attended the opening night ceremonies of the Georgian Terrace Hotel, where they were entertained by a costumed-Spanish orchestra performing in the Grand Ballroom. Immediately, guests and the press dubbed the hotel as a \"distinct step forward in Southern hoteldom\" and a \"Parisian hotel on a noted boulevard in a metropolitan city\". Over subsequent decades, the hotel would be referred to as the \"Grand Old Lady of Peachtree\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nSince its opening, the hotel has been the place for numerous historical events and housed several prominent guests, including [[Clark Gable]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[John J. Pershing]], [[Walt Disney]], and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].\n\nStarting in 1913, famous Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] along with members of [[The Metropolitan Opera]] used the hotel as their Atlanta headquarters when they came yearly to the city to perform in spring concerts. Once the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] opened across the street from the hotel in 1929, traffic on Peachtree Street would be stopped and a red carpet rolled from the door of the hotel to the theatre entrance, allowing the opera stars and other celebrities staying at the hotel to make a grand entrance into the theatre before their shows started.\n\n[[File:Front of Georgian Terrace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Historic Front Entrance]]\nIn the 1920s, [[Arthur Murray]], who was then a student at [[Georgia Tech]], started teaching dance classes in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. This enterprise eventually spawned his franchised-branded dance lesson business. In 1926, Georgia's chief investigator for the Solicitor General, Bert Donaldson, was murdered at the hotel. It was thought that this planned \"hit\" was evidence of Atlanta's underworld connections to [[organized crime]].\n\nIn 1935, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] editor Harold Latham decided to stay at the hotel while scouting the Atlanta area for new writers and manuscripts. While in town, he met Peggy Mitchell Marsh, whom he was introduced to through a mutual acquaintance. This mutual acquaintance also had told Latham that Marsh had written a novel about Atlanta during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. After several failed attempts to obtain the manuscript from Marsh, Latham finally succeeded in getting it from her in the lobby of the hotel as he was about to depart for [[New Orleans]]. Upon handing the manuscript to Latham, Marsh said, \"If you really want it you may take it, but it is incomplete and unrevised.\"<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by [[Anne Edwards]], 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref> That unfinished novel was completed and published in 1936 as ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1937. While she insisted on using her married name socially, the book was published under her maiden name of [[Margaret Mitchell]].<ref>''Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell'' by Anne Edwards, 1983, Ticknor & Fields</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 1939, the Georgian Terrace Hotel's Grand Ballroom was the site of the ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' Gala, whose attendees included [[Clark Gable]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Victor Fleming]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], [[David O. Selznick]], Margaret Mitchell, and several other notable guests.\n\nThe premiere of Gone with the Wind was in Atlanta in 1939. All of the stars and the Director of the movie (with the exception of Vivien Leigh and her lover at the time, Lawrence Olivier) stayed at the Georgian Terrace. The pre-premiere party was held at the hotel.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the premier showing of ''Gone With the Wind'' was not held at the Fox Theatre, but rather at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] in downtown Atlanta. After the movie was screened there, its stars were ushered to the Georgian Terrace via a motorcade through a parade route on Peachtree Street.\n\nDuring the premiere of ''[[Song of the South]]'', which did take place at the Fox Theatre, [[Walt Disney]] stayed at the hotel. He returned to his room before the film started; unexpected audience reactions of any kind upset him and he preferred not to watch it with the audience.\n\nThe Georgian Terrace Hotel saw quite a few changes in the 1940s. It had become a residential hotel in 1945 and had been modernized with air-conditioning, new plumbing, and some interior changes. In 1945, the prominent tile-buttressed, shed roof cornice was removed.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Grand Ballroom was turned into the [[Alex Cooley's Electric Ballroom|Electric Ballroom]] by concert promoters Alex Cooley and Mark Golob. Musical performers providing concerts at the hotel included [[Billy Joel]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The 1974 film ''[[Cockfighter]]'', starring [[Warren Oates]], features some scenes that were shot at the Georgian Terrace.<ref>''Warren Oates: a wild life'' by Susan Compo, 2009, The University Press of Kentucky</ref>\n\nBy 1981, revenues were in steady decline and the hotel closed its doors for the first time in its 70-year history. By the middle of that decade, the hotel had been boarded up and condemned. In 1986, however, the hotel was listed as a part of the \"Fox Theatre District\" on the National Register of Historic Places, which successfully blocked plans for its demolition.\n\nThe 1990s saw a rebirth of the hotel. In 1991, the hotel was converted into a luxury apartment building, and a new 19-story wing complete with a roof-top pool was built to resemble the original 10-story Beaux-Arts-style hotel. In 1997, the apartments were vacated, and the property reopened as a luxury hotel.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century has seen two major renovations done at the hotel, one in 2000 and one in 2009, which included the opening of Livingston's Restaurant and Bar and Mims Caf\u00e9, both named after early Atlanta Mayor [[Livingston Mims]], who had built his house in 1879 on the corner where the hotel now stands.\n\nIn April 2007, the hotel was used by [[Robert Rodriguez]] to film a [[Bacardi|Bacardi Global Brands]] commercial for the European market titled [http://www.youtubekeep.com/watch-video/el-toro-starring-george-clooney-60sec-generic-s/122656/ El Toro]. This commercial starred [[George Clooney]], Jamie King, and [[Leonor Varela]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2010, the Georgian Terrace's Grand Ballroom was used as a filming location for the [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] film ''[[The Change-Up]]''.

Voiced by American actress [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], Ursula is a villainous [[sea witch]] who offers a [[mermaid]] princess named [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]] in exchange to trade her voice for a pair of human legs, at first appearing to be providing the character with an opportunity to become human by temporarily transforming her into one so that she may earn the love of [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters|Prince Eric]] within three days. However, Ursula is, in fact, determined to sabotage Ariel's chances so that she can ultimately replace [[King Triton (The Little Mermaid)|King Triton]] as ruler over Atlantica.\n\nCreated by directors and screenwriters [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], Ursula is based on the sea witch character who appears in the fairy tale \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. However, her minor role was greatly expanded into that of a much more prominent villain for the film. Disney had struggled to cast Ursula for a year, during which the role was well sought after by several coveted television actresses at the time. Clements and Musker disagreed with lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] about who should voice the character. While the directors had written the role with [[Bea Arthur]] in mind, Ashman intended to offer it to [[soap opera]] star [[Joan Collins]]; both actresses rejected the part. When Ashman cast his second choice, Broadway actress [[Elaine Stritch]], as Ursula, both stage veterans disagreed about the manner in which Ursula's song \"[[Poor Unfortunate Souls]]\" would be performed, and [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] was finally hired to replace Stritch after Ashman fired her. Deepening her own voice for the role, Carroll based her performance on a combination of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actresses and [[Car salesman|car salespeople]].\n\nAnimated by [[Ruben A. Aquino]], Ursula's original design was inspired by several different [[Marine biology|sea creatures]], including [[manta ray]]s and [[Scorpaeniformes|scorpion fish]], before Clements finally decided to base the character on an [[octopus]]; her number of [[tentacle]]s was reduced from eight to six for financial reasons. Ursula's appearance was also inspired by American actor and drag queen [[Divine (performer)|Divine]]. When ''The Little Mermaid'' was first released in 1989, Ursula was immediately embraced as one of Disney's best villains, and continues to be ranked highly among the studio's greatest by the media. Praised for being humorous and frightening, the character has garnered positive reviews from film critics, some of whom dubbed her Disney's strongest villain in decades. Meanwhile, Carroll's performance has garnered similar acclaim to the point that the role has eclipsed her previous body of work, ultimately becoming virtually synonymous with the character. \u2018This one longing to be thinner this one wants to get the girl do I help them yes indeed \n    Poor Unfortunate Souls \nSorry I was bored in quarantine\n\n==Development==\n\n===Conception and writing===\nAt the behest of Disney executives [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], director and screenwriter [[Ron Clements]] was among several filmmakers instructed to research new story ideas that could potentially be adapted into the studio's next major animated film release.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/moviemom/2013/09/interview-ron-clements-john-musker-little-mermaid-disney.html|title=Interview: Ron Clements and John Musker of \"The Little Mermaid\"|last=Minow|first=Nell|date=|website=Beliefnet|publisher=Beliefnet, Inc|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> Clements first discovered [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s classic fairy tale \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" at a local bookstore, and began deliberating why Disney had never attempted to adapt the story before.<ref name=\":2\" /> Clements eventually learned that [[Walt Disney]] himself had actually attempted to adapt the fairy tale into a feature-length animated film as early as the 1930s,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/2014/11/14/the-little-mermaid-facts/|title='The Little Mermaid' Facts: 25 Things You Didn't Know About the Disney Masterpiece|last=Susman|first=Gary|date=November 14, 2014|website=Moviefone|publisher=Aol Inc|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> but the project was ultimately shelved due in part to its sad ending.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/03/15/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-little-mermaid-5104832/|title=10 things you probably didn\u2019t know about The Little Mermaid|last=Duncan|first=Amy|date=March 15, 2010|website=Metro|publisher=|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> Clements suggested \"The Little Mermaid\" to Katzenberg, who finally [[Green-light|green-lit]] it after having first rejected it.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHardly present in Andersen's original story,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emgn.com/entertainment/15-exciting-facts-about-the-little-mermaid-you-never-knew/|title=15 Exciting Facts About The Little Mermaid You Never Knew!|last=|first=|date=|website=EMGN|publisher=|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> the [[sea witch]] is not a prominent character and lacks a [[proper name]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2014/08/16/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-little-mermaid/|title=15 THINGS YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MERMAID|last=Brandon|first=Emily|date=2014|website=Oh My Disney|publisher=Disney|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> Among Clements' ideas to alter the story, the filmmaker decided to \"make the witch more of a villain\", describing Ursula as \"a fun character to develop\" into such.<ref name=\":2\" /> In Andersen's tale, the sea witch is not a villain as much as she is \"a disreputable mermaid.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disneyvillains.net/Ursula.php|title=Ursula \u2013 The Little Mermaid (1989)|last=|first=|date=|website=Disney Villains|publisher=Disney Villains|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> JR Thorpe of ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' agreed that, in Andersen's story, \"The sea witch isn't the enemy\".

Television]] on the sitcom ''[[The Golden Girls]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, Arthur's agent resented the directors-writers for insinuating that her client voice a witch,<ref name=\":1\" /> refusing to even present the script to the actress.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith Arthur eliminated, Clements and Musker were forced to audition several other popular television actresses of the decade, including [[Nancy Marchand]], [[Charlotte Rae]] and [[Roseanne Barr]],<ref name=\":0\" /> the last of whom had originally auditioned for the supporting role of chambermaid Carlotta.<ref name=\":11\"/> Amused by her [[nasal voice]], Howard invited the comedian to read for Ursula, but concluded that her approach was ultimately not suitable for the character.<ref name=\":12\"/> Jazz singer [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]] also auditioned.<ref name=\":1\" /> Meanwhile, Ashman himself had been similarly unsuccessful in recruiting Collins because ''Dynasty'' producer [[Aaron Spelling]] feared that the actress' reputation would be jeopardized should she voice an animated character.<ref name=\":1\" /> Thus, Ashman pursued [[Musical theatre|Broadway]] veteran [[Elaine Stritch]], of whom he had been a long-time fan.<ref name=\":0\" /> The audition process for Ursula required each hopeful to both recite a scene from the film and perform a Broadway-style song of their choice.<ref

experience creative differences over \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" because the actress refused to follow the lyricist's \"very specific directions\".<ref name=\":0\" /> After refusing to perform the song

she had always wanted to voice a [[Disney characters|Disney character]].<ref name=\":10\" /> However, the actress felt that her chances were slim to none upon realizing that her competition largely consisted of famous film and television actresses.<ref name=\":0\" /> Musker described Carroll's audition approach as a hybrid of actors [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]].<ref name=\":12\" /> Although confident in both her acting and singing auditions,<ref name=\":10\" /> Carroll did not hear back from her agent about the role until a year afterward, by which time she had already forgotten she had ever auditioned.<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon being cast, Carroll was entirely committed to the role, giving it complete precedence over all other jobs and projects at the time.<ref name=\":10\" /> Carroll's first task was to record \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", her approach to which was remarkably different than Stritch's, first asking Howard to demonstrate exactly how he would like her to perform the song before attempting it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Carroll completely credits Ashman with her delivery,<ref name=\":4\" /> explaining, \"I got the whole attitude from him ... and his shoulders would twitch a certain way, and his eyes would go a certain way ... I got more about that character from Howard singing that song than from anything else.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Carroll also borrowed Ursula's habit of saying \"innit\" instead of \"isn't it\" from Ashman.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite their strong working relationship, Carroll described working with Ashman and composer [[Alan Menken]] as a \"brutal\" experience because of the songwriters' \"military\" approach; she would often return home from recording sessions with blown vocal chords.<ref name=\":0\" /> Carroll recalled her daughter, filmmaker [[Tara Karsian]], reassuring her that \"you're in something that fifty years from now may be shown ... What you're working on now will be seen by our children, and our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren\" after complaining to her about one of her recording sessions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Describing her own performance as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]], Carroll perceived Ursula as an \"ex-Shakespearean actress who now sold cars\", which inspired her dry, theatrical interpretation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Carroll also deepened her own voice for the role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/making_littlemermaid.htm|title=Making Of...The Little Mermaid Behind The Scenes|website=The 80s Movies Rewind|publisher=Fast-Rewind.com|access-date=April 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107050713/http://www.fast-rewind.com/making_littlemermaid.htm|archive-date=November 7, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> When Carroll watched the completed film for the first time, she was frightened by her own performance, comparing it to actress [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]'s performance as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).<ref name=\":10\" /> Actress [[Jodi Benson]], who voices Ariel, briefly provides the voice of \"Vanessa\", Ursula's beautiful human [[Alter ego|alter-ego]], in lieu of Carroll.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/this-little-mermaid-has-l_b_4323101.html|title=This \u2018Little Mermaid\u2019 Has Legs: Disney Legend Jodi Benson Looks Back on 25 Years of Voicing the Character of Ariel|last=Hill|first=Jim|date=November 22, 2013|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc|access-date=April 2, 2016}}</ref> With the writing and recording of \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", Ursula became the first Disney villainness to receive her own song.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/wide-screen/ranking-the-12-most-famous-disney-villains-from-worst-to-best-185848655.html|title=Ranking the 12 most famous Disney villains from worst to best|last=Perkins|first=Will|date=May 29, 2014|website=Yahoo!

When Ariel saves and falls in love with a human named Prince Eric much to her father's chagrin, Ursula temporarily grants Ariel's wish to live as a human for three days in return for her voice. If she successfully earns a kiss from Eric by the end of the third day, Ariel will remain human permanently; if she fails, she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula forever. However, Ursula is determined to sabotage Ariel's and Eric's budding romance at any cost; when she realizes that Ariel and Eric are falling in love, Ursula transforms herself into a beautiful young woman named \"Vanessa\" and hypnotizes Eric, tricking him into agreeing to marry her instead. Ariel manages to thwart Ursula and Eric's wedding. Eric realizes that it was Ariel who saved him when her voice returns to her and is about to kiss her, but as the sun sets Ariel transforms back into a mermaid and is captured by Ursula. Triton confronts Ursula and agrees to give up himself and his magical trident in return for Ariel's freedom. Ursula then uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions and attempts to kill Ariel and Eric, but Eric manages to impale Ursula with the splintered bowsprit of a wrecked ship, and she dies. With Ursula defeated, her power's cease, the merpeople turn back to normal, Triton's power is restored, and Ariel marries Eric once she is permanently transformed into a human.\n\n===Television series===\n{{main|The Little Mermaid (TV series)}}\nUrsula appears as the antagonist in four episodes of ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'' prequel television series: \"Against the Tide\", \"Tail of Two Crabs\", \"Heroes\" and \"Ariel's Treasures\". In all four episodes, she executes various plans to antagonize King Triton and take over Atlantica, but all fail.  \n\n===''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea''===\n{{Main|The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea}}\n\nUrsula does not appear in the direct-to-video film ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' because she is killed in the first film, but she is mentioned many times, mostly by her younger sister [[Morgana (The Little Mermaid)|Morgana]], also voiced by Pat Carroll. In the family portrait during the cut song \"Gonna Get My Wish\", Ursula was also depicted with light green skin similar to Morgana and their mother.\n\n==In other media==\nUrsula appears in Disney park attractions such as the ''[[Fantasmic!]]'' show debuted in 1992 at Disneyland Park, as one of the [[Disney Villains]] summoned to destroy [[Mickey Mouse]]. A massive Ursula [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] appears in [[The Little Mermaid ~ Ariel's Undersea Adventure]], a dark ride at [[Disney California Adventure]], and [[Magic Kingdom]]. Ursula is a central character in the annual [[Halloween]]-themed [[fireworks]] show [[HalloWishes]] at the [[Walt Disney World]] [[Magic Kingdom]] ''[[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]]'' \"hard ticket\" event. Ursula also appears at the tail end of the ''Little Mermaid'' unit in [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]] at [[Disneyland]].\n\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' video game, Ursula appears as one of [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]'s co-conspirators, using the power of the [[Heartless (Kingdom Hearts)|Heartless]] to attack Atlantica and gain power. In this version of events, the official walkthrough states that Ursula was King Triton's fortuneteller before she was banished. Ursula is eventually defeated by [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], Ariel, [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]]. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', she appears as a [[facsimile]] created from Sora's memories. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Ursula mysteriously returns through the powers of darkness and appears to Ariel, and recreates her film role. As the film's storyline is retold in the game, Ursula does not recognize Sora and company, and Ariel makes no mention of her defeat in the original ''Kingdom Hearts''. In fact, when Ursula arrives to make the deal with Ariel, the latter reacts as though she has seen Ursula for the first time. Sora, however, does note that Ursula \"got what she deserved\" in the first game. At the story's climax, she is defeated when Eric hurls the trident straight through Ursula's chest, destroying her seemingly once and for all. However, she reappears in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', confronting Sora and Riku out at sea in her giant form from the end of the movie. The game gives conflicting hints on whether or not this Ursula is the \"real one,\" and serves a very small role, providing the tutorial to the game's battle system and delivering a line that foreshadows the plot of the game's main antagonist, Xehanort.\n\nShe has appeared for the concept art from [[Epic Mickey]] in 2010. When Ursula tries to kidnap Gremlin Gus, Mickey comes to the rescue and saved him from trying to let go of her clutches.\n\nUrsula appeared occasionally in the animated television series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' (2001) as one of Mickey's guests at the night club. In the feature film ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' she participated in the musical number \"It's Our House Now\" alongside other Disney villains, and is one of Jafar's henchmen.<ref>{{cite AV media|people =Jamie Mitchell|title =Mickey's House of Villains|medium =Television production|publisher =Walt Disney Television Animation|location =USA|date = 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Rebel Wilson]] performed the role of Ursula at a stripped-down concert version of ''The Little Mermaid'' at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], which featured the songs from the film and four songs from the Broadway musical.<ref>{{ cite web | first=Jenelle | last=Riley | date=2016-06-04 | title=L.A.

In this novel, Ursula is King Triton's younger sister who was betrayed by him as a child for choosing a tentacled form instead of a mermaid's tail, and grew up as a human in the town of Ipswich with an adoptive human father. Ursula returned to the sea when her adopted father was killed by the townsfolk for protecting her, befriending Athena, Queen of Atlantica, but was denied her inheritance by Triton and banished to the shadows. Ursula conspires with three other witches to steal Triton's soul and become ruler of all the seas, but is ultimately defeated.<ref>{{ cite book | first=Serena | last=Valentino | date=2016 | title=Poor Unfortunate Soul | publisher=Disney Press | ISBN=9781484724057 }}</ref>\n\n===Broadway musical===\n{{main|The Little Mermaid (musical)}}\nIn the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|musical version]] of the original film, [[Sherie Rene Scott]] originated the live role, which she played until January 25, 2009.

Bonus material from ''The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition'' DVD. Walt Disney Home Entertainment.</ref> When Ursula and Triton's father died, the pair were given equal share of the sea plus two magical items: Triton received the trident while Ursula received the magic Nautilus shell. Though the two were meant to rule the seas together, Ursula's greed and use of dark magic to usurp Triton led to her being banished. The desire for revenge and power is her motivation for the show. The musical's plot is similar to the film, with the exceptions that Ursula doesn't transform into Vanessa, and Ursula is ultimately defeated by Ariel, when the mermaid destroys the Nautilus shell that contains Ursula's power. In the revamped version of the musical developed by Glenn Casale in 2012, Ursula and Triton's backstory was changed, making them the seventh and eighth of eight siblings respectively. Ursula killed their older siblings one by one until she became a queen, and she forgot about Triton until he became old enough to depose her and become king. Ursula's motivation for revenge otherwise remains similar to the original book of the musical, with the addition that she was the one who killed Ariel's mother.\n\nIn addition to her song from the film, [[Alan Menken]] and [[Glenn Slater]] wrote new songs for Ursula: \"I Want the Good Times Back\", which introduces Ursula and her backstory, \"I Want the Good Times Back (reprise)\", where Ursula orders Flotsam and Jetsam to sabotage Ariel's attempt to get Eric to kiss her, and a reprise of \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", where Ursula forces Triton to sign a deal and claims the trident.

In the episode \"[[Ariel (Once Upon a Time)|Ariel]]\", Ursula is described as a sea goddess whom no one has seen for a thousand years. According to Ariel, Ursula gave merfolk the ability to gain legs once a year, when the tide is highest. Ariel uses this ability to visit Prince Eric at his castle, where he is having a ball honoring Ursula. Later, the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]] ([[Lana Parrilla]]) disguises herself as Ursula in order to make a deal with Ariel and trick her into capturing Snow White. This physical disguise includes short white hair and tentacles, similar to Ursula's animated appearance. Although the Queen considers Ursula to be \"a long-dead octopus\", she is shocked when the real Ursula possesses a statue and warns the queen not to impersonate her again.\n\n;The Sea Witch\nUrsula the Sea Witch is an antagonist who appears in the second half of Season 4, where she is portrayed as an adult by [[Merrin Dungey]], and as a teenager by [[Tiffany Boone]].\n\nThe episode \"[[Poor Unfortunate Soul (Once Upon a Time)|Poor Unfortunate Soul]]\" contains further flashbacks to Ursula's youth, when she was a teenage [[mermaid]] living under the sea with her father King [[Poseidon]] ([[Ernie Hudson]]). Ursula was gifted with a beautiful voice, which Poseidon wanted her to use to lure pirates to their death, in order to avenge the murder of Ursula's mother at the hands of an unnamed pirate. Ursula refused and instead befriended a pirate, Captain Hook ([[Colin O'Donoghue]]), who supported her desire for freedom. Ursula and Hook's friendship fell apart when Hook sealed Ursula's singing voice inside an enchanted shell, in order to punish Poseidon for destroying a weapon Hook wanted for himself. Ursula, angered and disappointed with both merfolk and humans, used Poseidon's trident to transform her tail into tentacles, emulating the ancient sea goddess that she was named after.\n\nThe episodes \"[[Heroes and Villains (Once Upon a Time)|Heroes and Villains]]\" and \"[[Darkness on the Edge of Town (Once Upon a Time)|Darkness on the Edge of Town]]\" contain flashbacks to the Enchanted Forest past, where Ursula teamed up with fellow witches [[Maleficent#Once Upon a Time|Maleficent]] ([[Kristin Bauer van Straten]]) and [[Cruella de Vil#Once Upon a Time|Cruella De Vil]] ([[Victoria Smurfit]]). The three of them worked together to try to defeat the heroes and find their happy endings, but failed. In the episode \"[[Best Laid Plans (Once Upon a Time)|Best Laid Plans]]\", while trying to rescue Maleficent's baby from Snow and Charming, Ursula and Cruella fell into a portal that lead into the non-magical world. Three decades later, in modern day New York, Ursula is working as a cleaner in an aquarium when she is recruited by Rumplestiltskin, who also reunites her with Cruella. Ursula, Cruella and Rumplestiltskin then trick their way into entering the magical town of Storybrooke. In the episode \"[[Unforgiven (Once Upon a Time)|Unforgiven]]\", they resurrect Maleficent to join their group.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Best Laid Plans (Once Upon a Time)|Best Laid Plans]]\" flashback it was shown that she and Cruella were sent from Enchanted Forrest before Dark Curse to World Without Magic because of [[Snow White]] ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) and [[Prince Charming]] ([[Josh Dallas]]). \n\nIn the episode's \"Poor Unfortunate Soul\" present time, a remorseful Hook makes a deal with Ursula to get her singing voice back. They are only successful when Ariel intercedes, bringing Poseidon to Storybrooke so that he and Ursula can reconcile, and the enchantment is broken. Having achieved her happy ending, Ursula then tells Hook the full plan Rumplestiltskin has for the heroes, and afterward returns to the sea with her father.\n\n===''Descendants 2''===\n{{Main|Descendants 2}}\n\nUrsula makes an appearance in the movie, voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. In the film, her daughter Uma is the main antagonist. During one scene, Ursula whips her tentacle out from the kitchen of her Fish and Chips shop and yells at Uma to stop singing and come to wash the dishes.\n\nTwenty years prior to the movie, Ursula had been banished on the Isle of the Lost with other villains. It's also revealed that Ursula and Maleficent had a rivalry over who gets to be the ruler of the island. Now, she has a daughter named Uma, who is feisty and manipulative just like her mom and she works at her mother's fish and chips shop. Uma and her archenemy, Mal, who is Maleficent's daughter, have a heated rivalry on the island.

Voiced by American actress [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]], Ursula is a villainous [[sea witch]] who offers a [[mermaid]] princess named [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]] in exchange to trade her voice for a pair of human legs, at first appearing to be providing the character with an opportunity to become human by temporarily transforming her into one so that she may earn the love of [[List of Disney's The Little Mermaid characters|Prince Eric]] within three days. However, Ursula is, in fact, determined to sabotage Ariel's chances so that she can ultimately replace [[King Triton (The Little Mermaid)|King Triton]] as ruler over Atlantica.\n\nCreated by directors and screenwriters [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]], Ursula is based on the sea witch character who appears in the fairy tale \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. However, her minor role was greatly expanded into that of a much more prominent villain for the film. Disney had struggled to cast Ursula for a year, during which the role was well sought after by several coveted television actresses at the time. Clements and Musker disagreed with lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] about who should voice the character. While the directors had written the role with [[Bea Arthur]] in mind, Ashman intended to offer it to [[soap opera]] star [[Joan Collins]]; both actresses rejected the part. When Ashman cast his second choice, Broadway actress [[Elaine Stritch]], as Ursula, both stage veterans disagreed about the manner in which Ursula's song \"[[Poor Unfortunate Souls]]\" would be performed, and [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] was finally hired to replace Stritch after Ashman fired her. Deepening her own voice for the role, Carroll based her performance on a combination of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actresses and [[Car salesman|car salespeople]].\n\nAnimated by [[Ruben A. Aquino]], Ursula's original design was inspired by several different [[Marine biology|sea creatures]], including [[manta ray]]s and [[Scorpaeniformes|scorpion fish]], before Clements finally decided to base the character on an [[octopus]]; her number of [[tentacle]]s was reduced from eight to six for financial reasons. Ursula's appearance was also inspired by American actor and drag queen [[Divine (performer)|Divine]]. When ''The Little Mermaid'' was first released in 1989, Ursula was immediately embraced as one of Disney's best villains, and continues to be ranked highly among the studio's greatest by the media. Praised for being humorous and frightening, the character has garnered positive reviews from film critics, some of whom dubbed her Disney's strongest villain in decades. Meanwhile, Carroll's performance has garnered similar acclaim to the point that the role has eclipsed her previous body of work, ultimately becoming virtually synonymous with the character.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Conception and writing===\nAt the behest of Disney executives [[Michael Eisner]] and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], director and screenwriter [[Ron Clements]] was among several filmmakers instructed to research new story ideas that could potentially be adapted into the studio's next major animated film release.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/moviemom/2013/09/interview-ron-clements-john-musker-little-mermaid-disney.html|title=Interview: Ron Clements and John Musker of \"The Little Mermaid\"|last=Minow|first=Nell|date=|website=Beliefnet|publisher=Beliefnet, Inc|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> Clements first discovered [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s classic fairy tale \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" at a local bookstore, and began deliberating why Disney had never attempted to adapt the story before.<ref name=\":2\" /> Clements eventually learned that [[Walt Disney]] himself had actually attempted to adapt the fairy tale into a feature-length animated film as early as the 1930s,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moviefone.com/2014/11/14/the-little-mermaid-facts/|title='The Little Mermaid' Facts: 25 Things You Didn't Know About the Disney Masterpiece|last=Susman|first=Gary|date=November 14, 2014|website=Moviefone|publisher=Aol Inc|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> but the project was ultimately shelved due in part to its sad ending.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/03/15/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-little-mermaid-5104832/|title=10 things you probably didn\u2019t know about The Little Mermaid|last=Duncan|first=Amy|date=March 15, 2010|website=Metro|publisher=|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> Clements suggested \"The Little Mermaid\" to Katzenberg, who finally [[Green-light|green-lit]] it after having first rejected it.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHardly present in Andersen's original story,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emgn.com/entertainment/15-exciting-facts-about-the-little-mermaid-you-never-knew/|title=15 Exciting Facts About The Little Mermaid You Never Knew!|last=|first=|date=|website=EMGN|publisher=|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> the [[sea witch]] is not a prominent character and lacks a [[proper name]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2014/08/16/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-little-mermaid/|title=15 THINGS YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MERMAID|last=Brandon|first=Emily|date=2014|website=Oh My Disney|publisher=Disney|access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> Among Clements' ideas to alter the story, the filmmaker decided to \"make the witch more of a villain\", describing Ursula as \"a fun character to develop\" into such.<ref name=\":2\" /> In Andersen's tale, the sea witch is not a villain as much as she is \"a disreputable mermaid.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disneyvillains.net/Ursula.php|title=Ursula \u2013 The Little Mermaid (1989)|last=|first=|date=|website=Disney Villains|publisher=Disney Villains|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> JR Thorpe of ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' agreed that, in Andersen's story, \"The sea witch isn't the enemy\".

When Ariel saves and falls in love with a human named Prince Eric much to her father's chagrin, Ursula temporarily grants Ariel's wish to live as a human for three days in return for her voice. If she successfully earns a kiss from Eric by the end of the third day, Ariel will remain human permanently; if she fails, she will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula forever. However, Ursula is determined to sabotage Ariel's and Eric's budding romance at any cost; when she realizes that Ariel and Eric are falling in love, Ursula transforms herself into a beautiful young woman named \"Vanessa\" and hypnotizes Eric, tricking him into agreeing to marry her instead. Ariel manages to thwart Ursula and Eric's wedding. Eric realizes that it was Ariel who saved him when her voice returns to her and is about to kiss her, but as the sun sets Ariel transforms back into a mermaid and is captured by Ursula. Triton confronts Ursula and agrees to give up himself and his magical trident in return for Ariel's freedom. Ursula then uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions and attempts to kill Ariel and Eric, but Eric manages to impale Ursula with the splintered bowsprit of a wrecked ship, and she dies. With Ursula defeated, her power's cease, the merpeople turn back to normal, Triton's power is restored, and Ariel marries Eric once she is permanently transformed into a human.\n\n===Television series===\n{{main|The Little Mermaid (TV series)}}\nUrsula appears as the antagonist in four episodes of ''[[The Little Mermaid (TV series)|The Little Mermaid]]'' prequel television series: \"Against the Tide\", \"Tail of Two Crabs\", \"Heroes\" and \"Ariel's Treasures\". In all four episodes, she executes various plans to antagonize King Triton and take over Atlantica, but all fail.  \n\n===''The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea''===\n{{Main|The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea}}\n\nUrsula does not appear in the direct-to-video film ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' because she is killed in the first film, but she is mentioned many times, mostly by her younger sister [[Morgana (The Little Mermaid)|Morgana]], also voiced by Pat Carroll. In the family portrait during the cut song \"Gonna Get My Wish\", Ursula was also depicted with light green skin similar to Morgana and their mother.\n\n==In other media==\nUrsula appears in Disney park attractions such as the ''[[Fantasmic!]]'' show debuted in 1992 at Disneyland Park, as one of the [[Disney Villains]] summoned to destroy [[Mickey Mouse]]. A massive Ursula [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] appears in [[The Little Mermaid ~ Ariel's Undersea Adventure]], a dark ride at [[Disney California Adventure]], and [[Magic Kingdom]]. Ursula is a central character in the annual [[Halloween]]-themed [[fireworks]] show [[HalloWishes]] at the [[Walt Disney World]] [[Magic Kingdom]] ''[[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]]'' \"hard ticket\" event. Ursula also appears at the tail end of the ''Little Mermaid'' unit in [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]] at [[Disneyland]].\n\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' video game, Ursula appears as one of [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]'s co-conspirators, using the power of the [[Heartless (Kingdom Hearts)|Heartless]] to attack Atlantica and gain power. In this version of events, the official walkthrough states that Ursula was King Triton's fortuneteller before she was banished. Ursula is eventually defeated by [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], Ariel, [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]]. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', she appears as a [[facsimile]] created from Sora's memories. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Ursula mysteriously returns through the powers of darkness and appears to Ariel, and recreates her film role. As the film's storyline is retold in the game, Ursula does not recognize Sora and company, and Ariel makes no mention of her defeat in the original ''Kingdom Hearts''. In fact, when Ursula arrives to make the deal with Ariel, the latter reacts as though she has seen Ursula for the first time. Sora, however, does note that Ursula \"got what she deserved\" in the first game. At the story's climax, she is defeated when Eric hurls the trident straight through Ursula's chest, destroying her seemingly once and for all. However, she reappears in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', confronting Sora and Riku out at sea in her giant form from the end of the movie. The game gives conflicting hints on whether or not this Ursula is the \"real one,\" and serves a very small role, providing the tutorial to the game's battle system and delivering a line that foreshadows the plot of the game's main antagonist, Xehanort.\n\nShe has appeared for the concept art from [[Epic Mickey]] in 2010. When Ursula tries to kidnap Gremlin Gus, Mickey comes to the rescue and saved him from trying to let go of her clutches.\n\nUrsula appeared occasionally in the animated television series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' (2001) as one of Mickey's guests at the night club. In the feature film ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]'' she participated in the musical number \"It's Our House Now\" alongside other Disney villains, and is one of Jafar's henchmen.<ref>{{cite AV media|people =Jamie Mitchell|title =Mickey's House of Villains|medium =Television production|publisher =Walt Disney Television Animation|location =USA|date = 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Rebel Wilson]] performed the role of Ursula at a stripped-down concert version of ''The Little Mermaid'' at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], which featured the songs from the film and four songs from the Broadway musical.<ref>{{ cite web | first=Jenelle | last=Riley | date=2016-06-04 | title=L.A.

In this novel, Ursula is King Triton's younger sister who was betrayed by him as a child for choosing a tentacled form instead of a mermaid's tail, and grew up as a human in the town of Ipswich with an adoptive human father. Ursula returned to the sea when her adopted father was killed by the townsfolk for protecting her, befriending Athena, Queen of Atlantica, but was denied her inheritance by Triton and banished to the shadows. Ursula conspires with three other witches to steal Triton's soul and become ruler of all the seas, but is ultimately defeated.<ref>{{ cite book | first=Serena | last=Valentino | date=2016 | title=Poor Unfortunate Soul | publisher=Disney Press | ISBN=9781484724057 }}</ref>\n\n===Broadway musical===\n{{main|The Little Mermaid (musical)}}\nIn the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|musical version]] of the original film, [[Sherie Rene Scott]] originated the live role, which she played until January 25, 2009.

Bonus material from ''The Little Mermaid: Platinum Edition'' DVD. Walt Disney Home Entertainment.</ref> When Ursula and Triton's father died, the pair were given equal share of the sea plus two magical items: Triton received the trident while Ursula received the magic Nautilus shell. Though the two were meant to rule the seas together, Ursula's greed and use of dark magic to usurp Triton led to her being banished. The desire for revenge and power is her motivation for the show. The musical's plot is similar to the film, with the exceptions that Ursula doesn't transform into Vanessa, and Ursula is ultimately defeated by Ariel, when the mermaid destroys the Nautilus shell that contains Ursula's power. In the revamped version of the musical developed by Glenn Casale in 2012, Ursula and Triton's backstory was changed, making them the seventh and eighth of eight siblings respectively. Ursula killed their older siblings one by one until she became a queen, and she forgot about Triton until he became old enough to depose her and become king. Ursula's motivation for revenge otherwise remains similar to the original book of the musical, with the addition that she was the one who killed Ariel's mother.\n\nIn addition to her song from the film, [[Alan Menken]] and [[Glenn Slater]] wrote new songs for Ursula: \"I Want the Good Times Back\", which introduces Ursula and her backstory, \"I Want the Good Times Back (reprise)\", where Ursula orders Flotsam and Jetsam to sabotage Ariel's attempt to get Eric to kiss her, and a reprise of \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", where Ursula forces Triton to sign a deal and claims the trident.

In the episode \"[[Ariel (Once Upon a Time)|Ariel]]\", Ursula is described as a sea goddess whom no one has seen for a thousand years. According to Ariel, Ursula gave merfolk the ability to gain legs once a year, when the tide is highest. Ariel uses this ability to visit Prince Eric at his castle, where he is having a ball honoring Ursula. Later, the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]] ([[Lana Parrilla]]) disguises herself as Ursula in order to make a deal with Ariel and trick her into capturing Snow White. This physical disguise includes short white hair and tentacles, similar to Ursula's animated appearance. Although the Queen considers Ursula to be \"a long-dead octopus\", she is shocked when the real Ursula possesses a statue and warns the queen not to impersonate her again.\n\n;The Sea Witch\nUrsula the Sea Witch is an antagonist who appears in the second half of Season 4, where she is portrayed as an adult by [[Merrin Dungey]], and as a teenager by [[Tiffany Boone]].\n\nThe episode \"[[Poor Unfortunate Soul (Once Upon a Time)|Poor Unfortunate Soul]]\" contains further flashbacks to Ursula's youth, when she was a teenage [[mermaid]] living under the sea with her father King [[Poseidon]] ([[Ernie Hudson]]). Ursula was gifted with a beautiful voice, which Poseidon wanted her to use to lure pirates to their death, in order to avenge the murder of Ursula's mother at the hands of an unnamed pirate. Ursula refused and instead befriended a pirate, Captain Hook ([[Colin O'Donoghue]]), who supported her desire for freedom. Ursula and Hook's friendship fell apart when Hook sealed Ursula's singing voice inside an enchanted shell, in order to punish Poseidon for destroying a weapon Hook wanted for himself. Ursula, angered and disappointed with both merfolk and humans, used Poseidon's trident to transform her tail into tentacles, emulating the ancient sea goddess that she was named after.\n\nThe episodes \"[[Heroes and Villains (Once Upon a Time)|Heroes and Villains]]\" and \"[[Darkness on the Edge of Town (Once Upon a Time)|Darkness on the Edge of Town]]\" contain flashbacks to the Enchanted Forest past, where Ursula teamed up with fellow witches [[Maleficent#Once Upon a Time|Maleficent]] ([[Kristin Bauer van Straten]]) and [[Cruella de Vil#Once Upon a Time|Cruella De Vil]] ([[Victoria Smurfit]]). The three of them worked together to try to defeat the heroes and find their happy endings, but failed. In the episode \"[[Best Laid Plans (Once Upon a Time)|Best Laid Plans]]\", while trying to rescue Maleficent's baby from Snow and Charming, Ursula and Cruella fell into a portal that lead into the non-magical world. Three decades later, in modern day New York, Ursula is working as a cleaner in an aquarium when she is recruited by Rumplestiltskin, who also reunites her with Cruella. Ursula, Cruella and Rumplestiltskin then trick their way into entering the magical town of Storybrooke. In the episode \"[[Unforgiven (Once Upon a Time)|Unforgiven]]\", they resurrect Maleficent to join their group.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Best Laid Plans (Once Upon a Time)|Best Laid Plans]]\" flashback it was shown that she and Cruella were sent from Enchanted Forrest before Dark Curse to World Without Magic because of [[Snow White]] ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) and [[Prince Charming]] ([[Josh Dallas]]). \n\nIn the episode's \"Poor Unfortunate Soul\" present time, a remorseful Hook makes a deal with Ursula to get her singing voice back. They are only successful when Ariel intercedes, bringing Poseidon to Storybrooke so that he and Ursula can reconcile, and the enchantment is broken. Having achieved her happy ending, Ursula then tells Hook the full plan Rumplestiltskin has for the heroes, and afterward returns to the sea with her father.\n\n===''Descendants 2''===\n{{Main|Descendants 2}}\n\nUrsula makes an appearance in the movie, voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. In the film, her daughter Uma is the main antagonist. During one scene, Ursula whips her tentacle out from the kitchen of her Fish and Chips shop and yells at Uma to stop singing and come to wash the dishes.\n\nTwenty years prior to the movie, Ursula had been banished on the Isle of the Lost with other villains. It's also revealed that Ursula and Maleficent had a rivalry over who gets to be the ruler of the island. Now, she has a daughter named Uma, who is feisty and manipulative just like her mom and she works at her mother's fish and chips shop. Uma and her archenemy, Mal, who is Maleficent's daughter, have a heated rivalry on the island.

They are created during [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] in a process known as [[myogenesis]].\n\nMyofibrils are composed of long proteins including [[actin]], [[myosin]], and [[titin]], and other proteins that hold them together. These proteins are organized into thick and thin filaments called [[myofilament]]s, which repeat along the length of the myofibril in sections called [[sarcomere]]s. [[Muscle contraction|Muscles contract]] by [[sliding filament theory|sliding the thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments]] along each other. This is by sumit kumar sah.\n\n==Structure==\nThe filaments of myofibrils, [[myofilament]]s, consist of two types, thick and thin:\n*Thin filaments consist primarily of the protein [[actin]], coiled with [[nebulin]] filaments. Actin, when polymerized into filaments, forms the \"ladder\" along which the myosin filaments \"climb\" to generate motion\n*Thick filaments consist primarily of the protein [[myosin]], held in place by [[titin]] filaments. Myosin is responsible for force generation. It is composed of a globular head with both ATP and actin binding sites, and a long tail involved in its polymerization into myosin filaments.\n\nThe protein complex composed of actin and myosin is sometimes referred to as \"actinomyosin\".\n\nIn striated muscle, such as [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[cardiac muscle]], the actin and myosin filaments each have a specific and constant length on the order of a few micrometers, far less than the length of the elongated muscle cell (a few millimeters in the case of human skeletal muscle cells). The filaments are organized into repeated subunits along the length of the myofibril. These subunits are called [[sarcomere]]s. The muscle cell is nearly filled with myofibrils running parallel to each other on the long axis of the cell. The sarcomeric subunits of one myofibril are in nearly perfect alignment with those of the myofibrils next to it. This alignment gives rise to certain optical properties which cause the cell to appear striped or striated. In [[smooth muscle]] cells, this alignment is absent, hence there are no apparent striations and the cells are called smooth.<ref>[http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/fibril.shtml Muscle Physiology \u2013 Myofilament Structure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Exposed muscle cells at certain angles, such as in [[cuts of meat|meat cuts]], can show [[structural coloration]] or [[iridescence]] due to this periodic alignment of the fibrils and sarcomeres.<ref name=foods>{{cite journal | journal=Foods | title=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | date=November 2013 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J L | volume=2 | pages=499\u2013506 |doi=10.3390/foods2040499 | pmid=28239133 | issue=4| last2=Akram | first2=Muhammad | last3=Yetisen | first3=Ali | pmc=5302279 }}</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\n[[Image:sarcomere.gif|thumb|left|450px]]\n\nThe names of the various sub-regions of the sarcomere are based on their relatively lighter or darker appearance when viewed through the light microscope.  Each sarcomere is delimited by two very dark colored bands called Z-discs or Z-lines (from the German ''zwischen'' meaning between). These Z-discs are dense protein discs that do not easily allow the passage of light. The [[T-tubule]] is present in this area.  The area between the Z-discs is further divided into two lighter colored bands at either end called the I-bands, and a darker, grayish band in the middle called the A band.\n\nThe I bands appear lighter because these regions of the sarcomere mainly contain the thin actin filaments, whose smaller diameter allows the passage of light between them. The A band, on the other hand, contains mostly [[myosin]] filaments whose larger diameter restricts the passage of light. A stands for [[anisotropic]] and I for [[isotropic]], referring to the optical properties of living muscle as demonstrated with [[polarized light]] microscopy.\n\nThe parts of the A band that abut the I bands are occupied by the both actin and myosin filaments (where they interdigitate as described above). Also within the A band is a relatively brighter central region called the H-zone (from the German ''helle'', meaning bright) in which there is no actin/myosin overlap when the muscle is in a relaxed state.  Finally, the H-zone is bisected by a dark central line called the M-line (from the German ''mittel'' meaning middle).\n\n==Development==\nA study of the developing leg muscle in a 12-day chick embryo using electron microscopy proposes a mechanism for the development of myofibrils. Developing muscle cells contain thick (myosin) filaments that are 160\u2013170 [[Angstrom|\u00c5]] in diameter and thin (actin)filaments that are 60\u201370 \u00c5 in diameter. Young myofibers contain a 7:1 ratio of thin to thick filaments. Along the long axis of the muscle cells in subsarcolemmal locations, free myofilaments become aligned and aggregate into hexagonally packed arrays. These aggregates form regardless of the presence of Z band or M band material. Aggregation occurs spontaneously because the tertiary structures of actin and myosin monomers contain all the \"information\" with the ionic strength and ATP concentration of the cell to aggregate into the filaments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fischman, Donald A. |title=An electron microscope study of myofibril formation in embryonic chick skeletal muscle|journal= The Journal of Cell Biology|volume= 32|issue=3|year=1967|pages= 558\u201375|doi=10.1083/jcb.32.3.557|pmc=2107275|pmid=6034479}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nThe [[myosin]] heads form cross bridges with the [[actin]] myofilaments; this is where they carry out a 'rowing' action along the actin. When the muscle fibre is relaxed (before contraction), the myosin head has ADP and phosphate bound to it.\n\nWhen a nerve impulse arrives, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions cause [[troponin]] to change shape; this moves the troponin + tropomyosin complex away, leaving the myosin binding sites open.\n\nThe myosin head now binds to the actin myofilament.  Energy in the head of the myosin myofilament moves the head, which slides the actin past.  hence ADP is released.\n\nATP presents itself (as the presence of the calcium ions activates the myosin's ATPase), and the myosin heads disconnect from the actin to grab the ATP. The ATP is then broken down into ADP and phosphate. Energy is released and stored in the myosin head to utilize for later movement.  The myosin heads now return to their upright relaxed position.  If calcium is present, the process is repeated.\n\nWhen a muscle contracts, the actin is pulled along myosin toward the center of the [[sarcomere]] until the actin and myosin filaments are completely overlapped.  The H zone becomes smaller and smaller due to the increasing overlap of actin and myosin filaments, and the muscle shortens.  Thus when the muscle is fully contracted, the H zone is no longer visible.  Note that the actin and myosin filaments themselves do not change length, but instead slide past each other.  This is known as the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction.<ref>Marieb, E. N., Hoehn, K., & Hoehn, F. (2007). Human Anatomy & Physiology. (7th ed., pp. 284\u201387).

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\nThere are several similar [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]]. The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as [[Glossary of leaf morphology|leaf shape]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] length and nut size. For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the [[Castanea ozarkensis|Ozark chinkapin]], which is typically considered either a distinct species (''C. ozarkensis'') or a subspecies of the [[Castanea pumila|Allegheny chinkapin]] (''C. pumila ozarkensis'') may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Hongwen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Leigh K.|last3=Dane|first3=Fenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Genetic Variation and Population Structure of Castanea pumila var. ozarkensis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en-US|volume=124|issue=6|pages=666\u2013670|doi=10.21273/JASHS.124.6.666|issn=2327-9788|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/saving-chestnut-trees-ozarks/|title=A legendary Ozark chestnut tree, thought extinct, is rediscovered|date=2019-06-24|website=Environment|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The [[Plant disease resistance|blight-resistant]] Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Variations|monoecious]], producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long [[catkin]]s. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family [[Fagaceae]], American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

This disease was accidentally introduced into North America on imported Asiatic chestnut trees. [[Chestnut blight]] was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the [[Bronx Zoo]], in the borough of [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], in 1904, by chief forester [[Hermann Merkel]].

This pathogen, apparently introduced from Europe, where it affects ''C. sativa'', kills the tree's roots and collars. It affected primarily chestnuts in the Southeastern US and at the time when chestnut blight struck, the range of ''C. dentata'' may have already been reduced.\n\n===Reduced population===\nThe total number of chestnut trees in eastern North America was estimated at over three billion, and 25% of the trees in the Appalachian Mountains were American chestnut. The number of large surviving trees over {{convert|60|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter within its former range is probably fewer than 100.

American chestnut also thrives as far north as [[Revelstoke, British Columbia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt present, it is believed that survival of ''C. dentata'' for more than a decade in its native range is almost impossible.

The [[American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation]] breeds surviving American chestnuts, which have shown some native resistance to blight, and the Canadian Chestnut Council is attempting to reintroduce the trees in Canada, primarily in [[Ontario]]. A technique called [[backcrossing]] is being used by [[The American Chestnut Foundation]] in an attempt to restore the American chestnut to its original habitat.\n\n===Intercrossing surviving American chestnuts===\n[[File:Floyda.jpg|thumb|upright|Large surviving blight-resistant American chestnut in its natural range. Surviving trees passing resistance tests are utilized in ACCF's All American Breeding program.]]\n[[American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation]] (ACCF) is not using Oriental genes for blight resistance, but [[Hybrid (biology)|intercrossing]] among American chestnuts selected for native resistance to the blight, a breeding strategy described by the ACCF as \"All-American intercrosses\". John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and [[professor emeritus]] of chemistry at [[Concord University]], and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at [[Virginia Tech]], think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut.<ref name=griffin>[http://www.accf-online.org/biblio.html \"Bibliography.\"] ''www.accf-online.org.'' Retrieved January 11, 2016.</ref>  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\nThere are several similar [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]]. The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as [[Glossary of leaf morphology|leaf shape]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] length and nut size. For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the [[Castanea ozarkensis|Ozark chinkapin]], which is typically considered either a distinct species (''C. ozarkensis'') or a subspecies of the [[Castanea pumila|Allegheny chinkapin]] (''C. pumila ozarkensis'') may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Hongwen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Leigh K.|last3=Dane|first3=Fenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Genetic Variation and Population Structure of Castanea pumila var. ozarkensis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en-US|volume=124|issue=6|pages=666\u2013670|doi=10.21273/JASHS.124.6.666|issn=2327-9788|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/saving-chestnut-trees-ozarks/|title=A legendary Ozark chestnut tree, thought extinct, is rediscovered|date=2019-06-24|website=Environment|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The [[Plant disease resistance|blight-resistant]] Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Variations|monoecious]], producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long [[catkin]]s. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family [[Fagaceae]], American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.
