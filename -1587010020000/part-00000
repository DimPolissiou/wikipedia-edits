According to Chen Xiaoyi {{lang|zh|\u9673\u66c9\u6bc5}} local indigenous religion is the crucial factor for a harmonious \"religious ecology\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b97\u6559\u751f\u614b}}), that is the balance of forces in a given community.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=405}} Professor Han Bingfang {{lang|zh|\u97d3\u79c9\u82b3}} has called for a [[rectification of names|rectification of distorted names]] ({{lang|zh|\u6b63\u540d}}). Distorted names are \"superstitious activities\" ({{lang|zh|\u8ff7\u4fe1\u6d3b\u52d5}}) or \"feudal superstition\" ({{lang|zh|\u5c01\u5efa\u8ff7\u4fe1}}), that were derogatorily applied to the indigenous religion by leftist policies. Christian missionaries also used the propaganda label \"feudal superstition\" in order to undermine their religious competitor.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408}} Han calls for the acknowledgment of the ancient Chinese religion for what it really is, the \"core and soul of popular culture\" ({{lang|zh|\u4fd7\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8207\u9748\u9b42}}).{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=407}}\n\nAccording to Chen Jinguo {{lang|zh|\u9673\u9032\u570b}}, the ancient Chinese religion is a core element of Chinese cultural and religious self-awareness ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u5316\u81ea\u89ba, \u4fe1\u4ef0\u81ea\u89ba}}).{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408}} He has proposed a theoretical definition of Chinese indigenous religion in \"three inseparable attributes\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u9ad4}}), apparently inspired to [[Tang Junyi]]'s thought:{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408-409}}\n* substance (''t\u01d0'' {{lang|zh|\u9ad4}}): religiousness (''z\u014dngji\u00e0o x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u5b97\u6559\u6027}});\n* function (''y\u00f2ng'' {{lang|zh|\u7528}}): folkloricity (''m\u00edns\u00fa x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u6c11\u4fd7\u6027}});\n* quality (''xi\u00e0ng'' {{lang|zh|\u76f8}}): Chineseness (''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6027}}).\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See also|Chinese creation myth|Chinese spiritual world concepts}}\n[[File:Worship at the Great Temple of Shennong-Yandi in Suizhou, Hubei.jpg|thumb|Communal ceremony at the Great Temple of [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] [[Shennong]] ({{lang|zh|\u708e\u5e1d\u795e\u8fb2\u5927\u6bbf}} ''Y\u00e1nd\u00ec Sh\u00e9nn\u00f3ng d\u00e0di\u00e0n'') in [[Suizhou]], [[Hubei]].]]\n[[File:\u5abd\u7956\u5a18\u5a18002.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] at a temple in [[Chiayi City|Chiayi]], [[Taiwan]].]]\n\n===Diversity and unity===\n\nAncient Chinese religious practices are diverse, varying from province to province and even from one village to another, for religious behaviour is bound to local communities, kinship, and environments. In each setting, institution and ritual behaviour assumes highly organised forms. Temples and the gods in them acquire symbolic character and perform specific functions involved in the everyday life of the local community.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5</ref> Local religion preserves aspects of natural beliefs such as [[Totem|totemism]],<ref name=\"Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61\">Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61</ref> [[animism]], and [[shamanism]].<ref>Fenggang Yang, ''Social Scientific Studies of Religion in China: Methodologies, Theories, and Findings ''. BRILL, 2011. {{ISBN|9004182462}}. p. 112</ref>\n\nAncient Chinese religion pervades all aspects of social life. Many scholars, following the lead of sociologist [[C. K. Yang (sociologist)|C. K. Yang]], see the ancient Chinese religion deeply embedded in family and civic life, rather than expressed in a separate organisational structure like a \"church,\" as in the West.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4.</ref>\n\nDeity or temple associations and [[Chinese lineage associations|lineage associations]], pilgrimage associations and formalised prayers, rituals and expressions of virtues, are the common forms of organisation of Chinese religion on the local level.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\"/> Neither initiation rituals nor official membership into a church organisation separate from one person's native identity are mandatory in order to be involved in religious activities.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\"/> Contrary to institutional religions, Chinese religion does not require \"conversion\" for participation.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4\"/>\n\nThe prime criterion for participation in the ancient Chinese religion is not \"to believe\" in an official doctrine or [[dogma]], but \"to belong\" to the local unit of an ancient Chinese religion, that is the \"association\", the \"village\" or the \"kinship\", with their gods and rituals.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\"/> Scholar Richard Madsen describes the ancient Chinese religion, adopting the definition of [[Tu Weiming]],<ref>Tu Weiming.

India Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 2010. {{ISBN|8121512204}} / 9788121512206</ref> as characterised by \"immanent transcendence\" grounded in a devotion to \"concrete humanity\", focused on building moral community within concrete humanity.<ref name=\"Madsen, 2013\">Madsen, ''Secular belief, religious belonging''. 2013.</ref>\n\nInextricably linked to the aforementioned question to find an appropriate \"name\" for the ancient  Chinese religion, is the difficulty to define it or clearly outline its boundaries. Old [[sinology]], especially Western, tried to distinguish \"popular\" and \"\u00e9lite\" traditions (the latter being Confucianism and Taoism conceived as independent systems). Chinese sinology later adopted another dichotomy which continues in contemporary studies, distinguishing \"folk beliefs\" (''minjian xinyang'') and \"folk religion\" (''minjian zongjiao''), the latter referring to the doctrinal sects.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|p=507}}\n\nMany studies have pointed out that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions, and since the 1970s several sinologists{{who|date=April 2020}} swung to the idea of a unified \"ancient Chinese religion\" that would define the Chinese national identity, similarly to Hinduism for [[India]] and Shinto for [[Japan]]. Other sinologists who have not espoused the idea of a unified \"national religion\" have studied Chinese religion as a system of meaning, or have brought further development in C. K. Yang's distinction between \"institutional religion\" and \"diffused religion\", the former functioning as a separate body from other social institutions, and the latter intimately part of secular social institutions.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|pp=507-508}}\n\n==History==\n=== Imperial China ===\nBy the [[Han dynasty]], the ancient Chinese religion mostly consisted of people organising into ''sh\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u793e}} (\"group\", \"body\", local community altars) who worshipped their godly principle. In many cases the \"lord of the ''she''\" was the god of the earth, and in others a deified virtuous person (''[[xian (Taoism)|xi\u0101n]]'' {{lang|zh|\u4ed9}}, \"immortal\"). Some cults such as that of Liu Zhang, a king in what is today [[Shandong]], date back to this period.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=36-37}}\n\nFrom the 3rd century on by the [[Northern Wei]], accompanying the spread of [[Buddhism]] in China, strong influences from the Indian subcontinent penetrated the ancient Chinese indigenous religion.

Quote: \"[...] southern China refers to Fujian and Guangdong province and in some cases is expanded to include Guangxi, Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period. These areas not only were the first to revive lineage and the territorial cult in the reform era, but also have the intensity and scale of revivals that cannot be matched by the other part of China. This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.\" Note 16: The south-vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen\u2019s article on \"Lineage organization in North China (1990)\" offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model \"the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.\" By which, he means \"patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.\" (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called \"the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.\" In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. \"Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.\" However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China. The set of characteristics of the north model (a distinctive arrangement of cemeteries, graves, ancestral scrolls, ancestral tablets, and corporate groups linked to a characteristic annual ritual cycle) is not a system. In reality, lineage organizations display a mixture between the south and the north model.\"</ref>\n\n===Philosophical and ritual modalities===\n\n====Wuism and shamanic traditions====\n{{Main|Chinese shamanism|Nuo folk religion}}\n[[File:The yard leading to The White Sulde Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Temple of the [[S\u00fclde Tngri|White Sulde]] of [[Genghis Khan]] in the town of [[Uxin Banner|Uxin]] in [[Inner Mongolia]], in the [[Ordos Desert|Mu Us Desert]].

Jones (2007), ''Ritual and Music of North China: Shawm Bands in Shanxi''). He also describes shamans or media known by different names: ''mapi'' {{lang|zh|\u99ac\u88e8}}, ''wupo'' {{lang|zh|\u5deb\u5a46}}, ''shen momo'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b24\u5b24}} or ''shen han'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u6f22}} (p. 87); ''xingdao de'' {{lang|zh|\u9999\u9053\u7684}} (\"practitioners of the incense way\"; p. 85); village ''xiangtou'' {{lang|zh|\u9999\u982d}} (\"incense heads\"; p. 86); ''matong'' {{lang|zh|\u99ac\u7ae5}} (the same as southern ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]''), either ''wushen'' {{lang|zh|\u5deb\u795e}} (possessed by gods) or ''shenguan'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b98}} (possessed by immortals; pp. 88-89); or \"godly sages\" (''shensheng'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u8056}}; p. 91). Further (p. 76), he discusses for example the ''sai'' {{lang|zh|\u8cfd}}, ceremonies of thanksgiving to the gods in [[Shanxi]] with roots in the [[Song dynasty|Song era]], whose leaders very often corresponded to local political authorities. This pattern continues today with former village Communist Party secretaries elected as temple association bosses (p. 83). He concludes (p. 92): \"In sum, since at least the early twentieth century the majority of local ritual leaders in north China have been products of their own or nearby communities. They have special skills in organization, ritual performance or interaction with the gods, but none are full-time ritual specialists; they have all \u2018kept their day jobs\u2019! As such they are exemplars of ordinary people organizing and carrying out their own cultural traditions, persistent traditions with their own structure, functions and logic that deserve to be understood as such.\"}}\n\nNorthern and southern folk religions also have a different [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of [[Chinese mythology]].<ref>Overmyer, 2009. p. 3: \"[...] there are significant differences between aspects of local religion in the south and north, one of which is the gods who are worshiped.\"; p. 33: \"[...] the veneration in the north of ancient deities attested to in pre-Han sources, deities such as N\u00fcwa, Fuxi and Shennong, the legendary founder of agriculture and herbal medicine. In some instances these gods were worshiped at places believed to be where they originated, with indications of grottoes, temples and festivals for them, some of which continue to exist or have been revived. Of course, these gods were worshiped elsewhere in China as well, though perhaps not with the same sense of original geographical location.\"</ref> Furthermore, [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]] have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern folk religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the heavy importance of [[Chinese mother goddess worship|mother goddess worship]] and shamanism,<ref>Overmyer, 2009. p. 15: \"[...] Popular religious sects with their own forms of organization, leaders, deities, rituals, beliefs and scripture texts were active throughout the Ming and Qing periods, particularly in north China. Individuals and families who joined them were promised special divine protection in this life and the next by leaders who functioned both as ritual masters and missionaries. These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non-sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters ''mu'' or ''Laomu'', Mother or Venerable Mother, as in ''Guanyin Laomu'', ''Puxianmu'', ''Dizangmu'', etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, ''Wusheng Laomu'', the Eternal Venerable Mother. ''Puxian'' and ''Dizang'' are bodhisattvas normally considered \u2018male\u2019, though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don\u2019t really apply.

The popularity of these Daoist activities underscores the fact that Chinese rural society has a long tradition of religiosity and has preserved and perpetuated Daoism regardless of official policy and religious institutions. With the growth of economic prosperity in rural areas, especially in the coastal provinces where Daoist activities are concentrated, with a more liberal policy on religion, and with the revival of local cultural identity, Daoism - be it the officially sanctioned variety or Daoist activities which are beyond the edge of the official Daoist body - seems to be enjoying a strong comeback, at least for the time being.\"</ref><ref name=\"Overmyer-2009-southeast-Daoism\">Overmyer, 2009. p. 185 about Taoism in southeastern China: \"Ethnographic research into the temple festivals and communal rituals celebrated within these god cults has revealed the widespread distribution of Daoist ritual traditions in this area, including especially Zhengyi (Celestial Master Daoism) and variants of Lushan Daoist ritual traditions.

The title of \"Queen of Heaven\" ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u540e}} ''Ti\u0101nh\u00f2u'') is most frequently attributed to Mazu and Doumu (the cosmic goddess).\n\n===Worship and modalities of religious practice===\n[[File:Procession with xingshen (traveling image of the god) in central Taiwan.jpg|thumb|Procession with a traveling image of a god (''x\u00edngsh\u00e9n'' {{lang|zh|\u884c\u795e}}) in

Guangdong (inside) (4).jpg|thumb|A Taoist rite for ancestor worship at the [[Xiao (surname)|Xiao]] [[ancestral temple]] of [[Chaoyang District, Shantou|Chaoyang]], [[Shantou]], [[Guangdong]].]]\nAdam Yuet Chau identifies five styles or modalities of \"doing\" Chinese religion:{{sfnb|Chau|2011}}\n* Discursive-scriptural: involving the composition, preaching, and recitation of texts ([[Chinese classics|classics]], Taoist scriptures and morality books);\n* Personal cultivation mode, involving a long-term cultivation and transformation of oneself with the goal of becoming a ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' {{lang|zh|\u4ed9}} (immortal), ''[[zhenren]]'' {{lang|zh|\u771f\u4eba}} (\"true person\"), or ''shengren'' (wise), through the practice of different \"technologies of the self\" (''[[qigong]]'' {{lang|zh|\u6c23\u529f}}, [[Chinese alchemy|Taoist inner and outer alchemy]], charitable acts for merit, memorisation and recitation of texts);\n* Liturgical: involving elaborate ritual procedures conducted by specialists of rites (Taoist rites, Confucian rites, Nuo rites, ''[[fengshui]]'' {{lang|zh|\u98a8\u6c34}});\n* Immediate practical: aiming at quick efficacious (''ling'' {{lang|zh|\u9748}}) results through simple ritual and magical techniques ([[divination]], [[talisman]]s, divine medicine, consulting media and shamans);\n* Relational: emphasising the devotional relationship between men and deities and among men themselves (organising elaborate [[sacrifice]]s, making vows, organising temple festivals, [[pilgrimage]]s, processions, and religious communities) in \"social comings and goings\" (''laiwang'' {{lang|zh|\u4f86\u5f80}}) and \"interconnectedness\" (''[[guanxi]]'' {{lang|zh|\u95dc\u4fc2}}).\n\nGenerally speaking, the Chinese believe that spiritual and material well-being ensues from the harmony of humanity and gods in their participation in the same cosmic power, and also believe that by taking the right path and practice anybody is able to reach the absolute reality.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 173\">Yao, 2010. p. 173</ref> Religious practice is therefore regarded as the bridge to link the human world to the spiritual source,<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 173\"/> maintaining the harmony of the micro and macrocosmos, protecting the individual and the world from disruption.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183\"/> In this sense, the Chinese view of human life is not deterministic, but one is a master of his own life and can choose to collaborate with the deities for a harmonious world.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183\"/>\nChinese culture being a [[holism|holistic]] system, in which every aspect is a part of a whole, Chinese folk religious practice is often intermingled with political, educational and economic concerns.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 172\">Yao, 2010. p. 172</ref> A gathering or event may be encompassed with all of these aspects; in general, the commitment (belief) and the process or rite (practice) together form the internal and external dimensions of Chinese religious life.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 172\"/> In village communities, religious services are often organised and led by local people themselves.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9\"/> Leaders are usually selected among male heads of families or lineages, or village heads.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9\"/>\n\nA simple form of individual practice is to show respect for the gods (''jing shen'' {{lang|zh|\u656c\u795e}}) through ''[[jingxiang]]'' (incense offering), and the exchange of vows (''huan yuan'' {{lang|zh|\u9084\u9858}}).<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183\"/> Sacrifice can consist of incense, oil, and candles, as well as money.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10</ref> Religious devotion may also express in the form of performance troupes (''huahui''), involving many types of professionals such as stilt walkers, lion dancers, musicians, martial arts masters, ''[[yangge]]'' dancers, and story-tellers.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10\"/>\n\nDeities can also be respected through moral deeds in their name (''shanshi'' {{lang|zh|\u5584\u4e8b}}), and self-cultivation (''xiuxing'' {{lang|zh|\u4fee\u884c}}).<ref>Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 191</ref> Some forms of folk religion develop clear prescriptions for believers, such as detailed lists of meritorious and sinful deeds in the form of \"morality books\" (''shanshu'' {{lang|zh|\u5584\u66f8}}) and ledgers of merit and demerit.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182\">Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182</ref> Involvement in the affairs of communal or intra-village temples are perceived by believers as ways for accumulating merit (''gongde'' {{lang|zh|\u529f\u5fb7}}).<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182\"/> Virtue is believed to accumulate in one's heart, which is seen as energetic centre of the human body (''zai jun xin zuo tian fu'' {{lang|zh|\u5728\u541b\u5fc3\u4f5c\u798f\u7530}}).<ref>Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 187</ref> Practices of communication with the gods comprehend different forms of Chinese shamanism, such as [[wu (shaman)|''wu'' shamanism]] and [[tongji (spirit medium)|''tongji'' mediumship]], or ''[[fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' practice.\n\n====Sacrifices====\n[[File:\u9a6c\u964d\u9f99 04 - \u732a\u8089\u76d8.jpg|thumb|Tray for offering sacrifices, on display in [[Kaiping]]]]\n[[Classical Chinese]] has characters for different types of [[sacrifice]], probably the oldest way to communicate with divine forces, today generally encompassed by the definition ''j\u00ecs\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u796d\u7940}}.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 173\"/> However different in scale and quantity, all types of sacrifice would normally involve food, wine, meat and later incense.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\">Yao, 2010. p. 176</ref>\n\nSacrifices usually differ according to the kind of deity they are devoted to.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/> Traditionally, cosmic and nature gods are offered uncooked (or whole) food, while ancestors are offered cooked food.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/> Moreover, sacrifices for gods are made inside the temples that enshrine them, while sacrifices for ancestors are made outside temples.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/> Yearly sacrifices (''ji'') are made to Confucius, the Red and Yellow Emperors, and other cultural heroes and ancestors.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/>\n\nBoth in past history and at the present, all sacrifices are assigned with both religious and political purposes.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 177\">Yao, 2010. p. 177</ref> Some gods are considered carnivorous, for example the River God ({{lang|zh|\u6cb3\u795e}} ''H\u00e9sh\u00e9n'') and Dragon Gods, and offering to them requires animal sacrifice.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189\">Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189</ref>\n\n====Thanksgiving and redeeming====\nThe aims of rituals and sacrifices may be of thanksgiving and redeeming, usually involving both.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 177\"/> Various sacrifices are intended to express gratitude toward the gods in the hope that spiritual blessing and protection will continue.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 177\"/> The ''ji\u00e0o'' {{lang|zh|\u91ae}}, an elaborate Taoist sacrifice or \"rite of universal salvation\", is intended to be a cosmic community renewal, that is to say a reconciliation of a community around its spiritual centre.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\">Yao, 2010. p. 178</ref> The ''jiao'' ritual usually starts with ''zhai'', \"fasting and purification\", that is meant as an atonement for evil-doing, then followed by sacrificial offerings.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/>\n\nThis rite, of great political importance, can be intended for the whole nation.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/> In fact, as early as the [[Song dynasty]], emperors asked renowned Taoists to perform such rituals on their behalf or for the entire nation.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/> The modern Chinese republic has given approval for Taoists to conduct such rituals since the 1990s, with the aim of protecting the country and the nation.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/>\n\n====Rites of passage====\n[[File:\u660e\u5236\u51a0\u79ae.jpg|thumb|''[[Guan Li]]'', Confucian [[coming of age]] ceremony.]]\nA variety of practices are concerned with personal well-being and spiritual growth.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\">Yao, 2010. p. 180</ref> [[Rites of passage]] are intended to narrate the holy significance of each crucial change throughout a life course.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\"/> These changes, which are physical and social and at the same time spiritual, are marked by elaborate customs and religious rituals.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\"/>\n\nIn the holistic view about nature and the human body and life, as macro and microcosmos, the life process of a human being is equated with the rhythm of seasons and cosmic changes.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\"/> Hence, birth is likened to spring, youth to summer, maturity to autumn and old age to winter.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\"/> There are ritual passages for those who belong to a religious order of priests or monks, and there are the rituals of the stages in a life, the main four being birth, adulthood, marriage and death.<ref>Yao, 2010. p. 181</ref>\n\n===Places of worship===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Examples of temples from two different parts of China: the Temple of the [[Jade

temples of the Chinese religion. Some of these terms have a precise functional use, although with time some confusion has arisen and some of them have been used interchangeably in some contexts. Collective names defining \"temples\" or places of worship are {{lang|zh|\u5bfa\u5edf}} ''s\u00ecmi\u00e0o'' and {{lang|zh|\u5edf\u5b87}} ''mi\u00e0oy\u01d4''.{{sfnb|Li|2009}}\n\nHowever, {{lang|zh|\u5bfa}} ''s\u00ec'', which originally meant a type of residence for imperial officials, with the introduction of [[Buddhism in China]] became associated with Buddhist monasteries as many officials donated their residences to the monks.{{sfnb|Li|2009}} Today ''s\u00ec'' and {{lang|zh|\u5bfa\u9662}} ''s\u00ecyu\u00e0n'' (\"monastery\") are used almost exclusively for Buddhist monasteries, with sporadic exceptions, and ''s\u00ec'' is a component character of names for [[Chinese mosques]]. Another term now mostly associated with Buddhism is {{lang|zh|\u5eb5}} ''\u0101n'', \"thatched hut\", originally a form of dwelling of monks later extended to mean monasteries.{{sfnb|Li|2009}}\n\nTemples can be public, private ({{lang|zh|\u79c1\u5edf}} ''s\u00ecmi\u00e0o'') and household temples ({{lang|zh|\u5bb6\u5edf}} ji\u0101mi\u00e0o). The ''jing'' {{lang|zh|\u5883}} is a broader \"territory of a god\", a geographic region or a village or city with its surroundings, marked by multiple temples or complexes of temples and delineated by the processions.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=25}}\n\nPertaining to Chinese religion the most common term is {{lang|zh|\u5edf}} ''mi\u00e0o'' graphically meaning a \"shrine\" or \"sacred enclosure\"; it is the general Chinese term that is translated with the general Western \"[[temple]]\", and is used for temples of any of the deities of polytheism. Other terms include {{lang|zh|\u6bbf}} ''di\u00e0n'' which indicates the \"house\" of a god, enshrining one specific god, usually a chapel within a larger temple or sacred enclosure; and {{lang|zh|\u58c7}} ''t\u00e1n'' which means \"[[altar]]\" and refers to any indoor or outdoor altars, majestic outdoor altars being those for the worship of Heaven and Earth and other gods of the environment.{{sfnb|Li|2009}} {{lang|zh|\u5bae}} ''G\u014dng'', originally referring to imperial palaces, became associated to temples of representations of the universal God or the highest gods and consorts, such as the Queen of Heaven.{{sfnb|Li|2009}}\n\nAnother group of words is used for the [[ancestral shrine|temples of ancestral religion]]: {{lang|zh|\u7960}} ''c\u00ed'' (either \"temple\" or \"shrine\", meaning a sacred enclosure) or {{lang|zh|\u5b97\u7960}} ''z\u014dngc\u00ed'' (\"ancestor shrine\"). These terms are also used for temples dedicated to [[xian (Taoism)|immortal beings]].{{sfnb|Li|2009}} {{lang|zh|\u7956\u5edf}} ''Z\u01d4mi\u00e0o'' (\"original temple\") instead refers to a temple which is believed to be the original temple of a deity, the most legitimate and powerful.<ref>Tan, Chee-Beng.

Routledge, 2013. {{ISBN|1136230963}}. p. 423</ref>\n\n{{lang|zh|\u5802}} ''T\u00e1ng'', meaning \"hall\" or \"church hall\", originally referred to the central hall of secular buildings but it entered religious usage as a place of worship of the [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]].{{sfnb|Li|2009}} [[Christianity in China]] has borrowed this term from the sects.\n\n{{lang|zh|\u89c0}} ''Gu\u00e0n'' is the appropriate Chinese translation of the Western term \"temple\", as both refer to \"[[contemplation]]\" (of the divine, according to the astral patterns in the sky or the icon of a deity). Together with its extension {{lang|zh|\u9053\u89c0}} ''d\u00e0ogu\u00e0n'' (\"to contemplate or observe the Dao\"), it is used exclusively for [[Taoist temple]]s and monasteries of the state [[Taoist Church]].{{sfnb|Li|2009}}\n\nGeneric terms include {{lang|zh|\u9662}} ''yu\u00e0n'' meaning \"sanctuary\", from the secular usage for a courtyard, college or hospital institution; {{lang|zh|\u5ca9}} ''y\u00e1n'' (\"rock\") and {{lang|zh|\u6d1e}} ''d\u00f2ng'' (\"hole\", \"cave\") referring to temples set up in caves or on cliffs. Other generic terms are {{lang|zh|\u5e9c}} ''f\u01d4'' (\"house\"), originally of imperial officials, which is a rarely used term; and {{lang|zh|\u4ead}} ''t\u00edng'' (\"pavilion\") which refers to the areas of a temple where laypeople can stay.{{sfnb|Li|2009}} There is also {{lang|zh|\u795e\u7960}} ''sh\u00e9nc\u00ed'', \"shrine of a god\".\n\nAncestral shrines are sacred places in which lineages of related families, identified by shared [[Chinese surname|surnames]], worship their common progenitors. These temples are the \"collective representation\" of a group, and function as centers where religious, social and economic activities intersect.<ref>Zai Liang, Steven Messner, Cheng Chen, Youqin Huang.

Lexington Books, 2013. {{ISBN|0739188089}}. p. 95</ref>\n\nChinese temples are traditionally built according to the styles and materials (wood and bricks) of [[Chinese architecture]], and this continues to be the rule for most of the new temples. However, in the early 20th century and especially in the mainland religious revival of the early 21st century, there has been a proliferation of new styles in temple construction. These include the use of new materials (stones and concrete, stainless steel and glass) and the combination of Chinese traditional shapes with styles of the West or of transnational modernity. Examples can be found in the large ceremonial complexes of mainland China.\n\n====Temple networks and gatherings====\n[[File:GwongFuMiuWui (SingWongMiu).jpg|thumb|Gathering at a Temple of the City God of [[Guangzhou]], Guangdong.]]\n{{Main|Fenxiang|Miaohui}}\n{{lang|zh|\u5206\u9999}} ''F\u0113nxi\u0101ng'', meaning an \"incense division\", is a term that defines both hierarchical networks of temples dedicated to a god, and the ritual process by which these networks form.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} These temple networks are economic and social bodies, and in certain moments of history have even taken military functions.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} They also represent routes of [[pilgrimage]], with communities of devotees from the affiliated temples going up in the hierarchy to the senior temple (''zumiao'').{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}\n\nWhen a new temple dedicated to the same god is founded, it enters the network through the ritual of division of incense. This consists in filling the incense burner of the new temple with ashes brought from the incense burner of an existing temple.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} The new temple is therefore spiritually affiliated to the older temple where the ashes were taken, and directly below it in the hierarchy of temples.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}\n\n{{lang|zh|\u5edf\u6703}} ''Mi\u00e0ohu\u00ec'', literally \"gatherings at the temple\", are \"collective rituals to greet the gods\" ({{lang|zh|\u8fce\u795e\u8cfd\u6703}} ''y\u00edngsh\u00e9n s\u00e0ihu\u00ec'') that are held at the temples on various occasione such as the [[Chinese New Year]] or the birthday or holiday of the god enshrined in the temple.<ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite book |last = Davis |first = Edward L. |year = 2009 |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture |publisher = Taylor & Francis |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2rLBvrlKI7QC |isbn = 978-0415777162 |ref = harv}} pp. 815-816</ref> In north Chine they are also called {{lang|zh|\u8cfd\u6703}} ''s\u00e0ihu\u00ec'' (\"communal ritual gatherings\") or {{lang|zh|\u9999\u6703}} ''xi\u0101nghu\u00ec'' (\"incense gatherings\"), while a {{lang|zh|\u8cfd\u793e}} ''s\u00e0ish\u00e8'' (\"communal ritual body\") is the association which organises such events and by extension it has become another name of the event itself.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=94}}\n\nActivities include rituals, theatrical performances, processions of the gods' images throughout villages and cities, and offerings to the temples.<ref name=\"Davis\"/> In north China temple gatherings are generally week-long and large events attracting tens of thousands of people, while in south China they tend to be smaller and village-based events.<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n===Mainland China and Taiwan===\n[[File:\u6cb3\u5317\u6885\u82b1\u5723\u5730\u5e08\u7956\u6bbf.jpg|thumb|Temple of the Founding Father ({{lang|zh|\u5e2b\u7956\u6bbf}} ''Sh\u012bz\u01d4di\u00e0n'') of the principal holy see ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u5730}} ''sh\u00e8ngd\u00ec'') of the [[Meihuaism|Plum Flower]] folk religious sect in [[Xingtai]], [[Hebei]].]]\nAccording to Yang and Hu (2012):\n::\"Chinese folk religion deserves serious research and better understanding in the social scientific study of religion.

In contrast to [[Max Weber|Weberian]] predictions, these phenomena suggest that drastic economic development in the Pearl River Delta may not lead to total disenchantment with beliefs concerning magic in the cosmos. On the contrary, the revival of folk religions in the Delta region is serving as a countervailing re-embedding force from the local cultural context, leading to the coexistence of the world of enchantments and the modern world.\"{{sfnb|Law|2005|p=90}}\n\n[[Mayfair Yang]] (2007) defines it as an \"embedded capitalism\", which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an \"ethical capitalism\" in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity which foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society.{{sfnb|Yang|2007|p=223}}\n\n===Overseas Chinese===\n[[File:Yokohama Masobyo 2013-05-05.JPG|thumb|[[Temple of Mazu, Yokohama|Temple of Mazu]] in [[Yokohama]], serving the [[Chinese people in Japan|Chinese of Japan]].]]\n{{Main|Chinese folk religion in Southeast Asia}}\nMost of the [[overseas Chinese]] populations have maintained Chinese folk religions, often adapting to the new environment by developing new cults and incorporating elements of local traditions. In [[Southeast Asia]], Chinese deities are subject to a \"re-territorialisation\" and maintain their relation to the ethnic associations (i.e. the Hainanese Association or the Fujianese Association, each of them has a patron deity and manages one or more temples of such a deity).<ref name=\"Tan\">Tan, Chee-Beng.

According to Chen Xiaoyi {{lang|zh|\u9673\u66c9\u6bc5}} local indigenous religion is the crucial factor for a harmonious \"religious ecology\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b97\u6559\u751f\u614b}}), that is the balance of forces in a given community.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=405}} Professor Han Bingfang {{lang|zh|\u97d3\u79c9\u82b3}} has called for a [[rectification of names|rectification of distorted names]] ({{lang|zh|\u6b63\u540d}}). Distorted names are \"superstitious activities\" ({{lang|zh|\u8ff7\u4fe1\u6d3b\u52d5}}) or \"feudal superstition\" ({{lang|zh|\u5c01\u5efa\u8ff7\u4fe1}}), that were derogatorily applied to the indigenous religion by leftist policies. Christian missionaries also used the propaganda label \"feudal superstition\" in order to undermine their religious competitor.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408}} Han calls for the acknowledgment of the ancient Chinese religion for what it really is, the \"core and soul of popular culture\" ({{lang|zh|\u4fd7\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8207\u9748\u9b42}}).{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=407}}\n\nAccording to Chen Jinguo {{lang|zh|\u9673\u9032\u570b}}, the ancient Chinese religion is a core element of Chinese cultural and religious self-awareness ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u5316\u81ea\u89ba, \u4fe1\u4ef0\u81ea\u89ba}}).{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408}} He has proposed a theoretical definition of Chinese indigenous religion in \"three inseparable attributes\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u9ad4}}), apparently inspired to [[Tang Junyi]]'s thought:{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=408-409}}\n* substance (''t\u01d0'' {{lang|zh|\u9ad4}}): religiousness (''z\u014dngji\u00e0o x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u5b97\u6559\u6027}});\n* function (''y\u00f2ng'' {{lang|zh|\u7528}}): folkloricity (''m\u00edns\u00fa x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u6c11\u4fd7\u6027}});\n* quality (''xi\u00e0ng'' {{lang|zh|\u76f8}}): Chineseness (''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6027}}).\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See also|Chinese creation myth|Chinese spiritual world concepts}}\n[[File:Worship at the Great Temple of Shennong-Yandi in Suizhou, Hubei.jpg|thumb|Communal ceremony at the Great Temple of [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] [[Shennong]] ({{lang|zh|\u708e\u5e1d\u795e\u8fb2\u5927\u6bbf}} ''Y\u00e1nd\u00ec Sh\u00e9nn\u00f3ng d\u00e0di\u00e0n'') in [[Suizhou]], [[Hubei]].]]\n[[File:\u5abd\u7956\u5a18\u5a18002.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] at a temple in [[Chiayi City|Chiayi]], [[Taiwan]].]]\n\n===Diversity and unity===\n\nAncient Chinese religious practices are diverse, varying from province to province and even from one village to another, for religious behaviour is bound to local communities, kinship, and environments. In each setting, institution and ritual behaviour assumes highly organised forms. Temples and the gods in them acquire symbolic character and perform specific functions involved in the everyday life of the local community.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5</ref> Local religion preserves aspects of natural beliefs such as [[Totem|totemism]],<ref name=\"Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61\">Wang, 2004. pp. 60-61</ref> [[animism]], and [[shamanism]].<ref>Fenggang Yang, ''Social Scientific Studies of Religion in China: Methodologies, Theories, and Findings ''. BRILL, 2011. {{ISBN|9004182462}}. p. 112</ref>\n\nAncient Chinese religion pervades all aspects of social life. Many scholars, following the lead of sociologist [[C. K. Yang (sociologist)|C. K. Yang]], see the ancient Chinese religion deeply embedded in family and civic life, rather than expressed in a separate organisational structure like a \"church,\" as in the West.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4.</ref>\n\nDeity or temple associations and [[Chinese lineage associations|lineage associations]], pilgrimage associations and formalised prayers, rituals and expressions of virtues, are the common forms of organisation of Chinese religion on the local level.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\"/> Neither initiation rituals nor official membership into a church organisation separate from one person's native identity are mandatory in order to be involved in religious activities.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\"/> Contrary to institutional religions, Chinese religion does not require \"conversion\" for participation.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 4\"/>\n\nThe prime criterion for participation in the ancient Chinese religion is not \"to believe\" in an official doctrine or [[dogma]], but \"to belong\" to the local unit of an ancient Chinese religion, that is the \"association\", the \"village\" or the \"kinship\", with their gods and rituals.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 5\"/> Scholar Richard Madsen describes the ancient Chinese religion, adopting the definition of [[Tu Weiming]],<ref>Tu Weiming. ''The Global Significance of Concrete Humanity: Essays on the Confucian Discourse in Cultural China''. India Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 2010. {{ISBN|8121512204}} / 9788121512206</ref> as characterised by \"immanent transcendence\" grounded in a devotion to \"concrete humanity\", focused on building moral community within concrete humanity.<ref name=\"Madsen, 2013\">Madsen, ''Secular belief, religious belonging''. 2013.</ref>\n\nInextricably linked to the aforementioned question to find an appropriate \"name\" for the ancient  Chinese religion, is the difficulty to define it or clearly outline its boundaries. Old [[sinology]], especially Western, tried to distinguish \"popular\" and \"\u00e9lite\" traditions (the latter being Confucianism and Taoism conceived as independent systems). Chinese sinology later adopted another dichotomy which continues in contemporary studies, distinguishing \"folk beliefs\" (''minjian xinyang'') and \"folk religion\" (''minjian zongjiao''), the latter referring to the doctrinal sects.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|p=507}}\n\nMany studies have pointed out that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions, and since the 1970s several sinologists{{who|date=April 2020}} swung to the idea of a unified \"ancient Chinese religion\" that would define the Chinese national identity, similarly to Hinduism for [[India]] and Shinto for [[Japan]]. Other sinologists who have not espoused the idea of a unified \"national religion\" have studied Chinese religion as a system of meaning, or have brought further development in C. K. Yang's distinction between \"institutional religion\" and \"diffused religion\", the former functioning as a separate body from other social institutions, and the latter intimately part of secular social institutions.{{sfnb|Yang|Hu|2012|pp=507-508}}\n\n==History==\n=== Imperial China ===\nBy the [[Han dynasty]], the ancient Chinese religion mostly consisted of people organising into ''sh\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u793e}} (\"group\", \"body\", local community altars) who worshipped their godly principle. In many cases the \"lord of the ''she''\" was the god of the earth, and in others a deified virtuous person (''[[xian (Taoism)|xi\u0101n]]'' {{lang|zh|\u4ed9}}, \"immortal\"). Some cults such as that of Liu Zhang, a king in what is today [[Shandong]], date back to this period.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=36-37}}\n\nFrom the 3rd century on by the [[Northern Wei]], accompanying the spread of [[Buddhism]] in China, strong influences from the Indian subcontinent penetrated the ancient Chinese indigenous religion.

The [[Kuomingtang]] government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] intensified the suppression of the ancient Chinese religion with the 1928 \"Standards for retaining or abolishing gods and shrines\"; the policy abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}}\n\nThese policies were the background of those that were implemented in [[Communist Party of China|communist]] [[China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Communist Party of China|communist]] [[China|People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)]] and the [[democracy|democratic]] [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] in 1949.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}} The [[Cultural Revolution]] between 1966 and 1976 of the [[history of the People's Republic of China (1949\u201376)|Chairman Mao period]] in the [[Communist Party of China|communist]] [[China|People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)]] was the last systematic effort to destroy the ancient Chinese religion while in [[Taiwan]] the ancient Chinese religion was both preserved and promoted by [[President of the Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan) president]] [[Chiang Kai-Shek]] during his [[Chinese Cultural Renaissance]] to counter the communist Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9\"/>{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}}\n\nAfter 1978 the ancient Chinese religion started to rapidly revive in China,<ref>Fan, Chen 2013. p. 1</ref><ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8</ref> with millions of temples being rebuilt or built from scratch.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8\"/> Since the 1980s the central government moved to a policy of benign neglect or ''[[wu wei]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u7121\u70ba}}) in regard to rural community life, and the local government's new regulatory relationship with local society is characterized by practical mutual dependence; these factors have given much space for popular religion to develop.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8\"/> In recent years, in some cases, local governments have taken an even positive and supportive attitude towards indigenous religion in the name of promoting cultural heritage.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 8\"/>{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=52}}\n\nInstead of signaling the demise of traditional ancient religion, [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]\u2019s economic and technological industrialization and development has brought a spiritual renewal.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28</ref> As its images and practices integrate the codes of the ancient Chinese culture, the ancient Chinese religion provides the [[Han Chinese]] people in both [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] a means to face the challenges of modernisation.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 28\"/>\n\n==Texts==\n{{Further|Chinese classics}}\n[[File:\u5fe0\u7e23\u4e01\u623f\u96d9\u95d502.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern Han]] (25-220 AD) Chinese stone-carved [[Que (tower)|que pillar gates]] of Dingfang, [[Zhong County]], [[Chongqing]] that once belonged to a [[Chinese temple|temple]] dedicated to the [[Warring States]] era general [[Ba Manzi]]]]\nAncient Chinese religion draws from a vast heritage of sacred books, which according to the general worldview treat [[cosmology]], history and mythology, mysticism and philosophy, as aspects of the same thing.

Historically speaking, these areas had the strong lineage organizations and the territorial cult, compared to the rest of China in the late imperial period.

This phenomena is furthered referred as the southern model, based on the south-vs.-north model. The north model refers to the absence of landholding cooperative lineages that exist in the south.\" Note 16: The south-vs.-north model comparison has been the thrust of historical and anthropological research. Cohen\u2019s article on \"Lineage organization in North China (1990)\" offers the best summary on the contrast between the north model and the south model. He calls the north China model \"the fixed genealogical mode of agnatic kinship.\" By which, he means \"patrilineal ties are figured on the basis of the relative seniority of descent lines so that the unity of the lineage as a whole is based upon a ritual focus on the senior descent line trace back to the founding ancestor, his eldest son, and the succession of eldest sons.\" (ibid: 510) In contrast, the south China model is called \"the associational mode of patrilineal kinship.\" In this mode, all lines of descent are equal. \"Access to corporate resources held by a lineage or lineage segment is based upon the equality of kinship ties asserted in the associational mode.\" However, the distinction between the north and the south model is somewhat arbitrary. Some practices of the south model are found in north China. Meanwhile, the so-call north model is not exclusive to north China. The set of characteristics of the north model (a distinctive arrangement of cemeteries, graves, ancestral scrolls, ancestral tablets, and corporate groups linked to a characteristic annual ritual cycle) is not a system.

Jones (2007), ''Ritual and Music of North China: Shawm Bands in Shanxi''). He also describes shamans or media known by different names: ''mapi'' {{lang|zh|\u99ac\u88e8}}, ''wupo'' {{lang|zh|\u5deb\u5a46}}, ''shen momo'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b24\u5b24}} or ''shen han'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u6f22}} (p. 87); ''xingdao de'' {{lang|zh|\u9999\u9053\u7684}} (\"practitioners of the incense way\"; p. 85); village ''xiangtou'' {{lang|zh|\u9999\u982d}} (\"incense heads\"; p. 86); ''matong'' {{lang|zh|\u99ac\u7ae5}} (the same as southern ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]''), either ''wushen'' {{lang|zh|\u5deb\u795e}} (possessed by gods) or ''shenguan'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u5b98}} (possessed by immortals; pp. 88-89); or \"godly sages\" (''shensheng'' {{lang|zh|\u795e\u8056}}; p. 91). Further (p. 76), he discusses for example the ''sai'' {{lang|zh|\u8cfd}}, ceremonies of thanksgiving to the gods in [[Shanxi]] with roots in the [[Song dynasty|Song era]], whose leaders very often corresponded to local political authorities. This pattern continues today with former village Communist Party secretaries elected as temple association bosses (p. 83). He concludes (p. 92): \"In sum, since at least the early twentieth century the majority of local ritual leaders in north China have been products of their own or nearby communities. They have special skills in organization, ritual performance or interaction with the gods, but none are full-time ritual specialists; they have all \u2018kept their day jobs\u2019! As such they are exemplars of ordinary people organizing and carrying out their own cultural traditions, persistent traditions with their own structure, functions and logic that deserve to be understood as such.\"}}\n\nNorthern and southern folk religions also have a different [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of [[Chinese mythology]].<ref>Overmyer, 2009. p. 3: \"[...] there are significant differences between aspects of local religion in the south and north, one of which is the gods who are worshiped.\"; p. 33: \"[...] the veneration in the north of ancient deities attested to in pre-Han sources, deities such as N\u00fcwa, Fuxi and Shennong, the legendary founder of agriculture and herbal medicine. In some instances these gods were worshiped at places believed to be where they originated, with indications of grottoes, temples and festivals for them, some of which continue to exist or have been revived. Of course, these gods were worshiped elsewhere in China as well, though perhaps not with the same sense of original geographical location.\"</ref> Furthermore, [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]] have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern folk religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the heavy importance of [[Chinese mother goddess worship|mother goddess worship]] and shamanism,<ref>Overmyer, 2009. p. 15: \"[...] Popular religious sects with their own forms of organization, leaders, deities, rituals, beliefs and scripture texts were active throughout the Ming and Qing periods, particularly in north China. Individuals and families who joined them were promised special divine protection in this life and the next by leaders who functioned both as ritual masters and missionaries. These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non-sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters ''mu'' or ''Laomu'', Mother or Venerable Mother, as in ''Guanyin Laomu'', ''Puxianmu'', ''Dizangmu'', etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, ''Wusheng Laomu'', the Eternal Venerable Mother. ''Puxian'' and ''Dizang'' are bodhisattvas normally considered \u2018male\u2019, though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don\u2019t really apply.

The popularity of these Daoist activities underscores the fact that Chinese rural society has a long tradition of religiosity and has preserved and perpetuated Daoism regardless of official policy and religious institutions. With the growth of economic prosperity in rural areas, especially in the coastal provinces where Daoist activities are concentrated, with a more liberal policy on religion, and with the revival of local cultural identity, Daoism - be it the officially sanctioned variety or Daoist activities which are beyond the edge of the official Daoist body - seems to be enjoying a strong comeback, at least for the time being.\"</ref><ref name=\"Overmyer-2009-southeast-Daoism\">Overmyer, 2009. p. 185 about Taoism in southeastern China: \"Ethnographic research into the temple festivals and communal rituals celebrated within these god cults has revealed the widespread distribution of Daoist ritual traditions in this area, including especially Zhengyi (Celestial Master Daoism) and variants of Lushan Daoist ritual traditions.

The title of \"Queen of Heaven\" ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u540e}} ''Ti\u0101nh\u00f2u'') is most frequently attributed to Mazu and Doumu (the cosmic goddess).\n\n===Worship and modalities of religious practice===\n[[File:Procession with xingshen (traveling image of the god) in central Taiwan.jpg|thumb|Procession with a traveling image of a god (''x\u00edngsh\u00e9n'' {{lang|zh|\u884c\u795e}}) in

Yuet Chau identifies five styles or modalities of \"doing\" Chinese religion:{{sfnb|Chau|2011}}\n* Discursive-scriptural: involving the composition, preaching, and recitation of texts ([[Chinese classics|classics]], Taoist scriptures and morality books);\n* Personal cultivation mode, involving a long-term cultivation and transformation of oneself with the goal of becoming a ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' {{lang|zh|\u4ed9}} (immortal), ''[[zhenren]]'' {{lang|zh|\u771f\u4eba}} (\"true person\"), or ''shengren'' (wise), through the practice of different \"technologies of the self\" (''[[qigong]]'' {{lang|zh|\u6c23\u529f}}, [[Chinese alchemy|Taoist inner and outer alchemy]], charitable acts for merit, memorisation and recitation of texts);\n* Liturgical: involving elaborate ritual procedures conducted by specialists of rites (Taoist rites, Confucian rites, Nuo rites, ''[[fengshui]]'' {{lang|zh|\u98a8\u6c34}});\n* Immediate practical: aiming at quick efficacious (''ling'' {{lang|zh|\u9748}}) results through simple ritual and magical techniques ([[divination]], [[talisman]]s, divine medicine, consulting media and shamans);\n* Relational: emphasising the devotional relationship between men and deities and among men themselves (organising elaborate [[sacrifice]]s, making vows, organising temple festivals, [[pilgrimage]]s, processions, and religious communities) in \"social comings and goings\" (''laiwang'' {{lang|zh|\u4f86\u5f80}}) and \"interconnectedness\" (''[[guanxi]]'' {{lang|zh|\u95dc\u4fc2}}).\n\nGenerally speaking, the Chinese believe that spiritual and material well-being ensues from the harmony of humanity and gods in their participation in the same cosmic power, and also believe that by taking the right path and practice anybody is able to reach the absolute reality.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 173\">Yao, 2010. p. 173</ref> Religious practice is therefore regarded as the bridge to link the human world to the spiritual source,<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 173\"/> maintaining the harmony of the micro and macrocosmos, protecting the individual and the world from disruption.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183\"/> In this sense, the Chinese view of human life is not deterministic, but one is a master of his own life and can choose to collaborate with the deities for a harmonious world.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183\"/>\nChinese culture being a [[holism|holistic]] system, in which every aspect is a part of a whole, Chinese folk religious practice is often intermingled with political, educational and economic concerns.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 172\">Yao, 2010. p. 172</ref> A gathering or event may be encompassed with all of these aspects; in general, the commitment (belief) and the process or rite (practice) together form the internal and external dimensions of Chinese religious life.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 172\"/> In village communities, religious services are often organised and led by local people themselves.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9\"/> Leaders are usually selected among male heads of families or lineages, or village heads.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 9\"/>\n\nA simple form of individual practice is to show respect for the gods (''jing shen'' {{lang|zh|\u656c\u795e}}) through ''[[jingxiang]]'' (incense offering), and the exchange of vows (''huan yuan'' {{lang|zh|\u9084\u9858}}).<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 183\"/> Sacrifice can consist of incense, oil, and candles, as well as money.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10\">Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10</ref> Religious devotion may also express in the form of performance troupes (''huahui''), involving many types of professionals such as stilt walkers, lion dancers, musicians, martial arts masters, ''[[yangge]]'' dancers, and story-tellers.<ref name=\"Fan, Chen 2013. p. 10\"/>\n\nDeities can also be respected through moral deeds in their name (''shanshi'' {{lang|zh|\u5584\u4e8b}}), and self-cultivation (''xiuxing'' {{lang|zh|\u4fee\u884c}}).<ref>Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 191</ref> Some forms of folk religion develop clear prescriptions for believers, such as detailed lists of meritorious and sinful deeds in the form of \"morality books\" (''shanshu'' {{lang|zh|\u5584\u66f8}}) and ledgers of merit and demerit.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182\">Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182</ref> Involvement in the affairs of communal or intra-village temples are perceived by believers as ways for accumulating merit (''gongde'' {{lang|zh|\u529f\u5fb7}}).<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 182\"/> Virtue is believed to accumulate in one's heart, which is seen as energetic centre of the human body (''zai jun xin zuo tian fu'' {{lang|zh|\u5728\u541b\u5fc3\u4f5c\u798f\u7530}}).<ref>Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 187</ref> Practices of communication with the gods comprehend different forms of Chinese shamanism, such as [[wu (shaman)|''wu'' shamanism]] and [[tongji (spirit medium)|''tongji'' mediumship]], or ''[[fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]'' practice.\n\n====Sacrifices====\n[[File:\u9a6c\u964d\u9f99 04 -

types of sacrifice would normally involve food, wine, meat and later incense.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\">Yao, 2010. p. 176</ref>\n\nSacrifices usually differ according to the kind of deity they are devoted to.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/> Traditionally, cosmic and nature gods are offered uncooked (or whole) food, while ancestors are offered cooked food.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/> Moreover, sacrifices for gods are made inside the temples that enshrine them, while sacrifices for ancestors are made outside temples.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/> Yearly sacrifices (''ji'') are made to Confucius, the Red and Yellow Emperors, and other cultural heroes and ancestors.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 176\"/>\n\nBoth in past history and at the present, all sacrifices are assigned with both religious and political purposes.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 177\">Yao, 2010. p. 177</ref> Some gods are considered carnivorous, for example the River God ({{lang|zh|\u6cb3\u795e}} ''H\u00e9sh\u00e9n'') and Dragon Gods, and offering to them requires animal sacrifice.<ref name=\"Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189\">Zavidovskaya, 2012. p. 189</ref>\n\n====Thanksgiving and redeeming====\nThe aims of rituals and sacrifices may be of thanksgiving and redeeming, usually involving both.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 177\"/> Various sacrifices are intended to express gratitude toward the gods in the hope that spiritual blessing and protection will continue.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 177\"/> The ''ji\u00e0o'' {{lang|zh|\u91ae}}, an elaborate Taoist sacrifice or \"rite of universal salvation\", is intended to be a cosmic community renewal, that is to say a reconciliation of a community around its spiritual centre.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\">Yao, 2010. p. 178</ref> The ''jiao'' ritual usually starts with ''zhai'', \"fasting and purification\", that is meant as an atonement for evil-doing, then followed by sacrificial offerings.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/>\n\nThis rite, of great political importance, can be intended for the whole nation.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/> In fact, as early as the [[Song dynasty]], emperors asked renowned Taoists to perform such rituals on their behalf or for the entire nation.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/> The modern Chinese republic has given approval for Taoists to conduct such rituals since the 1990s, with the aim of protecting the country and the nation.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 178\"/>\n\n====Rites of passage====\n[[File:\u660e\u5236\u51a0\u79ae.jpg|thumb|''[[Guan Li]]'', Confucian [[coming of

by elaborate customs and religious rituals.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\"/>\n\nIn the holistic view about nature and the human body and life, as macro and microcosmos, the life process of a human being is equated with the rhythm of seasons and cosmic changes.<ref name=\"Yao, 2010. p. 180\"/> Hence, birth is likened to spring, youth to summer, maturity to autumn and old age to winter.<ref

However, in the early 20th century and especially in the mainland religious revival of the early 21st century, there has been a proliferation of new styles in temple construction. These include the use of new materials (stones and concrete, stainless steel and glass) and the combination of Chinese traditional shapes with styles of the West or of transnational modernity.

This consists in filling the incense burner of the new temple with ashes brought from the incense burner of an existing temple.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}} The new temple is therefore spiritually affiliated to the older temple where the ashes were taken, and directly below it in the hierarchy of temples.{{sfn|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=24}}\n\n{{lang|zh|\u5edf\u6703}} ''Mi\u00e0ohu\u00ec'', literally \"gatherings at the temple\", are \"collective rituals to greet the gods\" ({{lang|zh|\u8fce\u795e\u8cfd\u6703}} ''y\u00edngsh\u00e9n s\u00e0ihu\u00ec'') that are held at the temples on various occasione such as the [[Chinese New Year]] or the birthday or holiday of the god enshrined in the temple.<ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite book |last = Davis |first = Edward L. |year = 2009 |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture |publisher = Taylor & Francis |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2rLBvrlKI7QC |isbn = 978-0415777162 |ref = harv}} pp. 815-816</ref> In north Chine they are also called {{lang|zh|\u8cfd\u6703}} ''s\u00e0ihu\u00ec'' (\"communal ritual gatherings\") or {{lang|zh|\u9999\u6703}} ''xi\u0101nghu\u00ec'' (\"incense gatherings\"), while a {{lang|zh|\u8cfd\u793e}} ''s\u00e0ish\u00e8'' (\"communal ritual body\") is the association which organises such events and by extension it has become another name of the event itself.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=94}}\n\nActivities include rituals, theatrical performances, processions of the gods' images throughout villages and cities, and offerings to the temples.<ref name=\"Davis\"/> In north China temple gatherings are generally week-long and large events attracting tens of thousands of people, while in south China they tend to be smaller and village-based events.<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n===Mainland China and Taiwan===\n[[File:\u6cb3\u5317\u6885\u82b1\u5723\u5730\u5e08\u7956\u6bbf.jpg|thumb|Temple of the Founding Father ({{lang|zh|\u5e2b\u7956\u6bbf}} ''Sh\u012bz\u01d4di\u00e0n'') of the principal holy see ({{lang|zh|\u8056\u5730}} ''sh\u00e8ngd\u00ec'') of the [[Meihuaism|Plum Flower]] folk religious sect in [[Xingtai]], [[Hebei]].]]\nAccording to Yang and Hu (2012):\n::\"Chinese folk religion deserves serious research and better understanding in the social scientific study of religion.
