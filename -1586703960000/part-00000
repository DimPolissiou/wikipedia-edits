They can outrun opponents that underestimate {{nowrap|AT-AT}} walking speed, while their neck can pivot quickly enough to bring their heavy weaponry to bear against even fast-moving craft like snowspeeders. Their blasters and laser cannons do not have a high rate of fire, but the shots are powerful enough to destroy most small targets in one to two shots. Their armor is resistant to most standard blaster weapons; however, the \"neck\" column of the walker holds no such invulnerability and, if shot, can cause the entire walker to be destroyed.\n\nThe AT-AT is the primary assault vehicle during the [[Battle of Hoth]], first depicted in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. In the film, the squadron of {{nowrap|AT-ATs}}, lead by General Maximilian Veers, are responsible for destroying the shield generator protecting the Rebel headquarters, taking out soldiers, artillery batteries, and snowspeeders in the process. [[Luke Skywalker]], realizing that the walkers are all but impervious to artillery and snowspeeder blaster fire, orders his squadron's [[snowspeeder]]s to entangle their legs with [[tow cable]]s, a trick he remembered using on Tatooine to rein in hard-to-control farm animals. [[Wedge Antilles]] and his gunner Wes Janson successfully bring down an AT-AT using the tow cable: shortly after, another snowspeeder scores a direct hit on the fallen AT-AT's neck, causing a huge explosion. Skywalker, after being shot down and narrowly escaping his stricken snowspeeder before it is crushed beneath the AT-AT's leg, used his hoist cable to latch upon that AT-AT's underside, with a slash of his Lightsaber cutting away a panel so he can toss a thermal detonator inside, causing a series of internal explosions culminating with the cockpit and the walker toppling over. In the novelization of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', General Veers' {{nowrap|AT-AT}} is destroyed when its cockpit is rammed by a snowspeeder piloted by Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian, however this never made it into the final cut of the film.\n\nAn AT-AT makes a brief appearance in ''Return of the Jedi''; one walks up alongside a landing platform on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] to deliver Luke to [[Darth Vader]]. \n\nThe first appearance of an {{nowrap|AT-AT}} in the ''Star Wars Rebels'' TV series occurs in [[List of Star Wars Rebels episodes#Season 2 (2015)|the second-season episode]] \"Relics of the Old Republic\", when [[Agent Kallus]] unsuccessfully confronts the rebels while on Seelos, with a trio of the four-legged walkers challenging Captain Rex's retired clone cohorts and their own much-modified {{nowrap|AT-TE}} six-legged walker, where the rebels are hiding out. This walker is significantly bigger than those seen in the films and depicts an earlier model.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nA ruined {{nowrap|AT-AT}} appears in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' as the makeshift home of the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] on the planet Jakku.\n\nThe First Order uses an updated model of the AT-AT during the Battle of Crait at the end of ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'' alongside a similar but larger walker called the AT-M6.\n\nThe theme park attraction [[Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance]], set after ''The Last Jedi'', features two full-sized AT-ATs in a hangar bay. These walkers, while mostly static, can move their cannons to allow for a scene in which the walker's drivers spot the ride vehicles and fire at them.\n\n\n==All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST)==\n{{Infobox fictional vehicle\n| name                = All Terrain Scout Transport\n| series              = Star Wars\n| image               = File:Star Wars All Terrain Scout Transport.jpg\n| alt                 =\n| caption             = An AT-ST walker, as depicted in ''Return of the Jedi''\n| first_major         = [[The Empire Strikes Back]]<br /> [[Star Wars Rebels|Rebels]]\n| first_minor         =\n| first_date          =\n| last_major          = [[The Mandalorian]]<br /> [[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order|Jedi: Fallen Order]]\n| last_minor          =\n| last_date           =\n| creator             = Kuat Drive Yards\n| based_on            = <!-- if not an original creation, use {{based on|vehicle|author}} -->\n| affiliation         = First Galactic Imperial Army\n| launched            =\n| decommissioned      =\n| captain             =\n| fighters            =\n| aux_vehicle         = {{plainlist|\n*550 metric tons cargo capacity\n}}\n| class               = Walker\n| registry            =\n| armaments           ={{plainlist|\n*Cheek-mounted Yaove Gunsmiths 88i twin light blaster cannon\n*Cheek-mounted Dymek DW-3 concussion grenade launcher\n*Grenade/Missile launcher\n}}\n| defense             = <!-- or |defence= -->\n| max_speed           = 90 km/h\n| propulsion          =\n| chassis             =\n| power               =\n| mass                =\n| length              = \n| width               =4.5m\n| height              = 9.4m\n| population_volume   = {{plainlist|\n*2 Pilots\n*1 Passenger\n}}\n}}\n\nThe All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) is a two-legged [[mech]] walker introduced briefly in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and featured extensively in ''Return of the Jedi''.

legs. They are used by the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles. [[Industrial Light and Magic]] (ILM) is responsible for their animation and design, often using models, [[stop-motion animation]], and relevant [[matte paintings]] to depict their presence in the films.\n\nThere are a variety of walkers: ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' introduces the All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) and All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST).  ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' introduced earlier models of walkers, such as the All-Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), and the All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT).

They can outrun opponents that underestimate {{nowrap|AT-AT}} walking speed, while their neck can pivot quickly enough to bring their heavy weaponry to bear against even fast-moving craft like snowspeeders. Their blasters and laser cannons do not have a high rate of fire, but the shots are powerful enough to destroy most small targets in one to two shots. Their armor is resistant to most standard blaster weapons; however, the \"neck\" column of the walker holds no such invulnerability and, if shot, can cause the entire walker to be destroyed.\n\nThe AT-AT is the primary assault vehicle during the [[Battle of Hoth]], first depicted in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. In the film, the squadron of {{nowrap|AT-ATs}}, lead by General Maximilian Veers, are responsible for destroying the shield generator protecting the Rebel headquarters, taking out soldiers, artillery batteries, and snowspeeders in the process. [[Luke Skywalker]], realizing that the walkers are all but impervious to artillery and snowspeeder blaster fire, orders his squadron's [[snowspeeder]]s to entangle their legs with [[tow cable]]s, a trick he remembered using on Tatooine to rein in hard-to-control farm animals. [[Wedge Antilles]] and his gunner Wes Janson successfully bring down an AT-AT using the tow cable: shortly after, another snowspeeder scores a direct hit on the fallen AT-AT's neck, causing a huge explosion. Skywalker, after being shot down and narrowly escaping his stricken snowspeeder before it is crushed beneath the AT-AT's leg, used his hoist cable to latch upon that AT-AT's underside, with a slash of his Lightsaber cutting away a panel so he can toss a thermal detonator inside, causing a series of internal explosions culminating with the cockpit and the walker toppling over. In the novelization of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', General Veers' {{nowrap|AT-AT}} is destroyed when its cockpit is rammed by a snowspeeder piloted by Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian, however this never made it into the final cut of the film.\n\nAn AT-AT makes a brief appearance in ''Return of the Jedi''; one walks up alongside a landing platform on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] to deliver Luke to [[Darth Vader]]. \n\nThe first appearance of an {{nowrap|AT-AT}} in the ''Star Wars Rebels'' TV series occurs in [[List of Star Wars Rebels episodes#Season 2 (2015)|the second-season episode]] \"Relics of the Old Republic\", when [[Agent Kallus]] unsuccessfully confronts the rebels while on Seelos, with a trio of the four-legged walkers challenging Captain Rex's retired clone cohorts and their own much-modified {{nowrap|AT-TE}} six-legged walker, where the rebels are hiding out. This walker is significantly bigger than those seen in the films and depicts an earlier model.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nA ruined {{nowrap|AT-AT}} appears in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' as the makeshift home of the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] on the planet Jakku.\n\nThe First Order uses an updated model of the AT-AT during the Battle of Crait at the end of ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi'' alongside a similar but larger walker called the AT-M6.\n\nThe theme park attraction [[Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance]], set after ''The Last Jedi'', features two full-sized AT-ATs in a hangar bay.
