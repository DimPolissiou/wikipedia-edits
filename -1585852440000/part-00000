Corbyn represents the socially liberal values they endorse, and they would prefer to see a purely anti-hard Brexit, anti-Tory approach.\"<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2018/06/why-everyone-hating-these-pro-remain-campaign-groups</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n== External links ==\n\n{{Portal bar|Society|United Kingdom|Brexit|Current events}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Another Europe is Possible}}\n\n[[Category:Brexit]]\n[[Category:Advocacy groups in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{db-spam|help=off}}\n{{short description|European Union reform political campaigning group}}\n{{Use British English|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020|cs1-dates=y}}\n{{Infobox organisation\n| name = Another Europe is Possible\n| named_after = \n| image = \n| image_size = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| logo = \n| formation = {{Nowrap|{{Start date and age|df=y|2016||}}}}\n| founder = \n| founding_location = London, United Kingdom.\n| type = [[Advocacy group]]\n| status = \n| purpose = Political campaigning concerning the UK's relationship with the EU\n| coords = <!-- {{coord|LAT|LON|display=inline, title}} -->\n| region = [[United Kingdom]]\n| fields =\n| key_people = \n| parent_organization = \n| affiliations =  \n}}\n'''Another Europe is Possible''' is a political organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]] which was founded in February 2016 to campaign for the 'Remain' option during the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] (often referred to as the 'Brexit referendum').
