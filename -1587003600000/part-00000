The film stars [[Alec Baldwin]] as Mr. Conductor, [[Peter Fonda]], [[Mara Wilson]], [[Didi Conn]], [[Russell Means]], [[Cody McMains]], [[Michael E. Rodgers]], and [[Edward Glen|Eddie Glen]] as the voice of Thomas. The film is based on the British children's book series ''[[The Railway Series]]'' by [[Wilbert Awdry|The Rev. W. Awdry]], its televised adaptation ''[[Thomas & Friends|Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'', and the American television series ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' by Britt Allcroft and Rick Siggelkow.\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[Gullane Entertainment|Gullane Pictures]] and the [[Isle of Man Film|Isle of Man Film Commission]]. It was distributed by [[Destination Films]] in the [[United States]], [[Icon Productions|Icon Film Distribution]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and [[ABC Films]] in [[Australia]]. The film tells the story of Lily Stone, the granddaughter of the caretaker of an enchanted [[steam engine]] who is lacking an appropriate supply of coal, and Mr. Conductor of Shining Time Station, whose provisions of magical gold dust are at a critical low. To ameliorate these problems, Lily and Mr. Conductor enlist the help of [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]], who confronts the ruthless and devious [[Diesel 10]] who plans to get rid of the railway's steam engines along the way.\n\nPlans for an original ''Thomas & Friends'' film started with [[Paramount Pictures]], but did not pull through. Shortly afterward, [[Destination Films]] began funding for the film and started production in 1998.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\" /> Filming took place at the Strasburg Railroad, Toronto, Canada, and the Isle of Man. It held its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in the United Kingdom on July 9, 2000. The film was reviewed negatively by critics, mainly from the US upon release, with criticism directed towards the acting, plot, special effects, and lack of fidelity towards the source material.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Thomson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/07/13/thomas_magic_railroad_review.shtml |title=Films - review - Thomas and the Magic Railroad |work=BBC News|date=July 13, 2000|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref> It grossed $19.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million, but still continues with its merchandising.\n\nDue to the film's performance, Allcroft was forced to resign from her company in September 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/08/2|title=Britt Allcroft quits as Thomas flops|date=September 8, 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref> [[HIT Entertainment|HiT Entertainment]] acquired the company two years later, including the television rights to ''Thomas''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jul/05/citynews.broadcasting|title=Gullane succumbs to HIT's advances|date=July 5, 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Note: Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should only be 400-700 words long. As of this note, there are 660 words-->\n[[Sir Topham Hatt]] and his family have left the Island of Sodor on holiday, leaving Mr. Conductor, the owner of Shining Time Station, in charge of the engines. Gordon complains to Thomas, when Diesel 10 races by, scaring both engines. Meanwhile, in Shining Time, Mr. Conductor is suffering a crisis; his supply of magic gold dust is alarmingly low and not enough for him to travel back from Sodor. At Tidmouth Sheds, Thomas is talking to James, when Diesel 10 arrives and announces his plan to rid Sodor of steam engines by finding and destroying Lady, the lost engine, the key to steam engines living in peace. Thomas leaves to collect Mr. Conductor. Lady is hidden in a workshop on Muffle Mountain after Diesel 10's previous attempt to destroy her. Lady is unable to steam despite trying all of the coals in Indian Valley. That night, Diesel 10 approaches the shed where the steam engines are sleeping and destroys the side of it with his claw. Mr. Conductor tries to keep him in order, but the gold dust fails and Mr. Conductor scares Diesel 10 away by threatening to pour a bag of sugar in his fuel tanks.\n\nBurnett's granddaughter, Lily Stone, is visiting her grandfather. She meets a dog called Mutt at the railway station. At the sheds, the steam engines express their concerns about diesels to Mr. Conductor, unaware that Diesel 10's oafish diesel minions Splatter and Dodge are spying on them. Lily meets Mr. Conductor's cousin Junior and Stacy Jones before she is taken to Burnett's house. Mr. Conductor calls Junior to help him with his gold dust crisis. While talking at Knapford that night, Percy and Thomas conclude there is a secret railway between Sodor and Shining Time. After spying on their conversation and hearing everything, Diesel 10 goes to the Ironworks to tell Splatter and Dodge of his plans to destroy Lady and the other steam engines. Observing this, Toby distracts Diesel 10 by ringing his bell, causing Diesel 10 to knock one of the supports out from the shed with his claw, which collapses the roof on top of them. The next morning, Thomas collects six coal trucks for Henry, and one of them accidentally rolls through the buffers that lead to the secret railway. Later that day, Mr. Conductor is ambushed by Diesel 10, who scoops him up with his claw and threatens to drop Mr. Conductor off a [[viaduct]] unless he divulges the location of the buffers. Before Diesel 10 can drop him, Mr. Conductor cuts one of the claw's fuel hoses with a pair of [[tin snips]], and is thrown free. He lands at the Sodor [[windmill]], where he finds a clue to the source of the gold dust.\n\nLily meets Patch, who takes her to Shining Time, where she meets Junior again. Junior takes her through the Magic Railroad to Sodor, where they meet Thomas. Thomas is not happy to see Junior, but agrees to help him and Lily and takes them to the Windmill, where they find Mr. Conductor. Junior climbs onto one of the sails and is thrown onto Diesel 10's roof. Later that night, Percy finds that Splatter and Dodge have found the Sodor entrance to the Magic Railroad and goes to warn Thomas. Thomas agrees to take Lily home. While traveling through the Magic Railroad, Thomas discovers the missing coal truck, which he collects. Lily goes to find Burnett, leaving Thomas stranded. Thomas rolls down the mountain and re-enters the Magic Railroad through another secret portal.\n\nLily finds Burnett in his workshop and he explains the problem getting Lady to steam. Lily suggests using a special coal from Sodor. Patch retrieves the truck and Burnett uses the coal to fire Lady. Now steaming, Lady takes Burnett, Lily, Patch and Mutt along the Magic Railroad. Thomas arrives and the two engines return to Sodor, where they meet Mr. Conductor and Junior. Diesel 10 arrives with Splatter and Dodge, who decide to stop helping him. Diesel 10 chases Lady, but Thomas races between them, heading towards the viaduct. Thomas and Lady both make it safely across, but the viaduct collapses under Diesel 10's weight, and he falls and lands onto a [[barge]] filled with [[sludge]].\n\nThomas, Lady and Burnett return to the grotto; Lily combines water from a wishing well and shavings from the Magic Railroad to make more gold dust. Junior decides to go to work on Sodor and Mr. Conductor gives him his conductor's hat before sending him to another railway. Lily, Burnett, Patch and Mutt return to Shining Time, and Lady returns to the Magic Railroad while Thomas travels home into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action===\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Mr. Conductor\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Burnett Stone: Lily's grandfather and Lady's driver.\n** Jared Wall as young Burnett\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Lily Stone: Burnett's granddaughter.\n* [[Michael E.

W. Awdry]]'s ''[[Railway Series]]'' into the TV series ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'', created by [[Britt Allcroft]] \u2013 was at the height of his popularity following three successful series. At the same time, ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' \u2013 an American series that combined episodes from the previous series with original live-action characters and scenarios, also created by Allcroft along with Rick Siggelkow \u2013 was made, and also successful. As early as 1994, prior to the launch of ''Thomas''{{'}}s [[Thomas & Friends (series 4)|fourth series]], Britt Allcroft had plans to make a feature film based on both of these series, and would make use of the model trains from ''Thomas'' and the live-action aesthetic of ''Shining Time Station''.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\" />\n\nIn February 1996, Britt Allcroft was approached by Barry London, then vice-chairman of [[Paramount Pictures]], with an idea for the ''Thomas'' film. Britt signed a contract to write the script for the film with the working title ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad''. London's interest is thought to have stemmed from his three-year-old daughter, who was enthralled by ''Thomas''. According to a press release, filming was to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]], in the United Kingdom and the United States, with the theatrical release date set for 1997. However, later that year, after London left the company, Paramount shelved the plans for the film. This left Allcroft to seek other sources of funding. Discussions with [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram]] about the film were held, but not for long, because of the company being in the middle of a corporate restructuring and sale.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\" />\n\nIn the Summer of 1998, during [[Thomas & Friends (series 5)|Series 5]] of ''Thomas''{{'}}s production, Allcroft saw an Isle of Man Film Commission advert. They were offering tax incentives to companies wanting to film on the Island. Allcroft visited, and felt that the location was perfect. During that year, Barry London became Chairman of the newly founded [[Destination Films]] (owned by [[Sony Pictures]]). He renewed his interest in the project, and Destination Films became the main financial backer and studio for the film.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\">{{cite web|title=SiF: About the Magic Railroad|url=http://www.sodor-island.net/themagicrailroadminisite/aboutthemagicrailroad.html|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nJohn Bellis was originally attached to voice Thomas, but was replaced by Canadian actor [[Edward Glen]]. [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Bob Hoskins]] had also expressed interest for the role.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/hollywood-vetoes-liverpool-accent-as-voice-of-thomas-the-tank-engine-loses-his-liverpool-voice-282054.html|title=Hollywood vetoes Liverpool accent as voice of Thomas the Tank Engine|date=April 29, 2000|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref> [[Michael Angelis]] was original cast to voice James and Percy, but was later replaced by voice actresses [[Susan Roman]] and [[Linda Ballantyne]]. [[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]] was originally planned to voice Diesel 10, but was later replaced by [[Neil Crone]] in the final film. [[Patrick Breen]] was originally set to voice both Splatter and Dodge, but was eventually replaced by both [[Kevin Frank]] and [[Neil Crone]].\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 2, 1999, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 15 of that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1999-08-30-3261686-story.html|title=ROLLING ALONG NEW ADVENTURES FOR THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE|website=mcall.com}}</ref> The movie was filmed at the [[Strasburg Rail Road]] in [[Strasburg, Pennsylvania]] (United States), as well as in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and on the [[Isle of Man]]. [[Castletown railway station]] on the [[Isle of Man Railway]] formed part of Shining Time Station and the [[goods shed]] at [[Port St Mary railway station]] became Burnett Stone's workshop. Running shots of the \"[[Indian Valley Railroad|Indian Valley]]\" train were filmed at the Strasburg Rail Road location. The large passenger station where Lily boards the train is the [[Harrisburg Transportation Center]].  [[Norfolk & Western]] [[4-8-0 475|4-8-0 '''475''']] was repainted as the Indian Valley locomotive. Sodor was realised using models and [[chroma key]]. The models were animated using live action remote control, as on the [[television series]]. The model sequences were filmed in Toronto instead of Shepperton Studios, the \"home\" of the original TV show; however, several of the show's key staff were flown over to participate. The Magic Railway was created using models, [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and water-coloured [[matte painting]]s.\n\n===Original version===\nIn a 2007 interview, director Britt Allcroft revealed that the theatrical release was drastically changed from what it was originally going to be the way she had written it, with original antagonist P.T. Boomer (played by [[Doug Lennox]]) being removed from the film because audiences at the Los Angeles preview screenings considered the character too scary for young children.<ref name=Revealed>{{cite web|url=http://www.sodor-island.net/themagicrailroadminisite/mrrevealed.html |title=Magic Railroad \u2013 Revealed |website=Sodor-island.net |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n\nLily Stone (played by [[Mara Wilson]]) was intended to be the narrator of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sodor-island.net/themagicrailroadminisite/brittallcroftmagicrailroad.html |title=Interview: Britt Allcroft - Producer |website=Sodor-island.net |date=May 19, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref> Before filming, Thomas's voice was provided by John Bellis, a fireman and part-time taxi driver who worked on the film as the Isle of Man transportation co-ordinator and facilities manager. Bellis received the role when he happened to pick up Britt Allcroft and her crew from the airport. According to Allcroft, after hearing him speak for the first time, she told her colleagues, \"I have just heard the voice of Thomas. That man is exactly how Thomas would sound!\" Bellis accepted the role.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/396351.stm | work=BBC News | title=Thomas finds his voice | date=July 16, 1998}}</ref> However, after audiences did not react positively to his voice for Thomas, Bellis was replaced by [[Edward Glen]].\n\nBellis received a credit for his work on the Isle of Man, and his voice can still be heard extensively in one or two of the trailers. Bellis said he was \"gutted\", but wished the film-makers well. \"It was supposed to be my big break, but it hasn't put me off and I am hoping something else will come along.\" [[Michael Angelis]], the UK narrator for the ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'' television series for 21 years (1991\u20132012), was originally cast as the voices of both James and Percy, but the audiences considered his voice too old for the characters, who were subsequently recast with [[Susan Roman]] and [[Linda Ballantyne]] respectively.

The film stars [[Alec Baldwin]] as Mr. Conductor, [[Peter Fonda]], [[Mara Wilson]], [[Didi Conn]], [[Russell Means]], [[Cody McMains]], [[Michael E. Rodgers]], and [[Edward Glen|Eddie Glen]] as the voice of Thomas. The film is based on the British children's book series ''[[The Railway Series]]'' by [[Wilbert Awdry|The Rev. W. Awdry]], its televised adaptation ''[[Thomas & Friends|Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'', and the American television series ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' by Britt Allcroft and Rick Siggelkow.\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[Gullane Entertainment|Gullane Pictures]] and the [[Isle of Man Film|Isle of Man Film Commission]]. It was distributed by [[Destination Films]] in the [[United States]], [[Icon Productions|Icon Film Distribution]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and [[ABC Films]] in [[Australia]]. The film tells the story of Lily Stone, the granddaughter of the caretaker of an enchanted [[steam engine]] who is lacking an appropriate supply of coal, and Mr. Conductor of Shining Time Station, whose provisions of magical gold dust are at a critical low. To ameliorate these problems, Lily and Mr. Conductor enlist the help of [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]], who confronts the ruthless and devious [[Diesel 10]] who plans to get rid of the railway's steam engines along the way.\n\nPlans for an original ''Thomas & Friends'' film started with [[Paramount Pictures]], but did not pull through. Shortly afterward, [[Destination Films]] began funding for the film and started production in 1998.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\" /> Filming took place at the Strasburg Railroad, Toronto, Canada, and the Isle of Man. It held its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in the United Kingdom on July 9, 2000. The film was reviewed negatively by critics, mainly from the US upon release, with criticism directed towards the acting, plot, special effects, and lack of fidelity towards the source material.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Thomson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2000/07/13/thomas_magic_railroad_review.shtml |title=Films - review - Thomas and the Magic Railroad |work=BBC News|date=July 13, 2000|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref> It grossed $19.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million, but still continues with its merchandising.\n\nDue to the film's performance, Allcroft was forced to resign from her company in September 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/08/2|title=Britt Allcroft quits as Thomas flops|date=September 8, 2000|work=The Guardian|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref> [[HIT Entertainment|HiT Entertainment]] acquired the company two years later, including the television rights to ''Thomas''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/jul/05/citynews.broadcasting|title=Gullane succumbs to HIT's advances|date=July 5, 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Note: Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should only be 400-700 words long. As of this note, there are 660 words-->\n[[Sir Topham Hatt]] and his family have left the Island of Sodor on holiday, leaving Mr. Conductor, the owner of Shining Time Station, in charge of the engines. Gordon complains to Thomas, when Diesel 10 races by, scaring both engines. Meanwhile, in Shining Time, Mr. Conductor is suffering a crisis; his supply of magic gold dust is alarmingly low and not enough for him to travel back from Sodor. At Tidmouth Sheds, Thomas is talking to James, when Diesel 10 arrives and announces his plan to rid Sodor of steam engines by finding and destroying Lady, the lost engine, the key to steam engines living in peace. Thomas leaves to collect Mr. Conductor. Lady is hidden in a workshop on Muffle Mountain after Diesel 10's previous attempt to destroy her. Lady is unable to steam despite trying all of the coals in Indian Valley. That night, Diesel 10 approaches the shed where the steam engines are sleeping and destroys the side of it with his claw. Mr. Conductor tries to keep him in order, but the gold dust fails and Mr. Conductor scares Diesel 10 away by threatening to pour a bag of sugar in his fuel tanks.\n\nBurnett's granddaughter, Lily Stone, is visiting her grandfather. She meets a dog called Mutt at the railway station. At the sheds, the steam engines express their concerns about diesels to Mr. Conductor, unaware that Diesel 10's oafish diesel minions Splatter and Dodge are spying on them. Lily meets Mr. Conductor's cousin Junior and Stacy Jones before she is taken to Burnett's house. Mr. Conductor calls Junior to help him with his gold dust crisis. While talking at Knapford that night, Percy and Thomas conclude there is a secret railway between Sodor and Shining Time. After spying on their conversation and hearing everything, Diesel 10 goes to the Ironworks to tell Splatter and Dodge of his plans to destroy Lady and the other steam engines. Observing this, Toby distracts Diesel 10 by ringing his bell, causing Diesel 10 to knock one of the supports out from the shed with his claw, which collapses the roof on top of them. The next morning, Thomas collects six coal trucks for Henry, and one of them accidentally rolls through the buffers that lead to the secret railway. Later that day, Mr. Conductor is ambushed by Diesel 10, who scoops him up with his claw and threatens to drop Mr. Conductor off a [[viaduct]] unless he divulges the location of the buffers. Before Diesel 10 can drop him, Mr. Conductor cuts one of the claw's fuel hoses with a pair of [[tin snips]], and is thrown free. He lands at the Sodor [[windmill]], where he finds a clue to the source of the gold dust.\n\nLily meets Patch, who takes her to Shining Time, where she meets Junior again. Junior takes her through the Magic Railroad to Sodor, where they meet Thomas. Thomas is not happy to see Junior, but agrees to help him and Lily and takes them to the Windmill, where they find Mr. Conductor. Junior climbs onto one of the sails and is thrown onto Diesel 10's roof. Later that night, Percy finds that Splatter and Dodge have found the Sodor entrance to the Magic Railroad and goes to warn Thomas. Thomas agrees to take Lily home. While traveling through the Magic Railroad, Thomas discovers the missing coal truck, which he collects. Lily goes to find Burnett, leaving Thomas stranded. Thomas rolls down the mountain and re-enters the Magic Railroad through another secret portal.\n\nLily finds Burnett in his workshop and he explains the problem getting Lady to steam. Lily suggests using a special coal from Sodor. Patch retrieves the truck and Burnett uses the coal to fire Lady. Now steaming, Lady takes Burnett, Lily, Patch and Mutt along the Magic Railroad. Thomas arrives and the two engines return to Sodor, where they meet Mr. Conductor and Junior. Diesel 10 arrives with Splatter and Dodge, who decide to stop helping him. Diesel 10 chases Lady, but Thomas races between them, heading towards the viaduct. Thomas and Lady both make it safely across, but the viaduct collapses under Diesel 10's weight, and he falls and lands onto a [[barge]] filled with [[sludge]].\n\nThomas, Lady and Burnett return to the grotto; Lily combines water from a wishing well and shavings from the Magic Railroad to make more gold dust. Junior decides to go to work on Sodor and Mr. Conductor gives him his conductor's hat before sending him to another railway. Lily, Burnett, Patch and Mutt return to Shining Time, and Lady returns to the Magic Railroad while Thomas travels home into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action===\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Mr. Conductor\n* [[Peter Fonda]] as Burnett Stone: Lily's grandfather and Lady's driver.\n** Jared Wall as young Burnett\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as Lily Stone: Burnett's granddaughter.\n* [[Michael E.

W. Awdry]]'s ''[[Railway Series]]'' into the TV series ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'', created by [[Britt Allcroft]] \u2013 was at the height of his popularity following three successful series. At the same time, ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' \u2013 an American series that combined episodes from the previous series with original live-action characters and scenarios, also created by Allcroft along with Rick Siggelkow \u2013 was made, and also successful. As early as 1994, prior to the launch of ''Thomas''{{'}}s [[Thomas & Friends (series 4)|fourth series]], Britt Allcroft had plans to make a feature film based on both of these series, and would make use of the model trains from ''Thomas'' and the live-action aesthetic of ''Shining Time Station''.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\" />\n\nIn February 1996, Britt Allcroft was approached by Barry London, then vice-chairman of [[Paramount Pictures]], with an idea for the ''Thomas'' film. Britt signed a contract to write the script for the film with the working title ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad''. London's interest is thought to have stemmed from his three-year-old daughter, who was enthralled by ''Thomas''. According to a press release, filming was to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]], in the United Kingdom and the United States, with the theatrical release date set for 1997. However, later that year, after London left the company, Paramount shelved the plans for the film. This left Allcroft to seek other sources of funding. Discussions with [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment|PolyGram]] about the film were held, but not for long, because of the company being in the middle of a corporate restructuring and sale.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\" />\n\nIn the Summer of 1998, during [[Thomas & Friends (series 5)|Series 5]] of ''Thomas''{{'}}s production, Allcroft saw an Isle of Man Film Commission advert. They were offering tax incentives to companies wanting to film on the Island. Allcroft visited, and felt that the location was perfect. During that year, Barry London became Chairman of the newly founded [[Destination Films]] (owned by [[Sony Pictures]]). He renewed his interest in the project, and Destination Films became the main financial backer and studio for the film.<ref name=\"SiF About the Magic Railroad\">{{cite web|title=SiF: About the Magic Railroad|url=http://www.sodor-island.net/themagicrailroadminisite/aboutthemagicrailroad.html|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nJohn Bellis was originally attached to voice Thomas, but was replaced by Canadian actor [[Edward Glen]].

[[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]] was originally planned to voice Diesel 10, but was later replaced by [[Neil Crone]] in the final film. [[Patrick Breen]] was originally set to voice both Splatter and Dodge, but was eventually replaced by both [[Kevin Frank]] and [[Neil Crone]].\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 2, 1999, and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 15 of that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1999-08-30-3261686-story.html|title=ROLLING ALONG NEW ADVENTURES FOR THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE|website=mcall.com}}</ref> The movie was filmed at the [[Strasburg Rail Road]] in [[Strasburg, Pennsylvania]] (United States), as well as in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada and on the [[Isle of Man]]. [[Castletown railway station]] on the [[Isle of Man Railway]] formed part of Shining Time Station and the [[goods shed]] at [[Port St Mary railway station]] became Burnett Stone's workshop. Running shots of the \"[[Indian Valley Railroad|Indian Valley]]\" train were filmed at the Strasburg Rail Road location. The large passenger station where Lily boards the train is the [[Harrisburg Transportation Center]].  [[Norfolk & Western]] [[4-8-0 475|4-8-0 '''475''']] was repainted as the Indian Valley locomotive. Sodor was realised using models and [[chroma key]]. The models were animated using live action remote control, as on the [[television series]]. The model sequences were filmed in Toronto instead of Shepperton Studios, the \"home\" of the original TV show; however, several of the show's key staff were flown over to participate. The Magic Railway was created using models, [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and water-coloured [[matte painting]]s.\n\n===Original version===\nIn a 2007 interview, director Britt Allcroft revealed that the theatrical release was drastically changed from what it was originally going to be the way she had written it, with original antagonist P.T. Boomer (played by [[Doug Lennox]]) being removed from the film because audiences at the Los Angeles preview screenings considered the character too scary for young children.<ref name=Revealed>{{cite web|url=http://www.sodor-island.net/themagicrailroadminisite/mrrevealed.html |title=Magic Railroad \u2013 Revealed |website=Sodor-island.net |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n\nLily Stone (played by [[Mara Wilson]]) was intended to be the narrator of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sodor-island.net/themagicrailroadminisite/brittallcroftmagicrailroad.html |title=Interview: Britt Allcroft - Producer |website=Sodor-island.net |date=May 19, 1999 |accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref> Before filming, Thomas's voice was provided by John Bellis, a fireman and part-time taxi driver who worked on the film as the Isle of Man transportation co-ordinator and facilities manager. Bellis received the role when he happened to pick up Britt Allcroft and her crew from the airport. According to Allcroft, after hearing him speak for the first time, she told her colleagues, \"I have just heard the voice of Thomas.

[[congressional district]] for the [[United States House of Representatives]] represented by [[Eliot Engel]].\n\nThe 16th district includes the northern [[Bronx]] and the southern half of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], including the suburban cities of [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], and [[Rye, New York|Rye]].\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, the district included the neighborhoods of [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]], [[East Tremont, Bronx|East Tremont]], [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]], [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], [[Morrisania, Bronx|Morrisania]], [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]] and [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]].  [[Yankee Stadium]], [[Fordham University]] and the [[Bronx Zoo]] were located within the district. Before [[redistricting]], the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] found that approximately 38% of constituents in New York's 16th [[Poverty in the United States|lived at or below the federal poverty line]], the highest poverty rate of any congressional district in the nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/south-bronx-poorest-district-nation-u-s-census-bureau-finds-38-live-poverty-line-article-1.438344|title=South Bronx is poorest district in nation, U.S. Census Bureau finds: 38% live below poverty line|last=Sisk|first=Richard|date=September 29, 2010|work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> These neighborhoods were largely reassigned to the [[New York's 15th congressional district|15th district]] after redistricting, while the current 16th comprises most of the territory that had previously been the 17th District.  The current 16th district, while still containing impoverished areas, such as some neighborhoods of [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], also contains affluent areas, such as in [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]] and [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]], resulting in a more mixed-income demography.\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], the previous version of this district gave [[Barack Obama]] his largest victory margin of any congressional district, a margin of 90% (95%-5%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4161|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305175409/http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4161|url-status=dead|title=Swing State Project|archivedate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> The current configuration of the 16th district is not as overwhelmingly Democratic as the previous version, but retains a Democratic majority.\n\n== Election results from presidential races ==\n{| class=wikitable\n!

Nelson began his presidency two days after his ordination with a short broadcast to church members in January 2018 before then holding a press conference.  This broadcast ahead of the press conference was unprecedented and provided the new leaders an opportunity to briefly address the entire church immediately.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng report on Nelson's broadcast to the Church]</ref> \n\nIn March 2018, the First Presidency issued a letter on preventing and responding to abuse. This letter reiterated existing policies, but also explicitly stated that no one should ever be counseled against reporting abuse to legal authorities. The guidance also had a clear emphasis on using counseling to assist in healing from abuse. It also provided more clear policies mandating all interviews with women and youth be done with another person in the general area, and made it clear that youth and women could have a parent or other adult present for an interview. It also adjusted previous policies forbidding adult males to teach classes of children or youth alone to apply to all adults.<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-encourages-leaders-worldwide-prevent-respond-abuse report on March first presidency letter]</ref>\n\nDuring the church's April general conference, Nelson announced the appointment of Asian-American [[Gerrit W. Gong]] and Brazilian [[Ulisses Soares]] to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, both of whom had been serving in the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]]. By most measures, Gong was the first apostle who was not white, although some also consider Soares as non-white. These calls were recognized as adding diversity to the Quorum of the Twelve.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014460/twitter-reacts-to-lds-church-naming-new-apostles-elder-gong-and-elder-soares.html article about new apostles]</ref> \n\nNelson also announced major changes in church organization during the April general conference. First, the high priests groups at the ward level were dissolved, making all Melchizedek Priesthood holders in wards and branches part of the elders quorum.  A stake's high priest quorum now consists of current members of stake presidencies, high councils, bishoprics and functioning patriarchs. Next, Nelson announced the end of home teaching and visiting teaching, replacing the programs with a focus on ministering, and shifting both the focus and methods of tracking them. As part of this change, young women ages 14-18 may be assigned as ministering sisters, similar to the-long standing policies of young men ages 14-18 serving as home teachers.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/04/01/the-latest-from-final-day-of-mormon-general-conference-easter-greetings-plea-to-be-worthy-of-gods-guidance/ article on announcements at general conference]</ref> At the end of the conference Nelson announced the construction of seven new temples, including the first in Nicaragua, Russia, India, and the US state of Virginia.\n\nIn May 2018, the church announced it would end its sponsorship of scouting troops at the end of 2019. As part of this decision, it was stated that all Young Men, Young Women, and Primary programs for those age 8-18 would be replaced by a new, unified worldwide program.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/05/09/mormon-church-to-cut-ties-with-boy-scouts-and-start-its-own-gospel-driven-youth-program/ article on LDS Church ending scouting, announcing new youth program]</ref>\n\nJune 2018 began with a First Presidency-sponsored celebration of the 40th anniversary of the revelation extending [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] blessing to all worthy members without regard to race, in which Nelson gave concluding remarks.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900020359/church-news-president-nelsons-full-remarks-from-the-lds-churchs-be-one-celebration.html article on Nelson's statement at meeting]</ref> A few days before this, Nelson and his counselors met with the national leaders of the [[NAACP]].<ref>[http://fox13now.com/2018/05/17/watch-live-lds-church-first-presidency-and-naacp-making-joint-statement/ article on Nelson meeting with NAACP leadership]</ref> That same weekend Nelson gave a devotional to Latter-day Saint youth in which he urged them to more fully commit to the church.

As of October 2019, Nelson has announced a total of 35 new temples to be built in several countries around the world. His travels have been punctuated by several temple dedications, most notably the [[Rome Italy Temple]] in March 2019, which was attended by all current members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn 2018, Nelson announced 19 new temples, 7 in April and 12 in October, among which were the first in [[India]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Russia]], and [[Cambodia]].

Nelson began his presidency two days after his ordination with a short broadcast to church members in January 2018 before then holding a press conference.  This broadcast ahead of the press conference was unprecedented and provided the new leaders an opportunity to briefly address the entire church immediately.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng report on Nelson's broadcast to the Church]</ref> \n\nIn March 2018, the First Presidency issued a letter on preventing and responding to abuse. This letter reiterated existing policies, but also explicitly stated that no one should ever be counseled against reporting abuse to legal authorities. The guidance also had a clear emphasis on using counseling to assist in healing from abuse. It also provided more clear policies mandating all interviews with women and youth be done with another person in the general area, and made it clear that youth and women could have a parent or other adult present for an interview. It also adjusted previous policies forbidding adult males to teach classes of children or youth alone to apply to all adults.<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-encourages-leaders-worldwide-prevent-respond-abuse report on March first presidency letter]</ref>\n\nDuring the church's April general conference, Nelson announced the appointment of Asian-American [[Gerrit W. Gong]] and Brazilian [[Ulisses Soares]] to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, both of whom had been serving in the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]]. By most measures, Gong was the first apostle who was not white, although some also consider Soares as non-white. These calls were recognized as adding diversity to the Quorum of the Twelve.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014460/twitter-reacts-to-lds-church-naming-new-apostles-elder-gong-and-elder-soares.html article about new apostles]</ref> \n\nNelson also announced major changes in church organization during the April general conference. First, the high priests groups at the ward level were dissolved, making all Melchizedek Priesthood holders in wards and branches part of the elders quorum.  A stake's high priest quorum now consists of current members of stake presidencies, high councils, bishoprics and functioning patriarchs. Next, Nelson announced the end of home teaching and visiting teaching, replacing the programs with a focus on ministering, and shifting both the focus and methods of tracking them. As part of this change, young women ages 14-18 may be assigned as ministering sisters, similar to the-long standing policies of young men ages 14-18 serving as home teachers.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/04/01/the-latest-from-final-day-of-mormon-general-conference-easter-greetings-plea-to-be-worthy-of-gods-guidance/ article on announcements at general conference]</ref> At the end of the conference Nelson announced the construction of seven new temples, including the first in Nicaragua, Russia, India, and the US state of Virginia.\n\nIn May 2018, the church announced it would end its sponsorship of scouting troops at the end of 2019. As part of this decision, it was stated that all Young Men, Young Women, and Primary programs for those age 8-18 would be replaced by a new, unified worldwide program.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/05/09/mormon-church-to-cut-ties-with-boy-scouts-and-start-its-own-gospel-driven-youth-program/ article on LDS Church ending scouting, announcing new youth program]</ref>\n\nJune 2018 began with a First Presidency-sponsored celebration of the 40th anniversary of the revelation extending [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] blessing to all worthy members without regard to race, in which Nelson gave concluding remarks.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900020359/church-news-president-nelsons-full-remarks-from-the-lds-churchs-be-one-celebration.html article on Nelson's statement at meeting]</ref> A few days before this, Nelson and his counselors met with the national leaders of the [[NAACP]].<ref>[http://fox13now.com/2018/05/17/watch-live-lds-church-first-presidency-and-naacp-making-joint-statement/ article on Nelson meeting with NAACP leadership]</ref> That same weekend Nelson gave a devotional to LDS youth in which he urged them to more fully commit to the church.

For his secondary education, he attended [[Batu Pahat High School]] and [[Malacca High School]]. He graduated from [[Monash University]] in Australia with a [[Bachelor of Economics]] (BEc). He also served as the president of MUISS (Monash University International Student Society) during his university years.\n\n==Political career==\nPrior to his political career, Lim was a senior executive at a bank.<ref name=\"dapmalaysia1\"/> He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Kota Melaka in 1986, defeating [[Soh Chin Aun]] with a majority of 17,606 votes. He was re-elected in the 1990 and 1995 general elections, albeit with reduced majorities. He thus became the first person to be elected to three consecutive terms in Kota Melaka. He was also the first [[Malacca High School]] alumnus to achieve this.\n\nIn October 1987, he was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] in [[Operation Lalang]], along with 106 other politicians and activists. He was released in April 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2012/10/28/guan-eng-calls-for-apology-on-ops-lalang-anniversary/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125202159/http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2012/10/28/guan-eng-calls-for-apology-on-ops-lalang-anniversary/ |archivedate=25 January 2013 }}</ref> He was the first person to be detained and the last to be released during Operation Lalang.\n\nHe was appointed the DAP Socialist Youth chairman in 1989 and was formally elected to that post in 1992. In 1995, he was elected the DAP Deputy Secretary-General. He was elected the party's Secretary-General in 2004, and has held that position since.\n\n===Jailed under Sedition Act===\nLim was arrested by the Malaysian police in 1994, following his criticism of the government's failure to bring the then-Chief Minister of [[Melaka]], Tan Sri Abdul [[Rahim Thamby Chik]]'s statutory rape case to trial when the [[Attorney General]] had decided not to press charges. Lim was charged under Section 4(1) (b) of the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act 1948]] for causing 'disaffection with the administration of justice in Malaysia'. He was also charged under Section 8A (1) of the [[Printing Presses and Publications Act|Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984]] for 'maliciously printing' a pamphlet containing allegedly 'false information' which supposedly described the alleged rape victim as an 'imprisoned victim' because she was initially detained by Malaysian police without parental consent for 10 days. During the judicial procedure, Lim was quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|If I fail and have to go to jail, I have no regrets. I have no regrets of going down fighting for the principles of truth and justice and pursuit of human rights, especially women's rights. There can be no women's rights if female rape victims are considered equally responsible, and even detained, whilst the accused remain free. |Lim Guan Eng<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/heureka/sunrise/lim-guan.htm |title=The Trial of Lim Guan Eng |website=Home.clara.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-02}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter a series of appeals, Lim was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He was, however, released after 12 months on 25 August 1999. Due to his incarceration, he was barred from standing for election to public office for a period of 5 years, and he was therefore ineligible to contest in the [[2004 Malaysian general election|2004 Malaysian General Election]].\n\n===Internal bickering===\nIn 2005, Lim suffered a surprise defeat in his campaign for re-election to the Malacca DAP committee. However, as Lim remained Secretary-General of the party, he was automatically included in the committee in accordance with the party's constitution.

For his secondary education, he attended [[Batu Pahat High School]] and [[Malacca High School]]. He graduated from [[Monash University]] in Australia with a [[Bachelor of Economics]] (BEc). He also served as the president of MUISS (Monash University International Student Society) during his university years.\n\n==Political career==\nPrior to his political career, Lim was a senior executive at a bank.<ref name=\"dapmalaysia1\"/> He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Kota Melaka in 1986, defeating [[Soh Chin Aun]] with a majority of 17,606 votes. He was re-elected in the 1990 and 1995 general elections, albeit with reduced majorities. He thus became the first person to be elected to three consecutive terms in Kota Melaka. He was also the first [[Malacca High School]] alumnus to achieve this.\n\nIn October 1987, he was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] in [[Operation Lalang]], along with 106 other politicians and activists.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967. Called \"Operation Luciver\", ex-gendarmes  crossed from Angola to Katanga and occupied Kisenge and Mutshatsha before being defeated by the ANC. In the Congo, reprisal raids against former gendarmes then occurred; the ANC killed several leaders of the gendarmes.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78,84}} \n\n== Later history (1967-present) ==\n{{Further|Congolese National Liberation Front}}{{Quote box\n| quote = \"we cannot by any means support a political and military adventure in Katanga without it being useful to our own policy. . . .

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).

There had also been ongoing efforts by the United Nations to suppress Belgian support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August.

UMHK officials privately told Tshombe they were withdrawing their support for succession.<ref name=\"othen\" /> General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of Kolwezi. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline in the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} He offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties from Operation Grandslam are unknown. Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Moke and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000-17,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000-3,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967.

A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]]  Background=\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]], which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something.

We can say that the majority of the Bosnian territory was probably occupied by Croats \u2013 or at least, by Slavs under Croat rule \u2013 in the seventh century; but that is a tribal label which has little or no meaning five centuries later. The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism.

The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism.
