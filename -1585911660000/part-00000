Due to the city's expansion the observatory moved to [[Bickley, Western Australia|Bickley]] in 1965. The new Perth Observatory is sometimes referred to as Bickley Observatory (obs. code [[IAU code#322|322]], [[IAU code#323|323]]).<ref name=\"springer\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Perth Observatory.jpg|thumb|left|Old Perth Observatory at [[Mount Eliza (Western Australia)|Mount Eliza]]. Now home to the WA branch of the [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]].]]\n[[File:Perth Observatory staff-1900.jpg|left|thumb|Observatory staff, c.1900. The first Government Astronomer, [[William Ernest Cooke|W. Ernest Cooke]] is seated at the left. His successor [[Harold Curlewis]], is standing in the light coloured suit.]]\n\n===First Perth Observatory===\nThe original Perth Observatory was constructed in 1896 and was officially opened in 1900 by [[John Forrest]], the first [[premier of Western Australia]]. The observatory was located at [[Mount Eliza, Western Australia|Mount Eliza]] overlooking the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. Its chief roles were keeping [[Standard Time]] for Western Australia and meteorological data collection.\n\n===<abbr title=\"Western Australian\">WA</abbr> Government Astronomers===\n====William Ernest Cooke====\n\n[[William Ernest Cooke]] was appointed the first [[Western Australian Government Astronomer]] in 1896 after a similar posting at the [[Adelaide Observatory]]. On arrival in Perth, his first task was to determine the exact latitude and longitude of the colony. He was also able to determine the time of day with greater accuracy. Before his arrival clocks could vary by up to half an hour. The [[Time signal|time]] was announced each day by a cannon still present on the grounds. The design was by the government architect, [[George Temple-Poole]], and features a bold combination of [[Australian architectural styles|styles]].\n\n====Harold Burnham Curlewis====\nCooke's successor as [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] was [[Harold Curlewis]] who wrote in 1929:\n<blockquote>Since the prevailing winds blow over the huge extent of King's Park, its excellence for astronomical work is not impaired by its proximity to the city, as is so often the case with other observatories. ...A glance from the tower, from which a wonderful panorama of Perth may be obtained, shows that no growth of the city can ever adversely affect observing conditions<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Civil Service Journal|date=20 July 1929|title=The Perth Observatory|pages=73\u201374|author=H B Curlewis}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=====Curlewis and the WA border=====\n{{see also|Western Australia border}}\n\nIn 1920 and 1921 Curlewis was involved with the [[South Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer of South Australia]], Dodwell, in determinations to fix positions for marking of the [[Western Australia border|West Australian border]] on the ground with the [[South Australian borders|South Australian border]] at [[Deakin, Western Australia]]. In 1921 the same group from the Deakin determinations travelled by the State Ship, MV ''Bambra'' to Wyndham, where they were guided by [[Michael Durack|M.P. Durack]] to a point on Rosewood station near [[Argyle Downs]] close to the [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]] (<abbr title=\"129th meridian east longitude\">129\u00b0 east</abbr>). They used the relatively new technology of the day, wireless radio time signals, and other methods to fix a position for the [[Northern Territory borders|Northern Territory border]] with Western Australia.<ref name=\"notstraight\" />\n\nThese early determinations led to the 1968 agreement for the formation of [[Surveyor Generals Corner]].\n\nThe WA border is not straight ''(see [[Western Australia border]])''; at the [[26th parallel south]] (<abbr title=\"26th parallel south latitude\">26\u00b0 south</abbr>) there is an approximately 127 metre \"sideways\" section of the <abbr title=\"Western Australian\">WA</abbr>/<abbr title=\"Northern Territory\">NT</abbr> border, which runs east-west.<ref name=\"notstraight\" />\n\n====Hyman Solomon Spigl====\nCurlewis's successor as [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] was Hyman Solomon Spigl between 1940 and 1962. Spigl, who was from a surveying background, progressed rebuilding a post war ravaged Observatory by rejuvenating the time service, seismology services, completing the Astrographic Catalogues, became involved in the [[International Geophysical Year]] by installing a Markowitz Moon camera and restarted the publications for the Royal Astronomical Society. Additionally, through a National Science Foundation of America grant, he was in the process of refurbishing the Observatory's 6-inch meridian transit circle to recommence meridian observations. While he never achieved this before his death, and it was never used again, the instrument sits in the foyer of the Perth Observatory now fully refurbished.\n\nIn 1958 Spigl was awarded a [[Robert Gledden|Gledden]] Travelling Fellowship by the [[University of Western Australia]]; Spigl spent 12 months travelling in the US, UK and Europe. Spigl was actively searching for a new site for the Perth Observatory as a result of the decision for it to be relocated as an outcome of the implementation of the 1955 [[Metropolitan Region Scheme|Stephenson-Hepburn Report]]. Spigl spent many years lecturing in surveying at the University of Western Australia and was involved in the Astronomical Society of Western Australia.\n\n====John Bertrand Harris====\nUpon the death of Spigl on 20 August 1962, John Bertrand Harris, who had been Spigl's assistant since 1957, became the fourth [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] of the Perth Observatory between 1962 until the end of 1974.<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/harris-bertrand-john-10433 | title=Australian Dictionary of Biography| chapter=Harris, Bertrand John (1925\u20131974)| publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University}}</ref> Harris had to step in to the position of Government Astronomer at a time when the Perth Observatory was on the move to its new site in the Darling Range, [[Bickley, Western Australia|Bickley]], some 24&nbsp;km east of its original position in the City of [[Perth]]. Clearing of the land in the State Forrest in Bickely commenced in February 1964, with excavations commencing in May 1964 and construction works on buildings continuing through 1965; staff moved in on 19 December 1965.\n\nWith the new Bickely site complete, in 1967, Harris oversaw the installation of a [[meridian circle]] telescope at the Observatory as part of an expedition by [[astronomer]]s from the Hamburg Observatory in Germany. The expedition worked on the international Southern Reference Stars program that resulted in a revised, larger and more accurate meridian catalogue of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]: the Perth 70 meridian catalogue. In 1970 Harris was successful in forming a dedicated Perth Observatory Meridian section to assist the German expedition in their work. After the German expedition left over the 1971/72 Christmas/New Year period, Harris successfully negotiated the loan of the Hamburg telescope indefinitely and obtained funding from the [[Government of Western Australia]] to increase the Meridian staff numbers. This Perth Observatory Meridian team continued and expanded on the German expedition work, resulting in the Perth 75 meridian catalogue.\n\nIn 1967, Harris worked with the [[University of Western Australia]] to install a 16-inch telescope at the Observatory that was built and used by the University of Western Australia staff and students, as well as Perth Observatory astronomers.\n\nHarris then moved the astrographic telescope, which had been in storage since August 1963, to the new site after arranging its refurbishment; the telescope recommenced observations on 29 March 1968, taking second [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] photographic plates for [[proper motion]] studies.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Lowell Observatory]] of Flagstaff Arizona USA, located a 24-inch [[Boller and Chivens]] telescope at the Perth Observatory as part of the [[International Planetary Patrol Program]]. The program was designed to collect 35mm photographic data on the atmospheric and surface features of Solar System planets, mostly Mars, Jupiter and Venus; Harris was to be a regular observer outside his normal daytime Government Astronomer role.\n\nHarris was successful in increasing the technical and astronomical staff numbers at the new Bickley Perth Observatory as its role moved to that of more of a scientific function, however Harris also restarted the public tours on 23 October 1966 and maintained the provision of information services to Western Australia. Harris also continued [[Standard time|time]] and [[tide]] services for Western Australia, however as had been the case in 1908 for Meteorology, the move saw [[seismic]] monitoring activities being relocated to Mundaring under the Commonwealth Government control.\n\nHarris was responsible for the August 1973 [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] Symposium No. 61 in Perth on \"New Problems of Astrometry\". Like his predecessor, he died at an early age, 49, but had raised the standing of the Perth Observatory to a well respected scientific institution within Australia and internationally.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n====Dr Iwan (Ivan) Nikoloff====\nWith the death of Harris on 23 December 1974, Nikoloff was to act in the role of [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] of the Perth Observatory until 30 May 1979 when he officially became the fifth Government Astronomer of the Perth Observatory.\n\nAfter arriving in Australia in 1964, he commenced at the Perth Observatory as an Astronomer Grade II on 1 May 1964 and worked on the Observatory's [[astrograph]]; his previous experience also saw him set up and calibrate the recently acquired Zeiss plate measuring machine. With the relocation of the Perth Observatory from Perth to Bickley, Nikoloff's surveying skills were extensively used in setting up the new Observatory during 1965.\n\nNikoloff worked with the German Hamburg Observatory [[meridian circle]] telescope expedition on the Perth 70 catalogue, from 1969 until 1971, before the expedition [[astronomer]]s returned to Germany that Christmas.\n\nIn 1971, with funding by the [[Government of Western Australia]] and negotiations for the loan of the Hamburg telescope, Nikoloff was placed in charge of the newly formed Perth Observatory Meridian Section. Dr Nikoloff commenced a new observing program of FK4 and FK4 Supplementary stars that would result in the Perth 75 catalogue of 2549 stars. The catalogue not only extended the well revered Perth 70 catalogue, but provided valuable [[Southern Hemisphere]] information for the construction of the new FK5 reference frame sought by the international astronomical community.\n\nAs Government Astronomer, Nikoloff passed on the Meridian Section to D. Harwood, but kept a keen involvement in the construction of the subsequent Perth 83 meridian catalogue. While daily administrative duties kept him busy, Nikoloff continued observing on all the Observatory's telescopes at night and on weekends.\n\nNikoloff maintained a good relationship with the [[University of Western Australia]], was a Foundation member and Fellow of the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]], a life member of the Astronomical Association of Western Australia and a member of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s original Commission 8 (Astrometry) and I (Fundamental Astronomy); he also continued the Observatory's public information services and tours. He retired on 4 January 1985 and died on 8 April 2015.\n\n===Perth Observatory Directors===\nUpon the retirement of Dr I Nikoloff, the governing body of the Perth Observatory at that time, the [[Department of Science and Technology (Australia)]], replaced the primary title of what was previously called the [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]], with the title of [[Director (business)|Director]] Perth Observatory. The reason given was that the title of [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] \"...''seemed antiquated to them''\",<ref name=\"Bowers\">{{cite book|last1=Bowers|first1=Craig|title=The Scientific History of the Perth Observatory from 1960 to 1993|date=2016|location=Murdoch University|page=276|accessdate=April 24, 2017|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/35154/}}</ref> it also reflected similar changes throughout the world with astronomical institutions merging with Universities.\n\n====Michael Philip Candy====\nWith the compulsory retirement age still in place, after Dr I Nikoloff retired, Mr Michael Philip Candy became the first Director of the Perth Observatory.\n\nIn 1969 Candy was offered the position of Director of the [[British Astronomical Association]], however declined due to his plans to emigrate to Australia that year.\n\nAfter arriving in Australia 12 May 1969, he commenced at the Perth Observatory as an ''Astronomer Grade II'' and in November 1969 took over the running of the Perth Observatory Astrographic telescope from Dr I Nikoloff.\n\nHis numerical prowess, gained during his time at [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]], was to be a great asset in the astrometric programs of the Perth Observatory, as was his interest in comets.\n\nIt took little time for Candy to position the Perth Observatory at the forefront of southern cometary astrometry. By 1972, the Perth Observatory was 9th in the world in producing cometary positions. Not content with this, Candy introduced new photographic glass plate processing practices to increase the limiting magnitude of objects achievable at that time from 14th to 19th. The new processes were to see the recovery of five comets and the positioning of the Observatory to 2nd place between 1973 and 1977 and 4th between 1978 and 1984, resulting in him being awarded the prestigious Merlin Medal of the [[British Astronomical Association]] in 1975. Under his direction the Perth Observatory discovered over 100 new [[asteroid]]s as well as contributing a significant number of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]].\n\nHe continued the first publication of the Perth Observatory on comet and minor positions, commenced by Mr B Harris, with Communication No. 2, 3, 4 and the last, that of Communication No. 5 in 1986.\n\nBy 1979 his astrometric abilities and contributions were widely acknowledged and he became Vice President of [[International Astronomical Union]], Commission 6, a position he held until 1982 when he was elected President for a 3-year term. At the same time became a working member of [[International Astronomical Union]] Commission 20 until 1988 \u2013 Positions and Motions of Minor Planets, Satellites and Comets.\n\nThe Perth Observatory was positioned well for [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986/1987 and under Candy the Perth Observatory produced 10% of all Earth based astrometric positions for the comet, the largest contribution in the World.\n\nCandy was a councillor of the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]] from 1988 to 1990, councillor of the [[Royal Society of Western Australia]] between 1988 and 1990, and president of the [[Royal Society of Western Australia]] in 1989 .\n\nHe saw the most drastic staff cuts to the Observatory by the Government in 1987 with 50% of the staff redeployed and one whole section closed down.<ref name=\"Bowers\"/>\n\nWith the compulsory retirement age no longer in place, unlike his predecessor, Candy was able to continue working at the Perth Observatory on projects including the eclipsing binary FO Hydra, a comet hunter telescope, a new theory on comet origins and evolution, the analysis of the lost comet Gale, as well as comparison of a South Australian comet discovered in 1979 with that of a comet from 1770.\n\nIn 1960 he discovered Comet Candy 1960n and was the first [[Astronomer]] to discover, as well as compute, a comets orbit from two more observations within 60 hours of its discovery.\n\nMr M P Candy officially retired on 24 December 1993 and died 2 November 1994.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary - Candy, Michael-Philip - 1928-1994|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=105|pages=56|ref=Vol.105, NO. 2, P. 56, 1995|bibcode=1995JBAA..105...56.|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nHis work was honored by the naming of Minor Planet 3015 Candy in 1980.\n\n====James D Biggs====\nDr James D Biggs commenced at the Perth Observatory in May 1994 and resigned in 2010.<ref name=\"Bowers\"/>\n\n====Ralph Martin (Acting)====\nAfter Dr J D Biggs resigned, Ralph Martin acted in the Directors position until on 22 January 2013 the WA Government announced that all research programs would be cut and the Observatory would only be open for tours.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-22/research-cut-at-the-perth-observatory/4478756 | title=Research programs to be cut at Perth Observatory| date=2013-01-22}}</ref>\n\nMartin and the remaining staff off the Perth Observatory took voluntary redundancy.<ref name=\"Bowers\"/>\n\n===Earthquake records===\nAs an [[Earthquakes in Western Australia|earthquake]] observatory in Perth a [[John Milne|Milne-Shaw seismograph]] was utilised between 1923 and 1959 for the recording of earthquakes in Western Australia.

After nearly being closed by the State Government, the Observatory was moved to its current site at [[Bickley, Western Australia|Bickley]] near Mount Gungin in the [[Darling Range]]. Construction of the new observatory cost $600,000, and it was opened by the Premier Sir David Brand on 30 September 1966.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe observatory has fought off several attempts to close the facility by the [[Government of Western Australia|State Government]], the most serious being in 1987 when it was part of the Department of State Services. An outcry from the public, scientific and amateur communities was helpful in retaining the observatory.\n\nAs of July 2015, The Perth Observatory Volunteer Group runs the Observatory under a community partnership agreement between the Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Perth Observatory Volunteer Group which was signed in June 2015.\n\n====Centenary 1996====\nIn January 1996, the centenary of its foundation, the observatory was transferred to the Department of Conservation and Land Management, now part of the [[Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia)]].<ref>[http://www.atnf.csiro.au/pasa/14_2/biggs/ Spreading the Word - Western Style: Education and Public Awareness Programmes at Perth Observatory] James Biggs, Astronomical Society of Australia 1997.

His successor [[Harold Curlewis]], is standing in the light coloured suit.]]\n\n===First Perth Observatory===\nThe original Perth Observatory was constructed in 1896 and was officially opened in 1900 by [[John Forrest]], the first [[premier of Western Australia]]. The observatory was located at [[Mount Eliza, Western Australia|Mount Eliza]] overlooking the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. Its chief roles were keeping [[Standard Time]] for Western Australia and meteorological data collection.\n\n===<abbr title=\"Western Australian\">WA</abbr> Government Astronomers===\n====William Ernest Cooke====\n\n[[William Ernest Cooke]] was appointed the first [[Western Australian Government Astronomer]] in 1896 after a similar posting at the [[Adelaide Observatory]]. On arrival in Perth, his first task was to determine the exact latitude and longitude of the colony. He was also able to determine the time of day with greater accuracy. Before his arrival clocks could vary by up to half an hour. The [[Time signal|time]] was announced each day by a cannon still present on the grounds. The design was by the government architect, [[George Temple-Poole]], and features a bold combination of [[Australian architectural styles|styles]].\n\n====Harold Burnham Curlewis====\nCooke's successor as [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] was [[Harold Curlewis]] who wrote in 1929:\n<blockquote>Since the prevailing winds blow over the huge extent of King's Park, its excellence for astronomical work is not impaired by its proximity to the city, as is so often the case with other observatories. ...A glance from the tower, from which a wonderful panorama of Perth may be obtained, shows that no growth of the city can ever adversely affect observing conditions<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Civil Service Journal|date=20 July 1929|title=The Perth Observatory|pages=73\u201374|author=H B Curlewis}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=====Curlewis and the WA border=====\n{{see also|Western Australia border}}\n\nIn 1920 and 1921 Curlewis was involved with the [[South Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer of South Australia]], Dodwell, in determinations to fix positions for marking of the [[Western Australia border|West Australian border]] on the ground with the [[South Australian borders|South Australian border]] at [[Deakin, Western Australia]]. In 1921 the same group from the Deakin determinations travelled by the State Ship, MV ''Bambra'' to Wyndham, where they were guided by [[Michael Durack|M.P. Durack]] to a point on Rosewood station near [[Argyle Downs]] close to the [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]] (<abbr title=\"129th meridian east longitude\">129\u00b0 east</abbr>). They used the relatively new technology of the day, wireless radio time signals, and other methods to fix a position for the [[Northern Territory borders|Northern Territory border]] with Western Australia.<ref name=\"notstraight\" />\n\nThese early determinations led to the 1968 agreement for the formation of [[Surveyor Generals Corner]].\n\nThe WA border is not straight ''(see [[Western Australia border]])''; at the [[26th parallel south]] (<abbr title=\"26th parallel south latitude\">26\u00b0 south</abbr>) there is an approximately 127 metre \"sideways\" section of the <abbr title=\"Western Australian\">WA</abbr>/<abbr title=\"Northern Territory\">NT</abbr> border, which runs east-west.<ref name=\"notstraight\" />\n\n====Hyman Solomon Spigl====\nCurlewis's successor as [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] was Hyman Solomon Spigl between 1940 and 1962. Spigl, who was from a surveying background, progressed rebuilding a post war ravaged Observatory by rejuvenating the time service, seismology services, completing the Astrographic Catalogues, became involved in the [[International Geophysical Year]] by installing a Markowitz Moon camera and restarted the publications for the Royal Astronomical Society. Additionally, through a National Science Foundation of America grant, he was in the process of refurbishing the Observatory's 6-inch meridian transit circle to recommence meridian observations. While he never achieved this before his death, and it was never used again, the instrument sits in the foyer of the Perth Observatory now fully refurbished.\n\nIn 1958 Spigl was awarded a [[Robert Gledden|Gledden]] Travelling Fellowship by the [[University of Western Australia]]; Spigl spent 12 months travelling in the US, UK and Europe. Spigl was actively searching for a new site for the Perth Observatory as a result of the decision for it to be relocated as an outcome of the implementation of the 1955 [[Metropolitan Region Scheme|Stephenson-Hepburn Report]]. Spigl spent many years lecturing in surveying at the University of Western Australia and was involved in the Astronomical Society of Western Australia.\n\n====John Bertrand Harris====\nUpon the death of Spigl on 20 August 1962, John Bertrand Harris, who had been Spigl's assistant since 1957, became the fourth [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] of the Perth Observatory between 1962 until the end of 1974.<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/harris-bertrand-john-10433 | title=Australian Dictionary of Biography| chapter=Harris, Bertrand John (1925\u20131974)| publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University}}</ref> Harris had to step in to the position of Government Astronomer at a time when the Perth Observatory was on the move to its new site in the Darling Range, [[Bickley, Western Australia|Bickley]], some 24&nbsp;km east of its original position in the City of [[Perth]]. Clearing of the land in the State Forrest in Bickely commenced in February 1964, with excavations commencing in May 1964 and construction works on buildings continuing through 1965; staff moved in on 19 December 1965.\n\nWith the new Bickely site complete, in 1967, Harris oversaw the installation of a [[meridian circle]] telescope at the Observatory as part of an expedition by [[astronomer]]s from the Hamburg Observatory in Germany. The expedition worked on the international Southern Reference Stars program that resulted in a revised, larger and more accurate meridian catalogue of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]: the Perth 70 meridian catalogue. In 1970 Harris was successful in forming a dedicated Perth Observatory Meridian section to assist the German expedition in their work. After the German expedition left over the 1971/72 Christmas/New Year period, Harris successfully negotiated the loan of the Hamburg telescope indefinitely and obtained funding from the [[Government of Western Australia]] to increase the Meridian staff numbers. This Perth Observatory Meridian team continued and expanded on the German expedition work, resulting in the Perth 75 meridian catalogue.\n\nIn 1967, Harris worked with the [[University of Western Australia]] to install a 16-inch telescope at the Observatory that was built and used by the University of Western Australia staff and students, as well as Perth Observatory astronomers.\n\nHarris then moved the astrographic telescope, which had been in storage since August 1963, to the new site after arranging its refurbishment; the telescope recommenced observations on 29 March 1968, taking second [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] photographic plates for [[proper motion]] studies.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Lowell Observatory]] of Flagstaff Arizona USA, located a 24-inch [[Boller and Chivens]] telescope at the Perth Observatory as part of the [[International Planetary Patrol Program]]. The program was designed to collect 35mm photographic data on the atmospheric and surface features of Solar System planets, mostly Mars, Jupiter and Venus; Harris was to be a regular observer outside his normal daytime Government Astronomer role.\n\nHarris was successful in increasing the technical and astronomical staff numbers at the new Bickley Perth Observatory as its role moved to that of more of a scientific function, however Harris also restarted the public tours on 23 October 1966 and maintained the provision of information services to Western Australia. Harris also continued [[Standard time|time]] and [[tide]] services for Western Australia, however as had been the case in 1908 for Meteorology, the move saw [[seismic]] monitoring activities being relocated to Mundaring under the Commonwealth Government control.\n\nHarris was responsible for the August 1973 [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] Symposium No. 61 in Perth on \"New Problems of Astrometry\". Like his predecessor, he died at an early age, 49, but had raised the standing of the Perth Observatory to a well respected scientific institution within Australia and internationally.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n====Dr Iwan (Ivan) Nikoloff====\nWith the death of Harris on 23 December 1974, Nikoloff was to act in the role of [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] of the Perth Observatory until 30 May 1979 when he officially became the fifth Government Astronomer of the Perth Observatory.\n\nAfter arriving in Australia in 1964, he commenced at the Perth Observatory as an Astronomer Grade II on 1 May 1964 and worked on the Observatory's [[astrograph]]; his previous experience also saw him set up and calibrate the recently acquired Zeiss plate measuring machine. With the relocation of the Perth Observatory from Perth to Bickley, Nikoloff's surveying skills were extensively used in setting up the new Observatory during 1965.\n\nNikoloff worked with the German Hamburg Observatory [[meridian circle]] telescope expedition on the Perth 70 catalogue, from 1969 until 1971, before the expedition [[astronomer]]s returned to Germany that Christmas.\n\nIn 1971, with funding by the [[Government of Western Australia]] and negotiations for the loan of the Hamburg telescope, Nikoloff was placed in charge of the newly formed Perth Observatory Meridian Section. Dr Nikoloff commenced a new observing program of FK4 and FK4 Supplementary stars that would result in the Perth 75 catalogue of 2549 stars. The catalogue not only extended the well revered Perth 70 catalogue, but provided valuable [[Southern Hemisphere]] information for the construction of the new FK5 reference frame sought by the international astronomical community.\n\nAs Government Astronomer, Nikoloff passed on the Meridian Section to D. Harwood, but kept a keen involvement in the construction of the subsequent Perth 83 meridian catalogue. While daily administrative duties kept him busy, Nikoloff continued observing on all the Observatory's telescopes at night and on weekends.\n\nNikoloff maintained a good relationship with the [[University of Western Australia]], was a Foundation member and Fellow of the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]], a life member of the Astronomical Association of Western Australia and a member of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s original Commission 8 (Astrometry) and I (Fundamental Astronomy); he also continued the Observatory's public information services and tours. He retired on 4 January 1985 and died on 8 April 2015.\n\n===Perth Observatory Directors===\nUpon the retirement of Dr I Nikoloff, the governing body of the Perth Observatory at that time, the [[Department of Science and Technology (Australia)]], replaced the primary title of what was previously called the [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]], with the title of [[Director (business)|Director]] Perth Observatory. The reason given was that the title of [[Western Australian Government Astronomer|Government Astronomer]] \"...''seemed antiquated to them''\",<ref name=\"Bowers\">{{cite book|last1=Bowers|first1=Craig|title=The Scientific History of the Perth Observatory from 1960 to 1993|date=2016|location=Murdoch University|page=276|accessdate=April 24, 2017|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/35154/}}</ref> it also reflected similar changes throughout the world with astronomical institutions merging with Universities.\n\n====Michael Philip Candy====\nWith the compulsory retirement age still in place, after Dr I Nikoloff retired, Mr Michael Philip Candy became the first Director of the Perth Observatory.\n\nIn 1969 Candy was offered the position of Director of the [[British Astronomical Association]], however declined due to his plans to emigrate to Australia that year.\n\nAfter arriving in Australia 12 May 1969, he commenced at the Perth Observatory as an ''Astronomer Grade II'' and in November 1969 took over the running of the Perth Observatory Astrographic telescope from Dr I Nikoloff.\n\nHis numerical prowess, gained during his time at [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]], was to be a great asset in the astrometric programs of the Perth Observatory, as was his interest in comets.\n\nIt took little time for Candy to position the Perth Observatory at the forefront of southern cometary astrometry. By 1972, the Perth Observatory was 9th in the world in producing cometary positions. Not content with this, Candy introduced new photographic glass plate processing practices to increase the limiting magnitude of objects achievable at that time from 14th to 19th. The new processes were to see the recovery of five comets and the positioning of the Observatory to 2nd place between 1973 and 1977 and 4th between 1978 and 1984, resulting in him being awarded the prestigious Merlin Medal of the [[British Astronomical Association]] in 1975. Under his direction the Perth Observatory discovered over 100 new [[asteroid]]s as well as contributing a significant number of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]].\n\nHe continued the first publication of the Perth Observatory on comet and minor positions, commenced by Mr B Harris, with Communication No. 2, 3, 4 and the last, that of Communication No. 5 in 1986.\n\nBy 1979 his astrometric abilities and contributions were widely acknowledged and he became Vice President of [[International Astronomical Union]], Commission 6, a position he held until 1982 when he was elected President for a 3-year term. At the same time became a working member of [[International Astronomical Union]] Commission 20 until 1988 \u2013 Positions and Motions of Minor Planets, Satellites and Comets.\n\nThe Perth Observatory was positioned well for [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986/1987 and under Candy the Perth Observatory produced 10% of all Earth based astrometric positions for the comet, the largest contribution in the World.\n\nCandy was a councillor of the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]] from 1988 to 1990, councillor of the [[Royal Society of Western Australia]] between 1988 and 1990, and president of the [[Royal Society of Western Australia]] in 1989 .\n\nHe saw the most drastic staff cuts to the Observatory by the Government in 1987 with 50% of the staff redeployed and one whole section closed down.<ref name=\"Bowers\"/>\n\nWith the compulsory retirement age no longer in place, unlike his predecessor, Candy was able to continue working at the Perth Observatory on projects including the eclipsing binary FO Hydra, a comet hunter telescope, a new theory on comet origins and evolution, the analysis of the lost comet Gale, as well as comparison of a South Australian comet discovered in 1979 with that of a comet from 1770.\n\nIn 1960 he discovered Comet Candy 1960n and was the first [[Astronomer]] to discover, as well as compute, a comets orbit from two more observations within 60 hours of its discovery.\n\nMr M P Candy officially retired on 24 December 1993 and died 2 November 1994.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary - Candy, Michael-Philip - 1928-1994|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=105|pages=56|ref=Vol.105, NO. 2, P. 56, 1995|bibcode=1995JBAA..105...56.|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nHis work was honored by the naming of Minor Planet 3015 Candy in 1980.\n\n====James D Biggs====\nDr James D Biggs commenced at the Perth Observatory in May 1994 and resigned in 2010.<ref name=\"Bowers\"/>\n\n====Ralph Martin (Acting)====\nAfter Dr J D Biggs resigned, Ralph Martin acted in the Directors position until on 22 January 2013 the WA Government announced that all research programs would be cut and the Observatory would only be open for tours.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-22/research-cut-at-the-perth-observatory/4478756 | title=Research programs to be cut at Perth Observatory| date=2013-01-22}}</ref>\n\nMartin and the remaining staff off the Perth Observatory took voluntary redundancy.<ref name=\"Bowers\"/>\n\n===Earthquake records===\nAs an [[Earthquakes in Western Australia|earthquake]] observatory in Perth a [[John Milne|Milne-Shaw seismograph]] was utilised between 1923 and 1959 for the recording of earthquakes in Western Australia.

After nearly being closed by the State Government, the Observatory was moved to its current site at [[Bickley, Western Australia|Bickley]] near Mount Gungin in the [[Darling Range]]. Construction of the new observatory cost $600,000, and it was opened by the Premier Sir David Brand on 30 September 1966.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe observatory has fought off several attempts to close the facility by the [[Government of Western Australia|State Government]], the most serious being in 1987 when it was part of the Department of State Services. An outcry from the public, scientific and amateur communities was helpful in retaining the observatory.\n\nAs of July 2015, The Perth Observatory Volunteer Group runs the Observatory under a community partnership agreement between the Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Perth Observatory Volunteer Group which was signed in June 2015.\n\n====Centenary 1996====\nIn January 1996, the centenary of its foundation, the observatory was transferred to the Department of Conservation and Land Management, now part of the [[Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia)]].<ref>[http://www.atnf.csiro.au/pasa/14_2/biggs/ Spreading the Word - Western Style: Education and Public Awareness Programmes at Perth Observatory] James Biggs, Astronomical Society of Australia 1997.

LGBT people continue to face major discrimination in Uganda, actively encouraged by political and religious leaders. Violent and brutal attacks against LGBT people are common, often performed by state officials.

Same-sex marriage has been constitutionally banned since 2005.\n\nHomosexual relations were accepted and commonplace in pre-colonial Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ilga.org/ugandan-documentary-on-gay-love-in-pre-colonial-africa|title=UGANDAN DOCUMENTARY ON GAY LOVE IN PRE-COLONIAL AFRICA|last=|first=|date=8 June 2012|work=ILGA|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327091827/https://ilga.org/ugandan-documentary-on-gay-love-in-pre-colonial-africa|archive-date=27 March 2019|access-date=}}</ref> The [[British Empire]] introduced laws punishing homosexuality when Uganda became a [[British Empire|British]] colony.

Among the [[Baganda]], Uganda's largest ethnic group, homosexuality was usually treated with indifference. [[Kabaka of Buganda|King]] [[Mwanga II of Buganda]] was famously bisexual, known to have regular sexual relations with women, having had a total of 16 wives, as well as his male subjects. During his reign, he increasingly regarded the Christian missionaries and the European colonial powers, notably the British, as threats.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda|last=Tamale|first=Sylvia|date=2003|website=African Women's Development Fund|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMwanga II took a more aggressive approach than other African leaders, choosing to expel all missionaries and insist that Christian and Muslim converts abandon their faith or [[Uganda Martyrs|face death]]. The [[Luganda]] term {{lang|lg|abasiyazi}} refers to homosexuals, though usage nowadays is commonly pejorative. The Baganda were not the only ethnic group known to engage in homosexual acts. Among the [[Lango people]], ''[[mudoko dako]]'' individuals were believed to form a \"[[third gender]]\" alongside male and female. The {{lang|laj|mudoko dako}} were effeminate men, mostly treated by Langi society as women and could marry other men without social sanctions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Homosexuality was also acknowledged among the [[Teso people|Teso]], Bahima, [[Bunyoro|Banyoro]], and [[Karamojong people]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galck.org/are-you-happy-or-are-you-gay/|title=Are you happy or are you gay?|date=2016-12-06|website=Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Societal acceptance disappeared after the arrival of the British and the creation of the [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref name=\"queer2012\">{{Cite web|url=https://queerstoryfiles.blogspot.com/2012/10/gay-in-great-lakes-of-africa.html|title=Gay in the Great Lakes of Africa|last=Scupham-bilton|first=Tony|date=8 October 2012|website=The Queerstory Files|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nPresently, there is widespread denial that homosexuality was practised before colonisation. Furthermore, the false belief that homosexuality is \"un-African\" or \"Western\" is quite prevalent in Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nThe term {{lang|sw|kuchu}}, of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, is increasingly used by the Ugandan LGBT community.

Those laws were enshrined in the ''Penal Code Act 1950'' and retained following independence. The following sections of that Act are relevant:\n\n<blockquote>'''Section 145. Unnatural offences.''' Any person who\u2014\n:(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; [or]\n:(b) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or\n:(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\ncommits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.<ref name=\"PCA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ug/ug008en.pdf|title=THE PENAL CODE ACT|last=|first=|date=1950|website=World Intellectual Property Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"PCA2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.upf.go.ug/download/resources/Penal_Code_Act_1950.pdf|title=THE PENAL CODE ACT|last=|first=|date=1950|website=Uganda Police Force|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Section 146.

Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 145 commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n'''Section 148. Indecent practices.''' Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/></blockquote>\n\nBefore the ''Penal Code Amendment (Gender References) Act 2000'' was enacted, only same-sex acts between men were criminalized. In 2000, that Act was passed and changed references to \"any male\" to \"any person\" so that grossly indecent acts between women were criminalized as well, and are now punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment. The Act also extended this criminalizing such acts to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. This effectively outlawed both [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], regardless of sexual orientation, under the Penal Code.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n====Anti-Homosexuality Act====\n{{Main|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill}}\nOn 13 October 2009, Member of Parliament [[David Bahati]] introduced the ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2009]]'', which would broaden the criminalization of same-sex relationships in [Uganda and introduce the death penalty for serial offenders, HIV-positive people who engage in sexual activity with people of the same sex, and persons who engage in same-sex sexual acts with people under 18 years of age. Individuals or companies that promote LGBT rights would be fined or imprisoned, or both. Persons \"in authority\" would be required to report any offence under the Act within 24 hours or face up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2012, Parliament Speaker [[Rebecca Kadaga]] promised to pass a revised anti-homosexuality law in December 2012. \"Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift.

[[Simon Lokodo]], Minister for Ethics and Integrity, is known by Ugandan LGBT activists as \"the country's main homophobe\", has suggested that rape is more morally acceptable than consensual sex between people of the same sex, has accompanied violent police raids on LGBT events and actively suppresses freedom of speech and of assembly for LGBT people.<ref name=\"mamba\"/>\n\nUganda's main [[LGBT rights]] organization is [[Sexual Minorities Uganda]], founded in 2004 by [[Victor Mukasa]] and has been allowed to conduct its activities without much government interference.

Among the [[Baganda]], Uganda's largest ethnic group, homosexuality was usually treated with indifference. [[Kabaka of Buganda|King]] [[Mwanga II of Buganda]] was famously bisexual, known to have regular sexual relations with women, having had a total of 16 wives, as well as his male subjects. During his reign, he increasingly regarded the Christian missionaries and the European colonial powers, notably the British, as threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref>\n\nMwanga II took a more aggressive approach than other African leaders, choosing to expel all missionaries and insist that Christian and Muslim converts abandon their faith or [[Uganda Martyrs|face death]]. The [[Luganda]] term {{lang|lg|abasiyazi}} refers to homosexuals, though usage nowadays is commonly pejorative. The Baganda were not the only ethnic group known to engage in homosexual acts. Among the [[Lango people]], ''[[mudoko dako]]'' individuals were believed to form a \"[[third gender]]\" alongside male and female.

Furthermore, the false belief that homosexuality is \"un-African\" or \"Western\" is quite prevalent in Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nThe term {{lang|sw|kuchu}}, of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, is increasingly used by the Ugandan LGBT community.

Those laws were enshrined in the ''Penal Code Act 1950'' and retained following independence. The following sections of that Act are relevant:\n\n<blockquote>'''Section 145. Unnatural offences.''' Any person who\u2014\n:(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; [or]\n:(b) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or\n:(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\ncommits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.<ref name=\"PCA\">[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ug/ug008en.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, World Intellectual Property Organization]</ref><ref name=\"PCA2\">[http://www.upf.go.ug/download/resources/Penal_Code_Act_1950.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, Uganda Police Force]</ref>\n\n'''Section 146. Attempt to commit unnatural offences.''' Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 145 commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n'''Section 148. Indecent practices.''' Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/></blockquote>\n\nBefore the ''Penal Code Amendment (Gender References) Act 2000'' was enacted, only same-sex acts between men were criminalized. In 2000, that Act was passed and changed references to \"any male\" to \"any person\" so that grossly indecent acts between women were criminalized as well, and are now punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment. The Act also extended this criminalizing such acts to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. This effectively outlawed both [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], regardless of sexual orientation, under the Penal Code.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n====Anti-Homosexuality Act====\n{{Main|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill}}\nOn 13 October 2009, Member of Parliament [[David Bahati]] introduced the ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2009]]'', which would broaden the criminalization of same-sex relationships in [Uganda and introduce the death penalty for serial offenders, HIV-positive people who engage in sexual activity with people of the same sex, and persons who engage in same-sex sexual acts with people under 18 years of age. Individuals or companies that promote LGBT rights would be fined or imprisoned, or both. Persons \"in authority\" would be required to report any offence under the Act within 24 hours or face up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2012, Parliament Speaker [[Rebecca Kadaga]] promised to pass a revised anti-homosexuality law in December 2012. \"Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift.

[[Simon Lokodo]], Minister for Ethics and Integrity, is known by Ugandan LGBT activists as \"the country's main homophobe\", has suggested that rape is more morally acceptable than consensual sex between people of the same sex, has accompanied violent police raids on LGBT events and actively suppresses freedom of speech and of assembly for LGBT people.<ref name=\"mamba\"/>\n\nUganda's main [[LGBT rights]] organization is [[Sexual Minorities Uganda]], founded in 2004 by [[Victor Mukasa]] and has been allowed to conduct its activities without much government interference.

The \"family name first\" order follows the system of [[Chinese name]]s and is common throughout the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. However, it is different from Chinese, [[Korean name|Korean]], and [[Japanese name]]s in the usage of \"middle names\", as they are less common in China and Korea and do not exist in Japan. <!--Question: What about Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma in ''Kuromukuro''? I'm still confused there :(--> Persons can be referred to by the whole name, the given name or [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|a hierarchic pronoun]], which usually connotes a degree of family relationship or kinship, in normal usage.\n\nDue to the frequency of the major family names such as [[Nguy\u1ec5n]], [[Tr\u1ea7n]], and [[L\u00ea]], persons are often referred to by their middle name along with their given name in Vietnamese media and youth culture.\n\nThe [[Vietnamese language]] is tonal, and so are Vietnamese names.

The name ''[[Nguy\u1ec5n]]'' is estimated to be used by almost 40% of the Vietnamese population.

other [[East Asian]] cultures, including [[Chinese culture]] to the north and the northeast.\n\nIn formal contexts, people are referred to by their full name. In more casual contexts, people are always on a \"first name basis\", which involves their given names, accompanied by proper [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|kinship terms]]. There is no such thing as a \"last name basis\", or family name basis, in Vietnam.\n\n==Middle name==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nMost Vietnamese have one middle name, but it is quite possible to have two or more of them or to have no middle name at all.\n\nIn the past, the middle name was selected by parents from a fairly narrow range of options. Almost all women had ''Th\u1ecb'' ({{vi-nom|\u6c0f}}) as their middle name, and many men had ''V\u0103n'' ({{vi-nom|\u6587}}). More recently, a broader range of names has been used, and people named ''Th\u1ecb'' sometimes omit their middle name.\n\n''Th\u1ecb'' is by far the most common female middle name. That word expresses possession. For example, \"Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Mai Loan\" is a person who has the given name of \"Mai Loan\" and the surname \"Tr\u1ea7n\", and the combination \"Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb\" means \"a female person belonging to the Tr\u1ea7n family.\"  Male middle names include ''V\u0103n'' ({{vi-nom|\u6587}}), ''H\u1eefu'' ({{vi-nom|\u53cb}}), ''\u0110\u1ee9c'' ({{vi-nom|\u5fb7}}), ''Th\u00e0nh'' ({{vi-nom|\u8aa0}}), ''C\u00f4ng'' ({{vi-nom|\u516c}}), and ''Quang'' ({{vi-nom|\u5149}}).\n\nThe middle name can have three uses:\n# To indicate a person's generation. Brothers and sisters share the same middle name, which distinguish them from the generation before them and the generation after them (see [[generation name]]).\n# To separate branches of a large family: \"Nguy\u1ec5n ''H\u1eefu''\", \"Nguy\u1ec5n ''Sinh''\", \"Tr\u1ea7n ''L\u00e2m''\" (middle names can be taken from the mother's family name). However, this usage is still controversial{{dubious|date=July 2018}}{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Some people{{who|date=July 2018}} consider them to be dual family names, not family name + middle name. Some families may, however, set up arbitrary rules about giving a different middle name to each generation.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}\n# To indicate a person's position ([[birth order]]) in the family. This usage is less common than others.\n\nHowever, most middle names now do not have those uses. They can have a meaning or only make the full name sound better.\n\n==Given name==\nIn most cases, the middle name is formally part of the given name. For example, the name \"\u0110inh Quang D\u0169ng\" is separated into the surname \"\u0110inh\" and the given name \"Quang D\u0169ng\". In a normal name list, those two parts of the full name are put in two different columns. However, in daily conversation, the last word in a given name with a title before it is used to address a person: \"\u00d4ng D\u0169ng\", \"Anh D\u0169ng\", etc., with \"\u00d4ng\" and \"Anh\" being words to address the person and depend on age, social position, etc.\n\nThe given name is the primary form of address for Vietnamese. It is chosen by parents and usually has a literal meaning in the [[Vietnamese language]]. Names often represent beauty, such as bird or flower names, or attributes and characteristics that the parents want in their child, such as modesty (''Khi\u00eam'', \u8b19).\n\nTypically, Vietnamese will be addressed with their given name, even in formal situations, although an honorific equivalent to \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.\", etc. will be added when necessary. That contrasts with the situation in many other cultures in which the family name is used in formal situations, but it is a practice similar to usage in [[Icelandic name|Icelandic]] usage and, to some degree, [[Polish name|Polish]]. It is similar to the Latin-American and southern European custom of referring to women as \"[[Don (honorific)|Do\u00f1a]]\" and men as \"[[Don (honorific)|Don]]\", along with their first name.\n\nAddressing someone by the family name is rare. In the past, married women in the north were called by their (maiden) family name, with ''Th\u1ecb'' (\u6c0f) as a suffix. In recent years, doctors are more likely than any other social group to be addressed by their family name, but that form of reference is more common in the north than in the south. Some extremely famous people are sometimes referred to by their family names, such as [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] (''B\u00e1c H\u1ed3''\u2014\"''Uncle H\u1ed3''{{-\"}}) (however, his real surname is Nguy\u1ec5n), [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n]] (''nh\u1ea1c Tr\u1ecbnh''\u2014\"''Tr\u1ecbnh music''{{-\"}}), and [[H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (''n\u1eef s\u0129 h\u1ecd H\u1ed3''\u2014\"''the poetess with the family name H\u1ed3''{{-\"}}). Traditionally, people in Vietnam, particularly North Vietnam, addressed parents using the first child's name: Mr and Mrs Anh or Master Minh.\n\nWhen being addressed within the family, children are sometimes referred to by their birth number, starting with one in the north but two in the south. That practice is less common recently, especially in the north.\n\n[[Double name]]s are common among females, especially in combination with the name {{lang|vi|italic=no|[[wikt:Kim#Vietnamese|Kim]]}}. For example, {{lang|vi|italic=no|[[Phan Th\u1ecb Kim Ph\u00fac]]}} has the given name {{lang|vi|italic=no|Kim Ph\u00fac}}.\n\n===Examples===\n*[[Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng]] is the former [[Prime Minister of Vietnam]]. ''Nguy\u1ec5n'' is his family name, ''T\u1ea5n'' is his middle name, and ''D\u0169ng'' is his given name. In formal usage, he is referred to by his given name (\"Mr. D\u0169ng\"), not by his family name (\"Mr. Nguy\u1ec5n\").\n*Likewise, the famous general and military leader, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], is referred to by his given name, i.e. \"General Gi\u00e1p\".\n\n==Saints' names==\n[[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Vietnamese Catholic]]s are given a [[saint's name]] at [[baptism]] ({{lang-vi|t\u00ean th\u00e1nh}} or {{lang|vi|t\u00ean r\u1eeda t\u1ed9i}}). Boys are given male saints' names, while girls are given female saints' names. This name appears first, before the family name, in formal religious contexts. Out of respect, clergy are usually referred to by saints' name. The saint's name also functions as a [[posthumous name]], used instead of an individual's given name in prayers after their death. The most common saints' names are taken from the [[New Testament]], such as {{lang|vi|Ph\u00ear\u00f4}} (Peter), {{lang|vi|Phaol\u00f4}} (Paul), {{lang|vi|Gioan}} (John), {{lang|vi|Maria}} (Mary), and {{lang|vi|Anna}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=T\u00ecm Hi\u1ec3u T\u00ean Th\u00e1nh C\u1ee7a Ng\u01b0\u1eddi C\u00f4ng Gi\u00e1o Vi\u1ec7t Nam|trans-title=Understanding the Saint's Names of Vietnamese Catholics|author=Nguy\u1ec5n Long Thao|work=VietCatholic News|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=29 March 2019|url=http://www.vietcatholic.net/News/Html/98332.htm|language=vi}}</ref>\n\nSaints' names are respelled phonetically according to the [[Vietnamese alphabet]].

The \"family name first\" order follows the system of [[Chinese name]]s and is common throughout the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. However, it is different from Chinese, [[Korean name|Korean]], and [[Japanese name]]s in the usage of \"middle names\", as they are less common in China and Korea and do not exist in Japan. <!--Question: What about Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma in ''Kuromukuro''? I'm still confused there :(--> Persons can be referred to by the whole name, the given name or [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|a hierarchic pronoun]], which usually connotes a degree of family relationship or kinship, in normal usage.\n\nDue to the frequency of the major family names such as [[Nguy\u1ec5n]], [[Tr\u1ea7n]], and [[L\u00ea]], persons are often referred to by their middle name along with their given name in Vietnamese media and youth culture.\n\nThe [[Vietnamese language]] is tonal, and so are Vietnamese names. Names with the same spelling (ignoring diacritics) but with different tones are different names, which can confuse non-Vietnamese people when the diacritics are dropped, as is commonly done outside Vietnam.\n\nAnyone applying for Vietnamese nationality must adopt a Vietnamese name.<ref>[https://www.justlanded.com/english/Vietnam/Vietnam-Guide/Visas-Permits/How-to-become-a-Vietnamese-citizen Viet name is mandatory for citizenship]</ref>\n\n==Family name==\nThe family name is positioned first and is passed on by the father to his children. It is estimated that there are around 100 family names in common use, but some are far more common than others. The name ''[[Nguy\u1ec5n]]'' is estimated to be used by almost 40% of the Vietnamese population.  The top three names are so popular because people tended to take family names of emperors to show their loyalty. Over many generations, family names became permanent.\n\n[[File:Common Viet Surnames.png|500px|right|thumb|Distribution of Vietnamese family names]]\n\nThe most common family names among the

other [[East Asian]] cultures, including [[Chinese culture]] to the north and the northeast.\n\nIn formal contexts, people are referred to by their full name. In more casual contexts, people are always on a \"first name basis\", which involves their given names, accompanied by proper [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|kinship terms]]. There is no such thing as a \"last name basis\", or family name basis, in Vietnam.\n\n==Middle name==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nMost Vietnamese have one middle name, but it is quite possible to have two or more of them or to have no middle name at all.\n\nIn the past, the middle name was selected by parents from a fairly narrow range of options. Almost all women had ''Th\u1ecb'' ({{vi-nom|\u6c0f}}) as their middle name, and many men had ''V\u0103n'' ({{vi-nom|\u6587}}). More recently, a broader range of names has been used, and people named ''Th\u1ecb'' sometimes omit their middle name.\n\n''Th\u1ecb'' is by far the most common female middle name. That word expresses possession. For example, \"Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb Mai Loan\" is a person who has the given name of \"Mai Loan\" and the surname \"Tr\u1ea7n\", and the combination \"Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb\" means \"a female person belonging to the Tr\u1ea7n family.\"  Male middle names include ''V\u0103n'' ({{vi-nom|\u6587}}), ''H\u1eefu'' ({{vi-nom|\u53cb}}), ''\u0110\u1ee9c'' ({{vi-nom|\u5fb7}}), ''Th\u00e0nh'' ({{vi-nom|\u8aa0}}), ''C\u00f4ng'' ({{vi-nom|\u516c}}), and ''Quang'' ({{vi-nom|\u5149}}).\n\nThe middle name can have three uses:\n# To indicate a person's generation. Brothers and sisters share the same middle name, which distinguish them from the generation before them and the generation after them (see [[generation name]]).\n# To separate branches of a large family: \"Nguy\u1ec5n ''H\u1eefu''\", \"Nguy\u1ec5n ''Sinh''\", \"Tr\u1ea7n ''L\u00e2m''\" (middle names can be taken from the mother's family name). However, this usage is still controversial{{dubious|date=July 2018}}{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Some people{{who|date=July 2018}} consider them to be dual family names, not family name + middle name. Some families may, however, set up arbitrary rules about giving a different middle name to each generation.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}\n# To indicate a person's position ([[birth order]]) in the family. This usage is less common than others.\n\nHowever, most middle names now do not have those uses. They can have a meaning or only make the full name sound better.\n\n==Given name==\nIn most cases, the middle name is formally part of the given name. For example, the name \"\u0110inh Quang D\u0169ng\" is separated into the surname \"\u0110inh\" and the given name \"Quang D\u0169ng\". In a normal name list, those two parts of the full name are put in two different columns. However, in daily conversation, the last word in a given name with a title before it is used to address a person: \"\u00d4ng D\u0169ng\", \"Anh D\u0169ng\", etc., with \"\u00d4ng\" and \"Anh\" being words to address the person and depend on age, social position, etc.\n\nThe given name is the primary form of address for Vietnamese. It is chosen by parents and usually has a literal meaning in the [[Vietnamese language]]. Names often represent beauty, such as bird or flower names, or attributes and characteristics that the parents want in their child, such as modesty (''Khi\u00eam'', \u8b19).\n\nTypically, Vietnamese will be addressed with their given name, even in formal situations, although an honorific equivalent to \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.\", etc. will be added when necessary. That contrasts with the situation in many other cultures in which the family name is used in formal situations, but it is a practice similar to usage in [[Icelandic name|Icelandic]] usage and, to some degree, [[Polish name|Polish]]. It is similar to the Latin-American and southern European custom of referring to women as \"[[Don (honorific)|Do\u00f1a]]\" and men as \"[[Don (honorific)|Don]]\", along with their first name.\n\nAddressing someone by the family name is rare. In the past, married women in the north were called by their (maiden) family name, with ''Th\u1ecb'' (\u6c0f) as a suffix. In recent years, doctors are more likely than any other social group to be addressed by their family name, but that form of reference is more common in the north than in the south. Some extremely famous people are sometimes referred to by their family names, such as [[Ho Chi Minh|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] (''B\u00e1c H\u1ed3''\u2014\"''Uncle H\u1ed3''{{-\"}}) (however, his real surname is Nguy\u1ec5n), [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u00f4ng S\u01a1n]] (''nh\u1ea1c Tr\u1ecbnh''\u2014\"''Tr\u1ecbnh music''{{-\"}}), and [[H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (''n\u1eef s\u0129 h\u1ecd H\u1ed3''\u2014\"''the poetess with the family name H\u1ed3''{{-\"}}). Traditionally, people in Vietnam, particularly North Vietnam, addressed parents using the first child's name: Mr and Mrs Anh or Master Minh.\n\nWhen being addressed within the family, children are sometimes referred to by their birth number, starting with one in the north but two in the south. That practice is less common recently, especially in the north.\n\n[[Double name]]s are common among females, especially in combination with the name {{lang|vi|italic=no|[[wikt:Kim#Vietnamese|Kim]]}}. For example, {{lang|vi|italic=no|[[Phan Th\u1ecb Kim Ph\u00fac]]}} has the given name {{lang|vi|italic=no|Kim Ph\u00fac}}.\n\n===Examples===\n*[[Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng]] is the former [[Prime Minister of Vietnam]]. ''Nguy\u1ec5n'' is his family name, ''T\u1ea5n'' is his middle name, and ''D\u0169ng'' is his given name. In formal usage, he is referred to by his given name (\"Mr. D\u0169ng\"), not by his family name (\"Mr. Nguy\u1ec5n\").\n*Likewise, the famous general and military leader, [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]], is referred to by his given name, i.e. \"General Gi\u00e1p\".\n\n==Saints' names==\n[[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Vietnamese Catholic]]s are given a [[saint's name]] at [[baptism]] ({{lang-vi|t\u00ean th\u00e1nh}} or {{lang|vi|t\u00ean r\u1eeda t\u1ed9i}}). Boys are given male saints' names, while girls are given female saints' names. This name appears first, before the family name, in formal religious contexts. Out of respect, clergy are usually referred to by saints' name. The saint's name also functions as a [[posthumous name]], used instead of an individual's given name in prayers after their death. The most common saints' names are taken from the [[New Testament]], such as {{lang|vi|Ph\u00ear\u00f4}} (Peter), {{lang|vi|Phaol\u00f4}} (Paul), {{lang|vi|Gioan}} (John), {{lang|vi|Maria}} (Mary), and {{lang|vi|Anna}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=T\u00ecm Hi\u1ec3u T\u00ean Th\u00e1nh C\u1ee7a Ng\u01b0\u1eddi C\u00f4ng Gi\u00e1o Vi\u1ec7t Nam|trans-title=Understanding the Saint's Names of Vietnamese Catholics|author=Nguy\u1ec5n Long Thao|work=VietCatholic News|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=29 March 2019|url=http://www.vietcatholic.net/News/Html/98332.htm|language=vi}}</ref>\n\nSaints' names are respelled phonetically according to the [[Vietnamese alphabet]].
