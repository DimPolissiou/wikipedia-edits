It is only found in south-eastern [[Madagascar]].  Like most species of [[lemur]], it is [[arboreal]], moving [[quadruped]]ally and occasionally leaping from tree to tree.  Like other brown lemurs, this species is cathemeral (active during the day and the night; for more information please refer to [[Cathemerality]]), lives in social groups, primarily eats fruit, exhibits [[sexual dichromatism]], and does not demonstrate [[Matriarchy|female dominance]].  The species is listed as ''Endangered'' by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and is threatened primarily by [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nTogether with the twelve other [[true lemur]]s (genus ''Eulemur''),{{r|2008MittermeierGroves}} the collared brown lemur (''E. collaris'') is a type of [[lemur]]  belonging to the family [[Lemuridae]].  Collectively, lemurs (infraorder Lemuriformes) are classified as [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s.  Originally listed as a subspecies of the [[common brown lemur]] (''E. fulvus''), the collared brown lemur was promoted to full species status in 2001 by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Colin Groves]].{{r|MSW3}}\n\n==Anatomy and physiology==\nAn adult collared brown lemur can reach a head-body length of {{convert|39|and|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} and have a tail length of {{convert|50|and|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} for an overall length of {{convert|89|and|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  It has an average body weight of {{convert|2.25|and|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it a medium-sized lemur.{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}  The only form of [[sexual dimorphism]] exhibited by the collared brown lemur is [[sexual dichromatism|dichromatism]].  The following table illustrates the coloration differences between the sexes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" align=\"center\"\n|+Differences in coloration between sexes in the collared brown lemur{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}\n|-\n!\n! width=45% | Male\n! width=45% | Female\n|-1796\n!

Both have big ears and a long snout|Collared brown lemurs:<br>Female (top) and male (bottom)<br>(Illustration from 1892)]]\nIn the wild, the collared brown lemur's range does not overlap with other brown lemurs, so it is rarely confused with other species.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  However, in captivity it can be easily confused with the [[gray-headed lemur]] (''Eulemur cinereiceps'') due to similar coloration.  The male collared brown lemur can be distinguished by their cream-colored or rufous beards, whereas the male gray-headed lemur has a white beard.  Females of these two species are nearly indistinguishable, even though genetic analyses support full species status for both taxa.{{r|2006Mittermeier}} In [[Berenty Reserve]], the species have hybridized with [[Red lemur]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=M|date=2007|title=Habitat use and social structure of a brown lemur hybrid population in the Berenty Reserve, Madagascar|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=69 |issue=10|pages=1189\u20131194|doi=10.1002/ajp.20416|pmid=17294429}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nFound in tropical moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the collared brown lemur occurs west to the forests of [[Kalambatritra Reserve|Kalambatritra]] and in the south from [[T\u00f4lanaro]] north to the [[Mananara River]].{{r|IUCN|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}} The Mananara River is the boundary between the ranges of the collared brown lemur and the gray-headed lemur to the north. The collared brown lemur can be found in the littoral forests of [[Mandena Conservation Zone]], [[Sainte Luce Reserve]], and [[Andohahela National Park]].{{r|2006Mittermeier}}\n\nIn its environment, the collared brown lemur acts as a [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]], and is especially critical for the dispersal of large-seeded fruiting trees within its range.{{r|2004Bollen}}  However, there is no evidence that these relationships are [[coevolution]]ary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed dispersers for these tree species following the extinction of larger [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] birds and [[subfossil lemur]]s.{{r|2004Bollen_a}}\n\n==Behavior==\nA lot is known on this species' diet. These lemurs show great dietary flexibility, feeding on fruits from over 100 plant species. They are also [[cathemeral]] (active both day and night throughout the year), a trait seen in some other members of its genus.{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}  Research has suggested that metabolic dietary-related needs are the leading factor behind this behavior, although the specific hours of this activity pattern can shift based on [[Moon|lunar]] [[luminosity]] and seasonal changes in the [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] (day length).{{r|2009Donatia}}  Previous studies had ruled out effects of predators on the expression of this trait, and instead pointed to fruit availability and fiber intake as more important factors.{{r|2007Donatia}}\n\nThe collared brown lemur tends to live in social groups that are multi-male/multi-female,{{r|2006Mittermeier}} with groups ranging in size from two to seventeen individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Donati, G.|author2=Bollen, A.|author3=Borgognini-Tarli, S.M.|author4=Ganzhorn, J.U.|date=2007|title=Feeding over the 24-h cycle: Dietary flexibility of cathemeral collared lemurs (Eulemur collaris).|url=|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=61|issue=8|pages=1237\u20131251|doi=10.1007/s00265-007-0354-x}}</ref>  Population densities are estimated at 14 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, and it appears to be common within its range.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}  Females give birth to one offspring between October and December, and male involvement with the young has been observed.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  [[Matriarchy|Female dominance]], a common behavioral trait in many lemur species but uncommon in most [[true lemur]]s, has not been observed in this species.{{r|2006Mittermeier|1999Sussman}}\n{{clear}}\n\nBrown lemurs at Berenty (hybrid ''E. fulvus'' x ''collaris'') <ref>{{cite book|title=Ringtailed Lemur Biology: Lemur catta in Madagascar| chapter = Berenty Reserve: a research site in southern Madagascar |author1=Alison Jolly |author2=Naoki Koyama |author3=Hantanirina Rasamimanana |author4=Helen Crowley |author5=George Williams | editor = A.

It is only found in south-eastern [[Madagascar]].  Like most species of [[lemur]], it is [[arboreal]], moving [[quadruped]]ally and occasionally leaping from tree to tree.  Like other brown lemurs, this species is cathemeral (active during the day and the night; for more information please refer to [[Cathemerality]]), lives in social groups, primarily eats fruit, exhibits [[sexual dichromatism]], and does not demonstrate [[Matriarchy|female dominance]].  The species is listed as ''Endangered'' by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) and is threatened primarily by [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nTogether with the twelve other [[true lemur]]s (genus ''Eulemur''),{{r|2008MittermeierGroves}} the collared brown lemur (''E. collaris'') is a type of [[lemur]]  belonging to the family [[Lemuridae]].  Collectively, lemurs (infraorder Lemuriformes) are classified as [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[primate]]s.  Originally listed as a subspecies of the [[common brown lemur]] (''E. fulvus''), the collared brown lemur was promoted to full species status in 2001 by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Colin Groves]].{{r|MSW3}}\n\n==Anatomy and physiology==\nAn adult collared brown lemur can reach a head-body length of {{convert|39|and|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} and have a tail length of {{convert|50|and|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} for an overall length of {{convert|89|and|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}.  It has an average body weight of {{convert|2.25|and|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, making it a medium-sized lemur.{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}  The only form of [[sexual dimorphism]] exhibited by the collared brown lemur is [[sexual dichromatism|dichromatism]].  The following table illustrates the coloration differences between the sexes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" align=\"center\"\n|+Differences in coloration between sexes in the collared brown lemur{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}\n|-\n!\n! width=45% | Male\n! width=45% | Female\n|-1796\n!

Both have big ears and a long snout|Collared brown lemurs:<br>Female (top) and male (bottom)<br>(Illustration from 1892)]]\nIn the wild, the collared brown lemur's range does not overlap with other brown lemurs, so it is rarely confused with other species.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  However, in captivity it can be easily confused with the [[gray-headed lemur]] (''Eulemur cinereiceps'') due to similar coloration.  The male collared brown lemur can be distinguished by their cream-colored or rufous beards, whereas the male gray-headed lemur has a white beard.  Females of these two species are nearly indistinguishable, even though genetic analyses support full species status for both taxa.{{r|2006Mittermeier}} In [[Berenty Reserve]], the species have hybridized with [[Red lemur]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=M|date=2007|title=Habitat use and social structure of a brown lemur hybrid population in the Berenty Reserve, Madagascar|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=69 |issue=10|pages=1189\u20131194|doi=10.1002/ajp.20416|pmid=17294429}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nFound in tropical moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the collared brown lemur occurs west to the forests of [[Kalambatritra Reserve|Kalambatritra]] and in the south from [[T\u00f4lanaro]] north to the [[Mananara River]].{{r|IUCN|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}} The Mananara River is the boundary between the ranges of the collared brown lemur and the Gray-headed Lemur to the north. The collared brown lemur can be found in the littoral forests of [[Mandena Conservation Zone]], [[Sainte Luce Reserve]], and [[Andohahela National Park]].{{r|2006Mittermeier}}\n\nIn its environment, the collared brown lemur acts as a [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]], and is especially critical for the dispersal of large-seeded fruiting trees within its range.{{r|2004Bollen}}  However, there is no evidence that these relationships are [[coevolution]]ary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed dispersers for these tree species following the extinction of larger [[Frugivore|frugivorous]] birds and [[subfossil lemur]]s.{{r|2004Bollen_a}}\n\n==Behavior==\nA lot is known on this species' diet. These lemurs show great dietary flexibility, feeding on fruits from over 100 plant species. They are also [[cathemeral]] (active both day and night throughout the year), a trait seen in some other members of its genus.{{r|2006Mittermeier|2007Garbutt}}  Research has suggested that metabolic dietary-related needs are the leading factor behind this behavior, although the specific hours of this activity pattern can shift based on [[Moon|lunar]] [[luminosity]] and seasonal changes in the [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] (day length).{{r|2009Donatia}}  Previous studies had ruled out effects of predators on the expression of this trait, and instead pointed to fruit availability and fiber intake as more important factors.{{r|2007Donatia}}\n\nThe collared brown lemur tends to live in social groups that are multi-male/multi-female,{{r|2006Mittermeier}} with groups ranging in size from two to seventeen individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Donati, G.|author2=Bollen, A.|author3=Borgognini-Tarli, S.M.|author4=Ganzhorn, J.U.|date=2007|title=Feeding over the 24-h cycle: Dietary flexibility of cathemeral collared lemurs (Eulemur collaris).|url=|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=61|issue=8|pages=1237\u20131251|doi=10.1007/s00265-007-0354-x}}</ref>  Population densities are estimated at 14 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>, and it appears to be common within its range.{{r|2006Mittermeier}}  Females give birth to one offspring between October and December, and male involvement with the young has been observed.{{r|2007Garbutt}}  [[Matriarchy|Female dominance]], a common behavioral trait in many lemur species but uncommon in most [[true lemur]]s, has not been observed in this species.{{r|2006Mittermeier|1999Sussman}}\n{{clear}}\n\nBrown lemurs at Berenty (hybrid ''E. fulvus'' x ''collaris'') <ref>{{cite book|title=Ringtailed Lemur Biology: Lemur catta in Madagascar| chapter = Berenty Reserve: a research site in southern Madagascar |author1=Alison Jolly |author2=Naoki Koyama |author3=Hantanirina Rasamimanana |author4=Helen Crowley |author5=George Williams | editor = A.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

It was released as the lead [[Music download|digital]] single from the studio album on April 14, 2009 by [[Universal Motown Republic Group]], which also marks as her first single released from the label. Written and produced by Amos herself, just like the rest of the album, the song was recorded at her husband's studio in England, Martian Studios.\n\nMusically, the song is a mid-tempo [[alternative rock]] song that features a variety of [[classical music]], including influences of [[britpop]], piano rock, [[baroque pop]], [[ambient music]] and [[chamber pop]] music, along with modern electronica influences. The song's development discusses a woman who has left everything, including her family, friends and lifestyle, to start a new life with her lover. She has cited her husband as her inspiration towards the song, due to her constant move to England. Lyrical themes involve [[love]], departure and [[family]].\n\nContemporary critics were generally favorable towards the song, who commended the personal subject matter and production. However, some critics felt it lacked originality and didn't live up to expectations. Commercially, the song did not live up to expectations; The song only managed to peak inside the top ten in countries including New Zealand and the United States, where it peaked at four and ten. It did chart in Belgium, but only managed to peak at twenty-four and managed to chart outside the top 100 in Russia. To date, this is Amos' last charting single in any mainstream charts, until her 2012 single \"[[Flavor (Tori Amos song)|Flavor]]\" was released. An accompanying [[music video]] was shot for the single, which featured Amos as two characters; herself and Isabel, a character that was previously featured in her studio album, ''[[American Doll Posse]]''. The music video features her walking around iconic landmarks around London, England.\n\n==Background==\nBefore the production of the single and the studio album ''[[Abnormally Attracted to Sin]]'', ''Abnormally Attracted to Sin'' was intended to be an audio-visual project including an abundance of synchronizing visuals, and filming these ''Visualettes'' was a significant catalyst for the development of the album itself.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bryant| first = Christopher| title = From the Fringes of the Milkway: An Interview with Tori Amos | publisher = Polari| url =http://www.polarimagazine.com/interviews/fringes-of-milky-way-interview-tori-amos/| date= 2009-05-09| accessdate =2009-08-14}}</ref> Then Christian Lamb  was hired to by Amos to shoot footage of her 2007 world tour for an intended live/concert DVD.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Tori Amos Explains New Album Title, Releases New Video | publisher = www.antiMusic.com| url =http://www.antimusic.com/news/09/april/16Tori_Amos_Explains_New_Album_Title,_Releases_New_Video.shtml| date = 2009-04-16 | accessdate =2009-04-25}}</ref> However, there were disagreements between her and her record label [[Epic Records]], so she left the record label, leaving ''Visualettes'' to be postponed. She was with Epic since the release of her seventh studio album, ''[[Scarlet's Walk]]'' (2002). After her leaving of the label, Amos officially stated that from now on, she would be releasing her future studio albums and singles independently. However, the idea was then scrapped as Amos signed a new deal to [[Universal Republic Records]], making \"Welcome to England\" and ''Abnormally Attracted to Sin'' her first releases under the label.<ref name=\"Sin01\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Tori Amos to Release ABNORMALLY ATTRACTED TO SIN on May 19 | publisher = Universal Republic| url =http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090310006045&newsLang=en| date = 2009-03-10 | accessdate =2009-03-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Seattle\">{{cite web | last = Jasmin| first = Ernest| title = Tacoma News Tribune Interview (July 9, 2009) | publisher = Tacoma News Tribune| url=http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/ej/2009/07/08/tori_amos_plots_seattle_tour_launch}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the photography with her studio album, she enlisted fashion photographer Karen Collins.

And as she took on his friends, his life, his family, she lost. }}\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Welcome to England\" received favorable reviews from music critics.

Another main reason why was because Amos announced she would release her singles independently through major record labels. The song didn't manage to chart inside the US ''[[Billboard Hot 100]], however it did debut at number twenty-nine on the US [[Adult Album Alternative]] chart, but it later rose to number seventeen, and eventually peaked at number ten.<ref>[http://undented.com/news/1752/chart-action-welcome-to-england-and-maybe-california Undented - Tori Amos Fan Site]</ref> The song became Amos' fifth top ten single to enter that chart, and is currently her last single to chart in the United States or any of its component charts.\n\nIn Belgium (Flanders), the song debuted at number twenty-nine on the issue week of 16 May 2009.

It was released as the lead [[Music download|digital]] single from the studio album on April 14, 2009 by [[Universal Motown Republic Group]], which also marks as her first single released from the label. Written and produced by Amos herself, just like the rest of the album, the song was recorded at her husband's studio in England, Martian Studios.\n\nMusically, the song is a mid-tempo [[alternative rock]] song that features a variety of [[classical music]], including influences of [[britpop]], piano rock, [[baroque pop]], [[ambient music]] and [[chamber pop]] music, along with modern electronica influences. The song's development discusses a woman who has left everything, including her family, friends and lifestyle, to start a new life with her lover. She has cited her husband as her inspiration towards the song, due to her constant move to England. Lyrical themes involve [[love]], departure and [[family]].\n\nContemporary critics were generally favorable towards the song, who commended the personal subject matter and production. However, some critics felt it lacked originality and didn't live up to expectations. Commercially, the song did not live up to expectations; The song only managed to peak inside the top ten in countries including New Zealand and the United States, where it peaked at four and ten. It did chart in Belgium, but only managed to peak at twenty-four and managed to chart outside the top 100 in Russia. To date, this is Amos' last charting single in any mainstream charts, until her 2012 single \"[[Flavor (Tori Amos song)|Flavor]]\" was released. An accompanying [[music video]] was shot for the single, which featured Amos as two characters; herself and Isabel, a character that was previously featured in her studio album, ''[[American Doll Posse]]''. The music video features her walking around iconic landmarks around London, England.\n\n==Background==\nBefore the production of the single and the studio album ''[[Abnormally Attracted to Sin]]'', ''Abnormally Attracted to Sin'' was intended to be an audio-visual project including an abundance of synchronizing visuals, and filming these ''Visualettes'' was a significant catalyst for the development of the album itself.<ref>{{cite web | last = Bryant| first = Christopher| title = From the Fringes of the Milkway: An Interview with Tori Amos | publisher = Polari| url =http://www.polarimagazine.com/interviews/fringes-of-milky-way-interview-tori-amos/| date= 2009-05-09| accessdate =2009-08-14}}</ref> Then Christian Lamb  was hired to by Amos to shoot footage of her 2007 world tour for an intended live/concert DVD.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Tori Amos Explains New Album Title, Releases New Video | publisher = www.antiMusic.com| url =http://www.antimusic.com/news/09/april/16Tori_Amos_Explains_New_Album_Title,_Releases_New_Video.shtml| date = 2009-04-16 | accessdate =2009-04-25}}</ref> However, there were disagreements between her and her record label [[Epic Records]], so she left the record label, leaving ''Visualettes'' to be postponed. She was with Epic since the release of her seventh studio album, ''[[Scarlet's Walk]]'' (2002). After her leaving of the label, Amos officially stated that from now on, she would be releasing her future studio albums and singles independently. However, the idea was then scrapped as Amos signed a new deal to [[Universal Republic Records]], making \"Welcome to England\" and ''Abnormally Attracted to Sin'' her first releases under the label.<ref name=\"Sin01\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Tori Amos to Release ABNORMALLY ATTRACTED TO SIN on May 19 | publisher = Universal Republic| url =http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090310006045&newsLang=en| date = 2009-03-10 | accessdate =2009-03-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Seattle\">{{cite web | last = Jasmin| first = Ernest| title = Tacoma News Tribune Interview (July 9, 2009) | publisher = Tacoma News Tribune| url=http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/ej/2009/07/08/tori_amos_plots_seattle_tour_launch}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the photography with her studio album, she enlisted fashion photographer Karen Collins.

Another main reason why was because Amos announced she would release her singles independently through major record labels.

She is notable for being the first [[steamship]] to cross the Atlantic Ocean, transiting mainly under sail power from May to June 1819. In spite of this historic voyage, the great space taken up by her large engine and its fuel at the expense of cargo, and the public's anxiety over embracing her  revolutionary steam power, kept ''Savannah'' from being a commercial success as a steamship. Originally laid down as a  [[packet (sea transport)|sailing packet]], she was, following a severe and unrelated reversal of the financial fortunes of her owners, converted back into a sailing ship shortly after returning from Europe.<ref name=morrison1903-407/>\n\n''Savannah'' was wrecked off [[Long Island]], New York in 1821. No other American-owned steamship would cross the Atlantic for almost thirty years after ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> pioneering voyage. Two British sidewheel steamships, Brunel's [[SS Great Western|SS ''Great Western'']] and Menzies' [[SS Sirius (1837)|SS ''Sirius'']], raced to New York in 1838, both voyages being made under steam power alone.<ref name=IP2012>{{cite web|title=Oceangoing Steamships|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/steamship-oceangoing-steamships.html|publisher=Information Please|accessdate=June 20, 2013|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''Savannah'' was laid down as a sailing packet at the New York shipyard of Fickett & Crockett. While the ship was still on the [[slipway]], Captain Moses Rogers, with the financial backing of the Savannah Steam Ship Company, purchased the vessel in order to convert it to an [[auxiliary steamship]] and gain the prestige of inaugurating the world's first transatlantic steamship service.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 617-618.</ref><ref name=morrison406>Morrison 1903, p. 406.</ref>\n\n''Savannah''  was fitted with an auxiliary steam engine and paddlewheels in addition to her sails. Moses Rogers himself supervised the installation of the machinery, while his distant cousin, and later brother-in-law, Stevens Rogers oversaw installation of the ship's rigging and sails.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nSince ''Savannah'' crossed the Atlantic mainly under sail power some sources contend that the first transatlantic steamship was the {{SS|Royal William}}, crossing in 1833. It used sail only during boiler maintenance. Another claimant is the British-built Dutch-owned ''Cura\u00e7ao'', which used steam power for several days when crossing the Atlantic both ways in 1827.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Allaire Iron Works]] of New York supplied ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[engine cylinder]],<ref>Swann, p. 5.</ref> while the rest of the engine components and running gear were manufactured by the [[Speedwell Ironworks]] of [[New Jersey]]. The 90-horsepower low-pressure engine was of the inclined direct-acting type, with a single {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=mid|-diameter}} cylinder and a 5-foot stroke. ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine and machinery were unusually large for their time, and after the ship's launch, Moses Rogers had difficulty locating a suitable boiler, rejecting several before settling on a copper model by boiler specialist [[Daniel Dod]]. The ship's [[wrought-iron]] [[paddlewheel]]s were 16 feet in diameter with eight buckets per wheel. For fuel, the vessel carried 75 tons of coal and 25 [[Cord (volume)|cords]] of wood.<ref name=morrison406/><ref name=museum618>Smithsonian, p. 618.</ref>\n[[File:Diagram of SS Savannah.jpg|thumb|left | Diagram of ''Savannah'', showing lines and sail plan.]]\nAs the ship was too small to carry much fuel, the engine was intended only for use in calm weather, when the sails were unable to provide a speed of at least four knots. In order to reduce drag and avoid damage when the engine was not in use, the paddlewheel buckets were linked by chains instead of bars,<ref>Stanton, p. 27.</ref> enabling the wheels to be folded up like fans and stored on deck. Similarly, the paddlewheel guards were made of canvas stretched over a metal frame which could also be packed away when not required.<ref name=museum618/> The whole process of retracting the wheels and guards took no more than about 15 minutes. ''Savannah'' is the only known ship to have been fitted with  retractable paddlewheels.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 629.</ref>\n\n''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> hull and rigging were constructed under the direction of Captain Stevens Rogers, who later became the ship's sailing master. The ship was full rigged like a normal sailing ship, excepting the absence of royal-masts and royals. Contemporary engravings suggest that ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> mainmast was set further astern than in normal sailing ships, in order to accommodate the engine and boiler.<ref name=museum622>Smithsonian, p. 622.</ref>\n\n===Interior===\n''Savannah'' was fitted with 32 passenger berths, with two berths in each of the 16 state rooms.<ref>Charleston Courier, April 17, 1819; quoted in Frank O. Braynard, ''S.S. Savannah the Elegant Steam Ship'' (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1963; reprint, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1988), 66 (page citations are to the reprint edition).</ref> The women's quarters were reported to be \"entirely distinct\" from the men's. Three fully furnished saloons were also provided, complete with imported carpets, curtains and hangings, and decorated with mirrors. The state rooms were large and comfortable and the interior has been described as more closely resembling a pleasure yacht than a steam packet.<ref name=museum622/>\n\n==Early service==\nWhen it became known that ''Savannah'' was intended for transatlantic service, the vessel was quickly dubbed a \"steam coffin\" in New York and Moses Rogers was unable to hire a crew there. Stevens Rogers then traveled to [[New London, Connecticut]], his hometown, where his reputation was well established, and he could find seamen prepared to serve on the vessel.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Savannah'' conducted a successful trial of approximately two hours duration in [[New York Harbor]] to test her engine on Monday March 22, 1819.<ref name=museum622/> On Sunday, March 28 at 10 a.m., ''Savannah'' sailed from New York to her operating port of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The following morning the ship got steam up for the first time at 11 a.m., but the engine was in use only half an hour before rough weather persuaded the captain to stow the paddlewheels and revert to sail power once again. The ship reached her destination April 6, having employed the engines for a total of 41\u00bd hours during the 207-hour voyage. In spite of arriving at 4 a.m., a large crowd was on hand to welcome the vessel into port.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 622-630.</ref>\n\n===Presidential excursion===\n[[File:James Monroe Portrait.jpg| thumb | upright |President [[James Monroe]] of the USA took an excursion aboard ''Savannah'' shortly before her historic voyage. ]]\nA few days after ''Savannah''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrival in Savannah Harbor, the [[President of the United States]], [[James Monroe]], visited the nearby city of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] as part of an extended tour of inspection of [[arsenal]]s, fortifications and public works along the East coast of the United States. On hearing of the visit, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s principal owner, William Scarbrough, instructed Rogers to sail north to Charleston to invite the President to return to the city of Savannah aboard the steamship.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n''Savannah'' departed under steam for Charleston on April 14, and after an overnight stopover at [[Tybee Lighthouse]], arrived at Charleston two days later. Scarbrough's invitation was sent, but as the locals objected to the President leaving South Carolina on a Georgian vessel, he pledged to visit the ship at a later date. On April 30, ''Savannah'' made steam for her home port once again, arriving there the following day after a 27-hour voyage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nOn May 7 and 8 ''Savannah'' took on coal, and on May 11, President Monroe made good on his promise and arrived to take an excursion on the ship. After the President and his entourage had been welcomed aboard, ''Savannah'' departed under steam around 8 a.m. for Tybee Lighthouse, arriving there at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., and departing for town again at 11. Monroe dined on board, expressing enthusiasm to the ship's owner, Mr. Scarbrough, over the prospect of an American vessel inaugurating the world's first transatlantic steamship service. The President was also greatly impressed by ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> machinery, and invited Scarbrough to bring the ship to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] after her transatlantic crossing so that [[United States Congress|Congress]] could inspect the vessel with a view to purchasing her for use as a cruiser against [[Cuba]]n pirates.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 630-631.</ref>\n\n==Historic transatlantic voyage==\nIn the days following Monroe's departure, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> crew, with Captain Moses Rogers in command and Stevens Rogers as sailing master, made their final preparations for the Atlantic crossing. On May 15, the ship broke free from her moorings during a squall, but apart from slight damage to her paddles, the ship was unharmed.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> owners made every effort to secure passengers and freight for the voyage, but no-one was willing to risk lives or property aboard such a novel vessel. On May 19, a late advertisement appeared in the local paper announcing the date of departure as May 20. In the event, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> departure was delayed for two days after one of her crew returned to the vessel in a highly inebriated state, fell off the gangplank and drowned. In spite of this delay however, still no passengers came forward, and the ship would make her historic voyage purely in an experimental capacity.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n===The voyage===\n[[File:SS Savannah from Chatterton.jpg|thumb|left | ''Savannah'' under both sail and steam power]]\nAfter leaving Savannah Harbor on May 22 and lingering at Tybee Lighthouse for several hours, ''Savannah'' commenced her historic voyage at 5 a.m. on Monday May 24, under both steam and sail bound for [[Liverpool, England]]. At around 8 a.m. the same day, the paddlewheels were stowed for the first time and the ship proceeded under sail. Several days later, on May 29, the schooner ''Contract'' spied a vessel \"with volumes of smoke issuing\", and assuming it was a ship on fire, pursued it for several hours but was unable to catch up. ''Contract''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> skipper eventually concluded the smoking vessel must be a steamboat crossing for Europe, exciting his admiration as \"a proud monument of [[Yankee]] skill and enterprise\".<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 631-632.</ref>\n\nOn June 2, ''Savannah'', sailing at a speed of 9 or 10 knots, passed the sailing ship ''Pluto''. After being informed by Captain Rogers that his novel vessel was functioning \"remarkably well\", the crew of ''Pluto'' gave ''Savannah'' three cheers, as \"the happiest effort of mechanical genius that ever sailed the western sea.\" ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> next recorded encounter was not until June 19, off the coast of [[Ireland]] with the cutter HMS ''Kite'', which made the same mistake as ''Contract'' three weeks earlier and chased the steamship for several hours believing it to be a sailing vessel on fire.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 632.</ref> Unable to catch the ship, ''Kite'' eventually fired several warning shots, and Captain Rogers brought his vessel to a halt, whereupon ''Kite'' caught up and its commander asked permission to inspect the ship. Permission was granted, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors are said to have been \"much gratified\" by the satisfaction of their curiosity.<ref name=museum627>Smithsonian, p. 627.</ref>\n\nOn June 18, ''Savannah'' was becalmed off [[Cork (city)|Cork]] after running out of fuel for her engine, but by June 20, the ship had made her way to Liverpool. Hundreds of boats came out to greet the unusual vessel, including a British [[sloop-of-war]], an officer from whom hailed ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> sailing master Stevens Rogers, who happened to be on deck. The ''New London Gazette'' of [[Connecticut]] later reported the encounter in the following terms:\n\n<blockquote>The officer of the boat asked [Rogers], \"Where is your master?\" to which he gave the laconic reply, \"I have no master, sir\". \"Where's your captain then?\" \"He's below; do you wish to see him?\" \"I do, sir.\" The captain, who was then below, on being called, asked what he wanted, to which he answered, \"Why do you wear that penant, sir?\" \"Because my country allows me to, sir.\" \"My commander thinks it was done to insult him, and if you don't take it down he will send a force to do it.\" Captain Rogers then exclaimed to the engineer, \"Get the hot-water engine ready.\" Although there was no such machine on board the vessel, it had the desired effect, and [[John Bull]] was glad to paddle off as fast as possible.<ref name=museum627/></blockquote>\n\nOn approaching the city, ''Savannah'' was cheered by crowds thronging the piers and the roofs of houses.<ref name=museum627/> The ship made anchor at 6 p.m. The voyage had lasted 29 days and 11 hours, during which time the vessel had employed her engine for a total of 80 hours, about 11% of the time.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 632-633.</ref>\n\n===At Liverpool===\nDuring ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> stay at Liverpool, the ship was visited by thousands of people from all walks of life, including officers of the army and navy and other \"persons of rank and influence.\" Perhaps reflecting the suspicion with which both nations still regarded one another after the recent [[War of 1812]], some suspected the ship of planning to rescue [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] from prison on the island of [[St. Helena]]; his brother Jerome had recently offered a large reward for such a service.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 628.</ref>\n\n''Savannah'' remained at Liverpool for 25 days, while the crew scraped and repainted the ship, tested the engine, and replenished fuel and supplies. On July 21 the ship departed Liverpool bound for St. Petersburg in Russia.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 634.</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\n''Savannah'' reached [[Elsinore]] (Helsingor), Denmark, on August 9, where she remained in [[quarantine]] for five days. On the 14th the ship sailed on to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, thus becoming the first steamship to enter the Baltic Sea.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Savannah'' arrived at Stockholm on August 22, and on the 28th was visited by the Prince of [[Sweden and Norway]]. On September 1, an excursion on board the ship around the local islands was arranged, which was attended by the American and other ambassadors, nobles and prominent citizens. While in port at Stockholm, the Swedish government offered to purchase the vessel, but the terms were not attractive enough for Moses Rogers and he rejected the offer. Before leaving, the [[King of Sweden]], [[Charles XIV John]], presented Rogers with the gift of a [[stone and muller]].  On September 5, ''Savannah'' departed for [[Kronstadt]], Russia, arriving there on the 9th.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 624, 634-635.</ref>\n\n===Russia===\n[[File:Rogers coffee urn.jpg|thumb|upright | The solid silver coffee urn presented by Lord Lynedoch to Moses Rogers]]\nAt Kronstadt, the [[Emperor of Russia]] came aboard ''Savannah'' and presented Captain Rogers with gifts of a gold watch<ref>Smithsonian, p. 624.</ref> and two iron chairs.  From Kronstadt, Rogers sailed on to St. Petersburg, arriving there September 13. During the journey from Liverpool to St. Petersburg, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine had its most frequent use, being employed for a total of 241 hours.\n\nAt St. Petersburg, the American ambassador to Russia extended an invitation to a number of prominent citizens to visit the ship. On September 18, 21, and 23, ''Savannah'' made several excursions under steam in the waters off St. Petersburg, with members of the Russian royal family and other noblemen, as well as army and navy officers aboard. During the ship's stay at St. Petersburg, the Russian government also offered to purchase the vessel, but again the terms were not attractive enough for Moses Rogers to accept.<ref name=museum628-636>Smithsonian, pp. 628, 634-636.</ref>\n\nOn September 27 and 28, ''Savannah'' was occupied in taking on coal and stores for her return journey to the United States. Before leaving, [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Lord Lynedoch]] of Scotland, who had travelled on board ''Savannah'' from Stockholm to St. Peterburg, presented Captain Moses Rogers and Sailing Master Stevens Rogers with a solid silver [[coffee urn]] and a gold [[snuffbox]], respectively.<ref name=museum628-636/>\n\n===Homeward crossing===\nOn September 29, ''Savannah'' sailed for Kronstadt on the first leg of her journey home. After experiencing several days of rough weather while at Kronstadt, during which the ship lost an anchor and [[hawser]], ''Savannah'' left Kronstadt under steam on October 10 bound for [[Copenhagen]], arriving on the 17th, continuing on to Helsingor to pay the Baltic exit toll, then stopping at [[Arendal]], Norway, to wait out bad weather before heading out to open sea and her homeward crossing of the Atlantic. The ship experienced gales and rough seas almost all the way back to the United States, and the engine was not employed again until reaching home waters, the crossing having taken 40 days. ''Savannah'' steamed up the [[Savannah River]] and arrived safely back at her home port at 10 a.m., November 30, six months and eight days from the date of her departure.<ref name=museum635-636>Smithsonian, pp. 635-636.</ref>\n\n==Later history==\n''Savannah'' remained at her home port until December 3, when she set sail for Washington, D.C., arriving there on the 16th. In January 1820, a great fire swept through the city of Savannah, doing severe damage to the business district.  The owners of the ''Savannah'', William Scarbrough and his partners, suffered losses in the fire and were forced to sell the ship.<ref name=museum636>Smithsonian, p. 636.</ref>\n\n''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine was removed and resold for the sum of $1,600<ref name=museum636/> to the Allaire Iron Works, which had originally built the engine cylinder. The cylinder was preserved by the proprietor of the Allaire Works, [[James P. Allaire]], and was later displayed at the [[New York Crystal Palace]] Exhibition of 1856. After removal of the engine, the ship was used as a sailing packet, operating between New York and Savannah, Georgia, until running aground along the south shore of [[Long Island]] on November 5, 1821, and subsequently breaking up.<ref name=morrison1903-407>Morrison 1903, p. 407.</ref>\n\n''Savannah'' had proven that a steamship was capable of crossing the ocean, but the public was not yet prepared to trust such means of conveyance on the open sea, and the large amount of space taken up by the engine and its fuel made the ship uneconomic in any case.<ref name=morrison1903-407/> It would be almost another 20 years before steamships began making regular crossings of the Atlantic, and another American-owned steamship would not do so until 1847, almost 30 years later.<ref name=morrison1903-408>Morrison 1903, p. 408.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Braynard, Frank O., S.S.

She is notable for being the first [[steamship]] to cross the Atlantic Ocean, transiting mainly under sail power from May to June 1819. In spite of this historic voyage, the great space taken up by her large engine and its fuel at the expense of cargo, and the public's anxiety over embracing her  revolutionary steam power, kept ''Savannah'' from being a commercial success as a steamship. Originally laid down as a  [[packet (sea transport)|sailing packet]], she was, following a severe and unrelated reversal of the financial fortunes of her owners, converted back into a sailing ship shortly after returning from Europe.<ref name=morrison1903-407/>\n\n''Savannah'' was wrecked off [[Long Island]], New York in 1821. No other American-owned steamship would cross the Atlantic for almost thirty years after ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> pioneering voyage. Two British sidewheel steamships, Brunel's [[SS Great Western|SS ''Great Western'']] and Menzies' [[SS Sirius (1837)|SS ''Sirius'']], raced to New York in 1838, both voyages being made under steam power alone.<ref name=IP2012>{{cite web|title=Oceangoing Steamships|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/steamship-oceangoing-steamships.html|publisher=Information Please|accessdate=June 20, 2013|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n''Savannah'' was laid down as a sailing packet at the New York shipyard of Fickett & Crockett. While the ship was still on the [[slipway]], Captain Moses Rogers, with the financial backing of the Savannah Steam Ship Company, purchased the vessel in order to convert it to an [[auxiliary steamship]] and gain the prestige of inaugurating the world's first transatlantic steamship service.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 617-618.</ref><ref name=morrison406>Morrison 1903, p. 406.</ref>\n\n''Savannah''  was fitted with an auxiliary steam engine and paddlewheels in addition to her sails. Moses Rogers himself supervised the installation of the machinery, while his distant cousin, and later brother-in-law, Stevens Rogers oversaw installation of the ship's rigging and sails.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\nSince ''Savannah'' crossed the Atlantic mainly under sail power some sources contend that the first transatlantic steamship was the {{SS|Royal William}}, crossing in 1833. It used sail only during boiler maintenance. Another claimant is the British-built Dutch-owned ''Cura\u00e7ao'', which used steam power for several days when crossing the Atlantic both ways in 1827.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Allaire Iron Works]] of New York supplied ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[engine cylinder]],<ref>Swann, p. 5.</ref> while the rest of the engine components and running gear were manufactured by the [[Speedwell Ironworks]] of [[New Jersey]]. The 90-horsepower low-pressure engine was of the inclined direct-acting type, with a single {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=mid|-diameter}} cylinder and a 5-foot stroke. ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine and machinery were unusually large for their time, and after the ship's launch, Moses Rogers had difficulty locating a suitable boiler, rejecting several before settling on a copper model by boiler specialist [[Daniel Dod]]. The ship's [[wrought-iron]] [[paddlewheel]]s were 16 feet in diameter with eight buckets per wheel. For fuel, the vessel carried 75 tons of coal and 25 [[Cord (volume)|cords]] of wood.<ref name=morrison406/><ref name=museum618>Smithsonian, p. 618.</ref>\n[[File:Diagram of SS Savannah.jpg|thumb|left | Diagram of ''Savannah'', showing lines and sail plan.]]\nAs the ship was too small to carry much fuel, the engine was intended only for use in calm weather, when the sails were unable to provide a speed of at least four knots. In order to reduce drag and avoid damage when the engine was not in use, the paddlewheel buckets were linked by chains instead of bars,<ref>Stanton, p. 27.</ref> enabling the wheels to be folded up like fans and stored on deck. Similarly, the paddlewheel guards were made of canvas stretched over a metal frame which could also be packed away when not required.<ref name=museum618/> The whole process of retracting the wheels and guards took no more than about 15 minutes. ''Savannah'' is the only known ship to have been fitted with  retractable paddlewheels.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 629.</ref>\n\n''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> hull and rigging were constructed under the direction of Captain Stevens Rogers, who later became the ship's sailing master. The ship was full rigged like a normal sailing ship, excepting the absence of royal-masts and royals. Contemporary engravings suggest that ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> mainmast was set further astern than in normal sailing ships, in order to accommodate the engine and boiler.<ref name=museum622>Smithsonian, p. 622.</ref>\n\n===Interior===\n''Savannah'' was fitted with 32 passenger berths, with two berths in each of the 16 state rooms.<ref>Charleston Courier, April 17, 1819; quoted in Frank O. Braynard, ''S.S. Savannah the Elegant Steam Ship'' (Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1963; reprint, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1988), 66 (page citations are to the reprint edition).</ref> The women's quarters were reported to be \"entirely distinct\" from the men's. Three fully furnished saloons were also provided, complete with imported carpets, curtains and hangings, and decorated with mirrors. The state rooms were large and comfortable and the interior has been described as more closely resembling a pleasure yacht than a steam packet.<ref name=museum622/>\n\n==Early service==\nWhen it became known that ''Savannah'' was intended for transatlantic service, the vessel was quickly dubbed a \"steam coffin\" in New York and Moses Rogers was unable to hire a crew there. Stevens Rogers then traveled to [[New London, Connecticut]], his hometown, where his reputation was well established, and he could find seamen prepared to serve on the vessel.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Savannah'' conducted a successful trial of approximately two hours duration in [[New York Harbor]] to test her engine on Monday March 22, 1819.<ref name=museum622/> On Sunday, March 28 at 10 a.m., ''Savannah'' sailed from New York to her operating port of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The following morning the ship got steam up for the first time at 11 a.m., but the engine was in use only half an hour before rough weather persuaded the captain to stow the paddlewheels and revert to sail power once again. The ship reached her destination April 6, having employed the engines for a total of 41\u00bd hours during the 207-hour voyage. In spite of arriving at 4 a.m., a large crowd was on hand to welcome the vessel into port.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 622-630.</ref>\n\n===Presidential excursion===\n[[File:James Monroe Portrait.jpg| thumb | upright |President [[James Monroe]] of the USA took an excursion aboard ''Savannah'' shortly before her historic voyage. ]]\nA few days after ''Savannah''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrival in Savannah Harbor, the [[President of the United States]], [[James Monroe]], visited the nearby city of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] as part of an extended tour of inspection of [[arsenal]]s, fortifications and public works along the East coast of the United States. On hearing of the visit, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s principal owner, William Scarbrough, instructed Rogers to sail north to Charleston to invite the President to return to the city of Savannah aboard the steamship.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n''Savannah'' departed under steam for Charleston on April 14, and after an overnight stopover at [[Tybee Lighthouse]], arrived at Charleston two days later. Scarbrough's invitation was sent, but as the locals objected to the President leaving South Carolina on a Georgian vessel, he pledged to visit the ship at a later date. On April 30, ''Savannah'' made steam for her home port once again, arriving there the following day after a 27-hour voyage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nOn May 7 and 8 ''Savannah'' took on coal, and on May 11, President Monroe made good on his promise and arrived to take an excursion on the ship. After the President and his entourage had been welcomed aboard, ''Savannah'' departed under steam around 8 a.m. for Tybee Lighthouse, arriving there at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., and departing for town again at 11. Monroe dined on board, expressing enthusiasm to the ship's owner, Mr. Scarbrough, over the prospect of an American vessel inaugurating the world's first transatlantic steamship service. The President was also greatly impressed by ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> machinery, and invited Scarbrough to bring the ship to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] after her transatlantic crossing so that [[United States Congress|Congress]] could inspect the vessel with a view to purchasing her for use as a cruiser against [[Cuba]]n pirates.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 630-631.</ref>\n\n==Historic transatlantic voyage==\nIn the days following Monroe's departure, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> crew, with Captain Moses Rogers in command and Stevens Rogers as sailing master, made their final preparations for the Atlantic crossing. On May 15, the ship broke free from her moorings during a squall, but apart from slight damage to her paddles, the ship was unharmed.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> owners made every effort to secure passengers and freight for the voyage, but no-one was willing to risk lives or property aboard such a novel vessel. On May 19, a late advertisement appeared in the local paper announcing the date of departure as May 20. In the event, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> departure was delayed for two days after one of her crew returned to the vessel in a highly inebriated state, fell off the gangplank and drowned. In spite of this delay however, still no passengers came forward, and the ship would make her historic voyage purely in an experimental capacity.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n===The voyage===\n[[File:SS Savannah from Chatterton.jpg|thumb|left | ''Savannah'' under both sail and steam power]]\nAfter leaving Savannah Harbor on May 22 and lingering at Tybee Lighthouse for several hours, ''Savannah'' commenced her historic voyage at 5 a.m. on Monday May 24, under both steam and sail bound for [[Liverpool, England]]. At around 8 a.m. the same day, the paddlewheels were stowed for the first time and the ship proceeded under sail. Several days later, on May 29, the schooner ''Contract'' spied a vessel \"with volumes of smoke issuing\", and assuming it was a ship on fire, pursued it for several hours but was unable to catch up. ''Contract''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> skipper eventually concluded the smoking vessel must be a steamboat crossing for Europe, exciting his admiration as \"a proud monument of [[Yankee]] skill and enterprise\".<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 631-632.</ref>\n\nOn June 2, ''Savannah'', sailing at a speed of 9 or 10 knots, passed the sailing ship ''Pluto''. After being informed by Captain Rogers that his novel vessel was functioning \"remarkably well\", the crew of ''Pluto'' gave ''Savannah'' three cheers, as \"the happiest effort of mechanical genius that ever sailed the western sea.\" ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> next recorded encounter was not until June 19, off the coast of [[Ireland]] with the cutter HMS ''Kite'', which made the same mistake as ''Contract'' three weeks earlier and chased the steamship for several hours believing it to be a sailing vessel on fire.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 632.</ref> Unable to catch the ship, ''Kite'' eventually fired several warning shots, and Captain Rogers brought his vessel to a halt, whereupon ''Kite'' caught up and its commander asked permission to inspect the ship. Permission was granted, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors are said to have been \"much gratified\" by the satisfaction of their curiosity.<ref name=museum627>Smithsonian, p. 627.</ref>\n\nOn June 18, ''Savannah'' was becalmed off [[Cork (city)|Cork]] after running out of fuel for her engine, but by June 20, the ship had made her way to Liverpool. Hundreds of boats came out to greet the unusual vessel, including a British [[sloop-of-war]], an officer from whom hailed ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> sailing master Stevens Rogers, who happened to be on deck. The ''New London Gazette'' of [[Connecticut]] later reported the encounter in the following terms:\n\n<blockquote>The officer of the boat asked [Rogers], \"Where is your master?\" to which he gave the laconic reply, \"I have no master, sir\". \"Where's your captain then?\" \"He's below; do you wish to see him?\" \"I do, sir.\" The captain, who was then below, on being called, asked what he wanted, to which he answered, \"Why do you wear that penant, sir?\" \"Because my country allows me to, sir.\" \"My commander thinks it was done to insult him, and if you don't take it down he will send a force to do it.\" Captain Rogers then exclaimed to the engineer, \"Get the hot-water engine ready.\" Although there was no such machine on board the vessel, it had the desired effect, and [[John Bull]] was glad to paddle off as fast as possible.<ref name=museum627/></blockquote>\n\nOn approaching the city, ''Savannah'' was cheered by crowds thronging the piers and the roofs of houses.<ref name=museum627/> The ship made anchor at 6 p.m. The voyage had lasted 29 days and 11 hours, during which time the vessel had employed her engine for a total of 80 hours, about 11% of the time.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 632-633.</ref>\n\n===At Liverpool===\nDuring ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> stay at Liverpool, the ship was visited by thousands of people from all walks of life, including officers of the army and navy and other \"persons of rank and influence.\" Perhaps reflecting the suspicion with which both nations still regarded one another after the recent [[War of 1812]], some suspected the ship of planning to rescue [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] from prison on the island of [[St. Helena]]; his brother Jerome had recently offered a large reward for such a service.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 628.</ref>\n\n''Savannah'' remained at Liverpool for 25 days, while the crew scraped and repainted the ship, tested the engine, and replenished fuel and supplies. On July 21 the ship departed Liverpool bound for St. Petersburg in Russia.<ref>Smithsonian, p. 634.</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\n''Savannah'' reached [[Elsinore]] (Helsingor), Denmark, on August 9, where she remained in [[quarantine]] for five days. On the 14th the ship sailed on to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, thus becoming the first steamship to enter the Baltic Sea.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Savannah'' arrived at Stockholm on August 22, and on the 28th was visited by the Prince of [[Sweden and Norway]]. On September 1, an excursion on board the ship around the local islands was arranged, which was attended by the American and other ambassadors, nobles and prominent citizens. While in port at Stockholm, the Swedish government offered to purchase the vessel, but the terms were not attractive enough for Moses Rogers and he rejected the offer. Before leaving, the [[King of Sweden]], [[Charles XIV John]], presented Rogers with the gift of a [[stone and muller]].  On September 5, ''Savannah'' departed for [[Kronstadt]], Russia, arriving there on the 9th.<ref>Smithsonian, pp. 624, 634-635.</ref>\n\n===Russia===\n[[File:Rogers coffee urn.jpg|thumb|upright | The solid silver coffee urn presented by Lord Lynedoch to Moses Rogers]]\nAt Kronstadt, the [[Emperor of Russia]] came aboard ''Savannah'' and presented Captain Rogers with gifts of a gold watch<ref>Smithsonian, p. 624.</ref> and two iron chairs.  From Kronstadt, Rogers sailed on to St. Petersburg, arriving there September 13. During the journey from Liverpool to St. Petersburg, ''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine had its most frequent use, being employed for a total of 241 hours.\n\nAt St. Petersburg, the American ambassador to Russia extended an invitation to a number of prominent citizens to visit the ship. On September 18, 21, and 23, ''Savannah'' made several excursions under steam in the waters off St. Petersburg, with members of the Russian royal family and other noblemen, as well as army and navy officers aboard. During the ship's stay at St. Petersburg, the Russian government also offered to purchase the vessel, but again the terms were not attractive enough for Moses Rogers to accept.<ref name=museum628-636>Smithsonian, pp. 628, 634-636.</ref>\n\nOn September 27 and 28, ''Savannah'' was occupied in taking on coal and stores for her return journey to the United States. Before leaving, [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Lord Lynedoch]] of Scotland, who had travelled on board ''Savannah'' from Stockholm to St. Peterburg, presented Captain Moses Rogers and Sailing Master Stevens Rogers with a solid silver [[coffee urn]] and a gold [[snuffbox]], respectively.<ref name=museum628-636/>\n\n===Homeward crossing===\nOn September 29, ''Savannah'' sailed for Kronstadt on the first leg of her journey home. After experiencing several days of rough weather while at Kronstadt, during which the ship lost an anchor and [[hawser]], ''Savannah'' left Kronstadt under steam on October 10 bound for [[Copenhagen]], arriving on the 17th, continuing on to Helsingor to pay the Baltic exit toll, then stopping at [[Arendal]], Norway, to wait out bad weather before heading out to open sea and her homeward crossing of the Atlantic. The ship experienced gales and rough seas almost all the way back to the United States, and the engine was not employed again until reaching home waters, the crossing having taken 40 days. ''Savannah'' steamed up the [[Savannah River]] and arrived safely back at her home port at 10 a.m., November 30, six months and eight days from the date of her departure.<ref name=museum635-636>Smithsonian, pp. 635-636.</ref>\n\n==Later history==\n''Savannah'' remained at her home port until December 3, when she set sail for Washington, D.C., arriving there on the 16th. In January 1820, a great fire swept through the city of Savannah, doing severe damage to the business district.  The owners of the ''Savannah'', William Scarbrough and his partners, suffered losses in the fire and were forced to sell the ship.<ref name=museum636>Smithsonian, p. 636.</ref>\n\n''Savannah''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> engine was removed and resold for the sum of $1,600<ref name=museum636/> to the Allaire Iron Works, which had originally built the engine cylinder. The cylinder was preserved by the proprietor of the Allaire Works, [[James P. Allaire]], and was later displayed at the [[New York Crystal Palace]] Exhibition of 1856. After removal of the engine, the ship was used as a sailing packet, operating between New York and Savannah, Georgia, until running aground along the south shore of [[Long Island]] on November 5, 1821, and subsequently breaking up.<ref name=morrison1903-407>Morrison 1903, p. 407.</ref>\n\n''Savannah'' had proven that a steamship was capable of crossing the ocean, but the public was not yet prepared to trust such means of conveyance on the open sea, and the large amount of space taken up by the engine and its fuel made the ship uneconomic in any case.<ref name=morrison1903-407/> It would be almost another 20 years before steamships began making regular crossings of the Atlantic, and another American-owned steamship would not do so until 1847, almost 30 years later.<ref name=morrison1903-408>Morrison 1903, p. 408.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*Braynard, Frank O., S.S.
