included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Men's standings==\n===Overall===\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n|\n{| cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid

included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Men's standings==\n===Overall===\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\"\n|-\n|\n{| cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid

This project, initially a [[ship breaking]] facility, was approved by [[Li Xiannian]] on January 31, 1979. In April 1979, Xi Zhongxun and other Guangdong officials presented in [[Beijing]] a proposal to give broader flexibility to the coastal provinces of Guangdong and [[Fujian]] to attract [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], with additional exemptions in four cities, namely [[Shenzhen Special Economic Zone|Shenzhen]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] region, [[Zhuhai]] and [[Shantou]] in Guangdong and [[Xiamen]] (Amoy) in Fujian Province.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business. In 1999, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the Pudong New Area came to 80 billion yuan, and the total industrial output value, 145 billion yuan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn May 2010, the PRC designated the city of [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]] a SEZ. Kashgar's annual growth rate was 17.4 percent in 2009, and Kashgar's designation has since increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Real estate in China|real estate prices]] in the city. Kashgar is close to China's border with the independent states of former [[Soviet Central Asia]] and the SEZ seeks to capitalize on international trade links between China and those states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/25/china-s-hottest-cities-and-kashgar.html|title=A New Shenzhen|author=Fish, Isaac Stone|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2011-07-29|magazine=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>\n\n== List of SEZs ==\nAs part of its economic reforms and policy of opening to the world, between 1980 and 1984 China established [[special economic zone]]s (SEZs) in [[Shantou]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Zhuhai]] in [[Guangdong]] Province and [[Xiamen]] in [[Fujian]] Province and designated the entire island province of [[Hainan]] a special economic zone.\n\nIn 1984, China opened 14 other coastal cities to overseas investment (listed north to south): [[Dalian]], [[Qinhuangdao]], [[Tianjin]], [[Yantai]], [[Qingdao]], [[Lianyungang]], [[Nantong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Ningbo]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhanjiang]], and [[Beihai]].\n\nThen, beginning in 1985, the central government expanded the coastal area by establishing the following open economic zones (listed north to south): the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Hebei]] Province (which surrounds [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]; see [[Jingjinji]]), the [[Shandong]] Peninsula, [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Xiamen]]-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in southern Fujian Province, the [[Pearl River Delta]], and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region.\n\nIn 1990, the Chinese government decided to open the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, as well as more cities in the Yang Zi River Valley.\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of border cities and all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn addition, 15 free-trade zones, 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and high-tech industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As a result, a multilevel diversified pattern of opening and integrating coastal areas with river, border, and inland areas has been formed in China.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n!

The policy change to a more liberalized economy is identified using SEZ variables as instrumental variables. The results indicate that export and [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] growth have positive and [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] effects on economic growth in these countries.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business. In 1999, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the Pudong New Area came to 80 billion yuan, and the total industrial output value, 145 billion yuan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn May 2010, the PRC designated the city of [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]] a SEZ. Kashgar's annual growth rate was 17.4 percent in 2009, and Kashgar's designation has since increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Real estate in China|real estate prices]] in the city. Kashgar is close to China's border with the independent states of former [[Soviet Central Asia]] and the SEZ seeks to capitalize on international trade links between China and those states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/25/china-s-hottest-cities-and-kashgar.html|title=A New Shenzhen|author=Fish, Isaac Stone|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2011-07-29|magazine=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>\n\n== List of SEZs ==\n\nAs part of its economic reforms and policy of opening to the world, between 1980 and 1984 China established [[special economic zone]]s (SEZs) in [[Shantou]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Zhuhai]] in [[Guangdong]] Province and [[Xiamen]] in [[Fujian]] Province and designated the entire island province of [[Hainan]] a special economic zone.\n\nIn 1984, China opened 14 other coastal cities to overseas investment (listed north to south): [[Dalian]], [[Qinhuangdao]], [[Tianjin]], [[Yantai]], [[Qingdao]], [[Lianyungang]], [[Nantong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Ningbo]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhanjiang]], and [[Beihai]].\n\nThen, beginning in 1985, the central government expanded the coastal area by establishing the following open economic zones (listed north to south): the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Hebei]] Province (which surrounds [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]; see [[Jingjinji]]), the [[Shandong]] Peninsula, [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Xiamen]]-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in southern Fujian Province, the [[Pearl River Delta]], and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region.\n\nIn 1990, the Chinese government decided to open the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, as well as more cities in the Yang Zi River Valley.\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of border cities and all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn addition, 15 free-trade zones, 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and high-tech industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As a result, a multilevel diversified pattern of opening and integrating coastal areas with river, border, and inland areas has been formed in China.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type\n!

people into their Union Square store in [[New York City]], March 18, 2020]]\n=== Lack of enforcement of self-quarantine policies ===\nSelf-quarantines for persons who test positive or are symptomatic are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]]. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], home to 25,000 [[Satmar Hasidim]], closed all 100 of its synagogues, as well as schools and ''[[mikvah]]''s on March 19, despite the centrality of religious observance in the community. It is estimated that 25\u201328 percent of its residents have tested positive, including the community's spiritual leader, Grand Rebbe [[Aaron Teitelbaum]].<ref name=\"Ha'aretz article\">{{cite news|last=Ziri|first=Danielle|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-in-america-s-only-orthodox-town-the-coronavirus-brings-unique-problems-1.8710123|title=In America's Only Orthodox Town, Coronavirus Poses Unique Challenge for Insular Jewish Community|date=March 25, 2020|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> On March 27 the county reported that Kiryas Joel, as the town of Palm Tree, had 234 confirmed cases, the most of any municipality in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=COVID-19/Coronavirus|url=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1936/Coronavirus|publisher=[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] Department of Health|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome other reports have suggested that the Hasidic community has generally been slow to implement measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. This has reportedly led to one [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]] incident. On March 23 a car dealership near Kiryas Joel refused to service a resident's car, telling him he had the virus.<ref name=\"Forward article\">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Ari|url=https://forward.com/news/national/442285/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-trump-doctor/|title=This doctor was already treating patients with Trump's 'gift from God' drug - before FDA approval|date=March 24, 2020|newspaper=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] physician, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who sees patients at his offices in both Kiryas Joel and [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], another predominantly Hasidic community in nearby [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], claims that the real infection rate in Kiryas Joel is much higher, claims that have been disputed by local authorities.

are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]]. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], home to 25,000 [[Satmar Hasidim]], closed all 100 of its synagogues, as well as schools and ''[[mikvah]]''s on March 19, despite the centrality of religious observance in the community. It is estimated that 25\u201328 percent of its residents have tested positive, including the community's spiritual leader, Grand Rebbe [[Aaron Teitelbaum]].<ref name=\"Ha'aretz article\">{{cite news|last=Ziri|first=Danielle|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-in-america-s-only-orthodox-town-the-coronavirus-brings-unique-problems-1.8710123|title=In America's Only Orthodox Town, Coronavirus Poses Unique Challenge for Insular Jewish Community|date=March 25, 2020|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> On March 27 the county reported that Kiryas Joel, as the town of Palm Tree, had 234 confirmed cases, the most of any municipality in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=COVID-19/Coronavirus|url=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1936/Coronavirus|publisher=[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] Department of Health|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome other reports have suggested that the Hasidic community has generally been slow to implement measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. This has reportedly led to one [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]] incident.

It was modeled on similar national agencies found in Europe: the French ''L'Etablissement Central de l'A\u00e9rostation Militaire'' in [[Meudon]] (now ''[[Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales]]''), the German Aerodynamic Laboratory of the University of [[G\u00f6ttingen]], and the Russian Aerodynamic Institute of Koutchino (replaced in 1918 with the [[Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI)]], which is still in existence). The most influential agency upon which the NACA was based was the British [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].\n\nIn December 1912, President [[William Howard Taft]] had appointed a National Aerodynamical Laboratory Commission chaired by [[Robert S. Woodward]], president of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. Legislation was introduced in both houses of Congress early in January 1913 to approve the commission, but when it came to a vote, the legislation was defeated.\n\n[[File:First Meeting of the NACA 1915 - GPN-2000-001571.jpg|thumb|200px|The first meeting of the NACA in 1915]]\n[[Charles D. Walcott]], secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] from 1907 to 1927, took up the effort, and in January 1915, Senator [[Benjamin R. Tillman]], and Representative [[Ernest W. Roberts]] introduced identical resolutions recommending the creation of an advisory committee as outlined by Walcott. The purpose of the committee was \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution, and to determine the problems which should be experimentally attacked and to discuss their solution and their application to practical questions.\" [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] wrote that he \"heartily [endorsed] the principle\" on which the legislation was based.

By the early 1920s, it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission: to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs. NACA researchers pursued this mission through the agency's impressive collection of in-house wind tunnels, engine test stands, and flight test facilities. Commercial and military clients were also permitted to use NACA facilities on a contract basis.\n\n;Facilities\n*[[Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] ([[Hampton, Virginia]])\n*[[Ames Aeronautical Laboratory]] ([[Moffett Field]])\n*Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory ([[Lewis Research Center]])\n*[[Muroc Flight Test Unit]] ([[Edwards Air Force Base]])\n\nIn 1922, NACA had 100 employees. By 1938, it had 426. In addition to formal assignments, staff were encouraged to pursue unauthorized \"bootleg\" research, provided that it was not too exotic. The result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs, including \"[[thin airfoil theory]]\" (1920s), \"[[NACA cowling|NACA engine cowl]]\" (1930s), the \"[[NACA airfoil]]\" series (1940s), and the \"[[area rule]]\" for supersonic aircraft (1950s). On the other hand, NACA's 1941 refusal to increase airspeed in their wind tunnels set [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] back a year in their quest to solve the problem of [[compressibility]] encountered in high speed dives made by the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].<ref>Bodie, Warren M.

It was the first of many now-famous NACA and NASA wind tunnels.

When engineers at a major engine manufacturer were having issues producing [[supercharger]]s that would allow the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] to maintain power at high altitude, a team of engineers from NACA solved the problems and created the standards and testing methods used to produce effective superchargers in the future. This enabled the B-17 to be used as a key aircraft in the war effort. The designs and information gained from NACA research on the B-17 were used in nearly every major U.S. military [[powerplant]] of the Second World War. Nearly every aircraft used some form of [[forced induction]] that relied on information developed by NACA. Because of this, U.S.-produced aircraft had a significant power advantage above 15,000 feet, which was never fully countered by Axis forces.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}<!--true, but needs citations...-->\n\nAfter the war had begun, the British government sent a request to [[North American Aviation]] for a new fighter.

The British government chose a NACA-developed airfoil for the fighter, which enabled it to perform dramatically better than previous models. This aircraft became known as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]].<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==Supersonic research==\n[[File:Bell X-1 color.jpg|thumb|The NACA XS-1 ([[Bell X-1]])]]\n[[File:NACA-Ames-1958.jpg|thumb|The NACA Scientific and Engineering Staff at the [[Ames Research Center]] in Mountain View California shortly before the dissolution of NACA and the formation of NASA in 1958.]]\nAlthough the [[Bell X-1]] was commissioned by the Air Force and flown by Air Force test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]], when it exceeded [[Speed of sound|Mach 1]] NACA was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft. NACA ran the experiments and data collection, and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from NACA engineer [[John Stack (engineer)|John Stack]], the head of NACA's  compressibility division.<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/> Compressibility is a major issue as aircraft approach Mach 1, and research into solving the problem drew heavily on information collected during previous NACA wind tunnel testing to assist Lockheed with the P-38 Lightning.\n\nThe X-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former NACA engineer working for Bell Aircraft<!--who?--> approached the Army for funding of a supersonic test aircraft. Neither the Army nor Bell had any experience in this area, so the majority of research came from the NACA Compressibility Research Division, which had been operating for more than a year by the time Bell began conceptual designs. The Compressibility Research Division also had years of additional research and data to pull from, as its head engineer <!--who? Stack?--> was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division, which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time. Due to the importance of NACA involvement, Stack was personally awarded the Collier Trophy along with the owner of Bell Aircraft and test pilot Chuck Yeager.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.89</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dryden Flight Research Center historical data |work=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |accessdate=2006-12-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013060339/http://www1.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |archivedate=October 13, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, NACA Engineer [[Richard Whitcomb]] determined the [[area rule]] that explained [[transonic]] flow over an aircraft. The first uses of this theory were on the [[Convair F-102]] project and the [[Grumman F11F|F11F Tiger]]. The F-102 was meant to be a supersonic interceptor, but it was unable to exceed the speed of sound, despite the best effort of Convair engineers. The F-102 had actually already begun production when this was discovered, so NACA engineers were sent to quickly solve the problem at hand. The production line had to be modified to allow the modification of F-102s already in production to allow them to use the area rule. (Aircraft so altered were known as \"area ruled\" aircraft.) The design changes allowed the aircraft to exceed Mach 1, but only by a small margin, as the rest of the Convair design was not optimized for this. As the F-11F was the first design to incorporate this during initial design, it was able to break the sound barrier without having to use afterburner.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, p. 146.</ref>\n\nBecause the area rule was initially classified, it took several years for Whitcomb to be recognized for his accomplishment. In 1955 he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on both the Tiger and the F-102.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy P.147</ref>\n\nThe most important design resulting from the area rule was the [[B-58 Hustler]], which was already in development at the time.

It was modeled on similar national agencies found in Europe: the French ''L'Etablissement Central de l'A\u00e9rostation Militaire'' in [[Meudon]] (now ''[[Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales]]''), the German Aerodynamic Laboratory of the University of [[G\u00f6ttingen]], and the Russian Aerodynamic Institute of Koutchino (replaced in 1918 with the [[Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute|Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI)]], which is still in existence). The most influential agency upon which the NACA was based was the British [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]].\n\nIn December 1912, President [[William Howard Taft]] had appointed a National Aerodynamical Laboratory Commission chaired by [[Robert S.

By the early 1920s, it had adopted a new and more ambitious mission: to promote military and civilian aviation through applied research that looked beyond current needs.

The result was a long string of fundamental breakthroughs, including \"[[thin airfoil theory]]\" (1920s), \"[[NACA cowling|NACA engine cowl]]\" (1930s), the \"[[NACA airfoil]]\" series (1940s), and the \"[[area rule]]\" for supersonic aircraft (1950s).

This aircraft became known as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]].<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==Supersonic research==\n[[File:Bell X-1 color.jpg|thumb|The NACA XS-1 ([[Bell X-1]])]]\n[[File:NACA-Ames-1958.jpg|thumb|The NACA Scientific and Engineering Staff at the [[Ames Research Center]] in Mountain View California shortly before the dissolution of NACA and the formation of NASA in 1958.]]\nAlthough the [[Bell X-1]] was commissioned by the Air Force and flown by Air Force test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]], when it exceeded [[Speed of sound|Mach 1]] NACA was officially in charge of the testing and development of the aircraft. NACA ran the experiments and data collection, and the bulk of the research used to develop the aircraft came from NACA engineer [[John Stack (engineer)|John Stack]], the head of NACA's  compressibility division.<ref name=\"nasa.gov\"/> Compressibility is a major issue as aircraft approach Mach 1, and research into solving the problem drew heavily on information collected during previous NACA wind tunnel testing to assist Lockheed with the P-38 Lightning.\n\nThe X-1 program was first envisioned in 1944 when a former NACA engineer working for Bell Aircraft<!--who?--> approached the Army for funding of a supersonic test aircraft. Neither the Army nor Bell had any experience in this area, so the majority of research came from the NACA Compressibility Research Division, which had been operating for more than a year by the time Bell began conceptual designs. The Compressibility Research Division also had years of additional research and data to pull from, as its head engineer <!--who? Stack?--> was previously head of the high speed wind tunnel division, which itself had nearly a decade of high speed test data by that time. Due to the importance of NACA involvement, Stack was personally awarded the Collier Trophy along with the owner of Bell Aircraft and test pilot Chuck Yeager.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.89</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dryden Flight Research Center historical data |work=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |accessdate=2006-12-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013060339/http://www1.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Dryden/40.html |archivedate=October 13, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, NACA Engineer [[Richard Whitcomb]] determined the [[area rule]] that explained [[transonic]] flow over an aircraft. The first uses of this theory were on the [[Convair F-102]] project and the [[Grumman F11F|F11F Tiger]]. The F-102 was meant to be a supersonic interceptor, but it was unable to exceed the speed of sound, despite the best effort of Convair engineers. The F-102 had actually already begun production when this was discovered, so NACA engineers were sent to quickly solve the problem at hand. The production line had to be modified to allow the modification of F-102s already in production to allow them to use the area rule. (Aircraft so altered were known as \"area ruled\" aircraft.) The design changes allowed the aircraft to exceed Mach 1, but only by a small margin, as the rest of the Convair design was not optimized for this. As the F-11F was the first design to incorporate this during initial design, it was able to break the sound barrier without having to use afterburner.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, p. 146.</ref>\n\nBecause the area rule was initially classified, it took several years for Whitcomb to be recognized for his accomplishment. In 1955 he was awarded the Collier Trophy for his work on both the Tiger and the F-102.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy P.147</ref>\n\nThe most important design resulting from the area rule was the [[B-58 Hustler]], which was already in development at the time. It was redesigned to take the area rule into effect, allowing greatly improved performance.<ref>From Engineering Science to Big Science: The NACA and NASA Collier Trophy Research Project Winners, 1998, P.147</ref> This was the first US supersonic bomber, and was capable of Mach 2 at a time when Soviet fighters had only just attained that speed months earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/b58.htm|title=B-58 Hustler Records & 15,000 miles non-stop in the SR-71|first=Leland R|last=Haynes|website=www.wvi.com|accessdate=May 8, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102022453/http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/b58.htm|archivedate=November 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The area rule concept is now used in designing all transonic and supersonic aircraft.\n\nNACA experience provided a powerful model for [[World War II]] research, the postwar government laboratories, and NACA's successor, the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).\n\nNACA also participated in development of the first aircraft to fly to the \"edge of space\", North American's [[North American X-15|X-15]].

They called out the fact that there is no stipulated liability for employers in cases of employee-to-employee harassment, something upheld in many other countries. They also viewed the provision that employers are obligated to address grievances in a timely manner at the workplace as  problematic because of potentially uncooperative employees. Furthermore, the law requires a third-party [[non-governmental organisation]] to be involved, which could make employers less comfortable in reporting grievances, due to confidentiality concerns.<ref name=\"lexology\"/>\n\nCompliance to this statute has so far been left to the vagaries of the employers and government has not taken any significant step to enforce the law so far.

The Vishaka Guidelines were certain procedures to be followed in cases of workplace sexual abuse. These guidelines were formulated after the landmark case ''[[Vishakha and others v State of Rajasthan|Vishaka and others v. State of Rajasthan]].'' This case was brought to the Supreme Court because of the sheer inability of the High Court of Rajasthan to provide justice to [[Bhanwari Devi]] who was part of Women's Development Program of the Rajasthan Government. She was brutally gang raped for stopping a child marriage being conducted in a town. This was a part of her duties as a member of the Development Program to stop any illegal activity conducted against children and women.

Penalties range from one to three years imprisonment and/or a fine.

They called out the fact that there is no stipulated liability for employers in cases of employee-to-employee harassment, something upheld in many other countries. They also viewed the provision that employers are obligated to address grievances in a timely manner at the workplace as  problematic because of potentially uncooperative employees. Furthermore, the law requires a third-party [[non-governmental organisation]] to be involved, which could make employers less comfortable in reporting grievances, due to confidentiality concerns.<ref name=\"lexology\"/>\n\nCompliance to this statute has so far been left to the vagaries of the employers and government has not taken any significant step to enforce the law so far.

Pittet (born May 23, 1975 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland) is a Professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], Senior Faculty of the Center for Systems Biology (CSB) at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) and Director of the CSB Cancer Immunology Program.\n\nMikael Pittet completed his PhD thesis in Immunology at the [[Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research]] and graduated from [[University of Lausanne]] in 2001. Following his degrees, Pittet moved to [[Boston]] (USA) where he pursued post-doctoral research at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH), [[Harvard Medical School]] (HMS) and [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] (DFCI). Pittet became Assistant Professor at HMS in 2006, Associate Professor in 2013, and Professor in 2019 (Department of Radiology). Pittet was named Samana Cay MGH Research Scholar in 2015 and appointed Director of the CSB Cancer Immunology Program in 2016. Pittet is a member of the [[Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center]] and [http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/immunology/fac/Pittet.php Immunology Program at Harvard Medical School].\n\nPittet is based at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. He is a faculty member of the Department of Radiology and of the MGH Research Institute. He serves on the editorial board of the journals ''Cell Stress''<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cell-stress.com/about-us/editorial-board/|title=Editorial Board|journal=Cell Stress}}</ref> and ''Cancer Immunology Research''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org/site/misc/edboard.xhtml|title=Editorial Board - Cancer Immunology Research|website=cancerimmunolres.aacrjournals.org}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nPittet is a widely cited researcher<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dh0LHP0AAAAJ|title=Pittet Mikael - Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.com}}</ref> in [[cancer immunology]] and [[cancer immunotherapy]], especially in the fields of [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immunity]]. His research focuses on uncovering how the immune system controls cancer and other diseases and how it can be harnessed for therapy<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0917-1006|title=Uncovering cancer: How enlisting T cells can boost the power of immunotherapy|journal=Nature Medicine | doi=10.1038/nm0917-1006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/features/macrophages-play-a-double-role-in-cancer-29875|title=Macrophages Play a Double Role in Cancer |journal=The Scientist}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07831-3|title=Cancer-promoting cells are bred in the bone |journal=Nature | doi=10.1038/d41586-017-07831-3}}</ref>.
