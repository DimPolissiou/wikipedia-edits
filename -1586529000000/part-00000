Mating occurs biannually, April\u2013June, and October\u2013December.<ref name=Radhakrishna/> Although mating occurs twice a year, lorises can only breed once a year. One estrus cycle will fail and another will begin approximately 2 weeks following. Gestation is approximately 170 days. Twins are very common among lorises. The reproductive tract and ovarian cycle reflect the general mammalian plans. As far as lactation, four teats develop and produce milk before the infant is born.

Though Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a [[Hindu denomination]], members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction from Hindu are the Ayyavazhi religion's concepts of good, evil and [[dharma]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayyavazhi Religion|url=http://www.religious-information.com/ayyavazhi-religion.html|work=religious-information.com|publisher=SBI|accessdate=29 March 2012|format=Web page}}</ref>\n\nHindus view [[Vedas]], [[Gita]], and other texts from the [[Shastra]] as canonical scriptures, instead of the [[Akilam]]. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. [[Kaliyan]] bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including [[\u0100gama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Puranas]] lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about [[Venneesan]] ''\"Avan pilathaal  vedamondruntakki\"'' (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to [[Smartism]] and its [[Advaita]] beliefs in thought\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|Buddhism and Hinduism}}\n\n===Jainism===\n{{main|Jainism and Hinduism}}\nHinduism and Jainism have a rather similar view on the topic of asceticism, or, in simpler terms, abstinence. It is thought that their beliefs on the topic come from the early belief that some meditative and monastic practices cleanse the body of impurity. The Hindu theory of Karma gave Jainism a great deal of support to start promoting asceticism. Both of these traditions attribute human greed, hatred, and delusion to the presence of impure residues (samskaras or vasanas) that must be cleansed as the individual person moves towards \"freedom\" (death). Both of these religions believe that practicing asceticism is not only to the benefit of the individual but also to the benefit of the society as a whole. Nonviolence plays a large role in both of these religions so the concept of asceticism relies greatly on both of their beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chapple|first1=Christopher|title=Asceticism and the environment|journal=Cross Currents|date=2008|volume=57|issue=4|pages=514\u2013525}}</ref>\n{{ course assignment | course = Education Program:Duquesne University/UCOR 143 Global and Cultural Perspectives (Fall 2014) | term = 2014 Q3 }}\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{Main|Hinduism and Sikhism}}\n\nThe historical interaction between [[Sikhism]] and Hinduism occurred because both were founded on the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and have the majority of their followers there.\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n===Christianity{{anchor|Hinduism and Christianity}}===\n[[Ram Mohan Roy]] criticized Christian doctrines, and asserted that how \"unreasonable\" and \"self-contradictory\" they are.<ref>\"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness.

While it is evident that a number of Indian sages visited [[Constantinople]] in Classical Antiquity, claims of significant influence in either direction have failed to gain wide acceptance. Christianity revolves heavily around the life of [[Jesus Christ]] as detailed in the Bible, whereas Hinduism is not based on any one personality or one book, but rather on the philosophy that there is a god, or no god and just self, etc. Nevertheless, some scholars have studied whether there are links between the story of Jesus and that of Krishna; \"Krishnology\" is a term coined to express these claimed theological parallels between [[Krishnaism]] and the [[Christology|Christological]] dogmas of Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Krishnology {{!}} Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing - eBooks {{!}} Read eBooks online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\nAlthough little is known of the immediate growth of the church, [[Bardesanes|Bar-Daisan]] (AD 154\u2013223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it.<ref name=\"AFM\">A.

Smith, ''Early History of India'', p.235;\nL. W. Brown, ''The Indian Christians of St. Thomas'', p.49-59.</ref>\n\nContemporary Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. Hinduism's historical tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners; this continues today. The declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' by the [[Second Vatican Council]] officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus, promoting common values between the two religions (among others). There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population, still making it the largest Christian church in India. \n(See also: [[Dalit theology]]).\n\n====Doctrine====\nBuddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit: swarga) and hell (naraka) are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed. After a soul suffers its due punishment in hell, or after a soul has enjoyed enough in heaven, it again enters the life-death cycle. There is no concept in Hinduism of a permanent hell like that in Christianity; rather, the cycle of \"karma\" takes over. Permanent heaven or bliss is \"moksha\".\n\nThe Holy [[Trinity]] of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the [[Trimurti]] of Hinduism, whose members -- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]\u2014are seen as the three principal manifestations of [[Brahman]], or Godhead. The specific formulation of this trinitarian relationship is not identical between the two religions; for example, in Hinduism there is a Parabrahma, or an ultimate creator who created the Trimurti, for which there exists no parallel in Christianity. Some consider Brahma to be more similar to the demiurge of Christian gnosticism, in that he (at least initially) wrongly thought himself as the \"Creator\" and also as the highest or even the only god. In this case, the Hindu version of the Trinity could be seen as Brahma (Father), Sankarshan or Vishnu (Holy spirit), and Mahesh or Shiva (Son; analogous to Christ).\n\nThere have been Christian writers such as the 17th century mystic Jane Leade and the 19th-20th century theologian Sergei Bulgakov, who have described the feminine Sophia (wisdom) as an aspect of the Godhead. This may serve as a rough analogue to Hinduism's description of Sita in the Ramayana, who is saved by Hanuman (an incarnation of Shiva) from the demon king Ravana to be reunited with her husband Rama, representing God. Nevertheless, although the concept that we can come to know God through ''sophia'' has played a role in Christian thought, no major Christian denominations profess Sophia as an independent aspect of God.\n\nIn Hinduism (also in [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]), the concept of [[moksha]] is akin to that of Buddhism's [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]], but some scholars further claim that it is akin as well to Christianity's doctrine of [[salvation]]. Hindu sannyasi [[Swami Tripurari]] states:<blockquote>... in theory the sinners of the world are the beneficiaries of Christ\u2019s sacrifice, but it is God the father for whose pleasure Christ underwent the crucifixion, even when the father\u2019s joy in this scenario lies in the salvation of sinners. Christ represents the intermediary between God and humanity, and his life aptly illustrates the fact that it is sacrifice by which we come to meet our maker. Thus in Christ the Divine teaches us \u201cthe way\u201d more than he does the goal. The Christ conception represents \u201cthe way\u201d in the sense that the way is sacrifice, out of which love arises. The [[Krishna]] conception represents that for which we not only should, but must sacrifice, compelled by the Godhead\u2019s irresistible attributes, etc. depicted therein.<ref>[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://harmonist.us/2009/05/christ-krishna-caitanya/ Christ, Krishna, Caitanya]'', [http://harmonist.us/ The Harmonist], May 31, 2009.{{better source|date=June 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2015}}</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Christian Ashram Movement]], a movement within [[Christianity]] in [[India]], embraces [[Vedanta]] and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu [[ashram]] model, and [[Christian monasticism]] with the Hindu ''[[sannyasa]]'' tradition. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers,(See also: [[Pierre Johanns]], [[Abhishiktananda]], [[Bede Griffiths]]). While others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{main|Hindu\u2013Islamic relations}}\n\nHindu \u2013 Islamic relations began when Islamic influence first came to be found in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the early 7th century. [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] are two of the world\u2019s four largest religions. Hinduism is the socio-religious way of life of the Hindu people of the [[Indian subcontinent]], their diaspora, and some other regions which had Hindu influence in the ancient and medieval times. Islam is a [[tawhid|strictly]] [[monotheistic]] religion in which the supreme deity is [[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}} {{transl|ar|\"the God\"}}: see [[God in Islam]]), the [[Islamic prophets|last Islamic prophet]] being [[Muhammad|Muhammad ibn Abdullah]], whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the [[Qur'an]]. Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the other [[Indian religions]], including [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. Islam shares common characteristics with [[Abrahamic religions]]\u2013those religions claiming descent from the [[prophet]] [[Abraham]]\u2013being, from oldest to youngest, [[Judaism]], Christianity, [[Islam]].\n\nThe [[Quran|Qur'an]] is the primary Islamic scripture. Muslims believe it to be the verbatim, uncreated word of Allah. Second to this in religious authority, and whence many practices of Islam derive, especially for [[Sunni]]s, are the [[Sunni]] [[Six major hadith collections|six major collections]] of [[Hadith|had\u012bth]], which are traditional records of the [[Sunnah|sayings and acts]] of [[Muhammad]]. The scriptures of Hinduism are the ''Shrutis'' (the four ''[[Veda]]s'', which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads<ref>{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus K.|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism.|year=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=0-7914-7082-2|pages=46\u201349|edition=3.}}</ref>); Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the ''[[Smritis]]'' (including the ''[[Ramayana|R\u0101m\u0101yana]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101]]'' [part of the [[Mahabharata]] cycle], and the ''[[Puranas|Pur\u0101nas]]''), which are considered to be of secondary authority and of human creation of sages but the 18 Puranas are compilation  of great Universal Wisdom,cosmic knowledge & prediction of B.C /A.D sects or religions of Present epoch 'Kaliyug' from BhavishyaPuran was destined to be true Vishnu's Divine Incarnation form KrishnaDwaipyan VedVyas 27th , Shrimad Bhagwad mahaPuran ultimately gave Peace scripted with Devoted Mind to his OriginSource of almighty Universal Supreme Krishna .The Bhagavad Gita however enjoys a special status in that, it is considered on par with the Vedas by most Hindus.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Hinduism and Judaism}}\n\nHinduism and Judaism are amongst the oldest existing religions in the world.

Though Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a [[Hindu denomination]], members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction from Hindu are the Ayyavazhi religion's concepts of good, evil and [[dharma]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayyavazhi Religion|url=http://www.religious-information.com/ayyavazhi-religion.html|work=religious-information.com|publisher=SBI|accessdate=29 March 2012|format=Web page}}</ref>\n\nHindus view [[Vedas]], [[Gita]], and other texts from the [[Shastra]] as canonical scriptures, instead of the [[Akilam]]. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. [[Kaliyan]] bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including [[\u0100gama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Puranas]] lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about [[Venneesan]] ''\"Avan pilathaal  vedamondruntakki\"'' (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to [[Smartism]] and its [[Advaita]] beliefs in thought\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|Buddhism and Hinduism}}\n\n===Jainism===\n{{main|Jainism and Hinduism}}\nHinduism and Jainism have a rather similar view on the topic of asceticism, or, in simpler terms, abstinence. It is thought that their beliefs on the topic come from the early belief that some meditative and monastic practices cleanse the body of impurity. The Hindu theory of Karma gave Jainism a great deal of support to start promoting asceticism. Both of these traditions attribute human greed, hatred, and delusion to the presence of impure residues (samskaras or vasanas) that must be cleansed as the individual person moves towards \"freedom\" (death). Both of these religions believe that practicing asceticism is not only to the benefit of the individual but also to the benefit of the society as a whole. Nonviolence plays a large role in both of these religions so the concept of asceticism relies greatly on both of their beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chapple|first1=Christopher|title=Asceticism and the environment|journal=Cross Currents|date=2008|volume=57|issue=4|pages=514\u2013525}}</ref>\n{{ course assignment | course = Education Program:Duquesne University/UCOR 143 Global and Cultural Perspectives (Fall 2014) | term = 2014 Q3 }}\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{Main|Hinduism and Sikhism}}\n\nThe historical interaction between [[Sikhism]] and Hinduism occurred because both were founded on the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and have the majority of their followers there.\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n===Christianity{{anchor|Hinduism and Christianity}}===\n[[Ram Mohan Roy]] criticized Christian doctrines, and asserted that how \"unreasonable\" and \"self-contradictory\" they are.<ref>\"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness.

While it is evident that a number of Indian sages visited [[Constantinople]] in Classical Antiquity, claims of significant influence in either direction have failed to gain wide acceptance. Christianity revolves heavily around the life of [[Jesus Christ]] as detailed in the Bible, whereas Hinduism is not based on any one personality or one book, but rather on the philosophy that there is a god, or no god and just self, etc. Nevertheless, some scholars have studied whether there are links between the story of Jesus and that of Krishna; \"Krishnology\" is a term coined to express these claimed theological parallels between [[Krishnaism]] and the [[Christology|Christological]] dogmas of Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Krishnology {{!}} Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing - eBooks {{!}} Read eBooks online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\nAlthough little is known of the immediate growth of the church, [[Bardesanes|Bar-Daisan]] (AD 154\u2013223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it.<ref name=\"AFM\">A.

Smith, ''Early History of India'', p.235;\nL. W. Brown, ''The Indian Christians of St. Thomas'', p.49-59.</ref>\n\nContemporary Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. Hinduism's historical tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners; this continues today. The declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' by the [[Second Vatican Council]] officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus, promoting common values between the two religions (among others). There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population, still making it the largest Christian church in India. \n(See also: [[Dalit theology]]).\n\n====Doctrine====\nBuddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit: swarga) and hell (naraka) are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed. After a soul suffers its due punishment in hell, or after a soul has enjoyed enough in heaven, it again enters the life-death cycle. There is no concept in Hinduism of a permanent hell like that in Christianity; rather, the cycle of \"karma\" takes over. Permanent heaven or bliss is \"moksha\".\n\nThe Holy [[Trinity]] of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the [[Trimurti]] of Hinduism, whose members -- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]\u2014are seen as the three principal manifestations of [[Brahman]], or Godhead. The specific formulation of this trinitarian relationship is not identical between the two religions; for example, in Hinduism there is a Parabrahma, or an ultimate creator who created the Trimurti, for which there exists no parallel in Christianity. Some consider Brahma to be more similar to the demiurge of Christian gnosticism, in that he (at least initially) wrongly thought himself as the \"Creator\" and also as the highest or even the only god. In this case, the Hindu version of the Trinity could be seen as Brahma (Father), Sankarshan or Vishnu (Holy spirit), and Mahesh or Shiva (Son; analogous to Christ).\n\nThere have been Christian writers such as the 17th century mystic Jane Leade and the 19th-20th century theologian Sergei Bulgakov, who have described the feminine Sophia (wisdom) as an aspect of the Godhead. This may serve as a rough analogue to Hinduism's description of Sita in the Ramayana, who is saved by Hanuman (an incarnation of Shiva) from the demon king Ravana to be reunited with her husband Rama, representing God. Nevertheless, although the concept that we can come to know God through ''sophia'' has played a role in Christian thought, no major Christian denominations profess Sophia as an independent aspect of God.\n\nIn Hinduism (also in [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]), the concept of [[moksha]] is akin to that of Buddhism's [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]], but some scholars further claim that it is akin as well to Christianity's doctrine of [[salvation]]. Hindu sannyasi [[Swami Tripurari]] states:<blockquote>... in theory the sinners of the world are the beneficiaries of Christ\u2019s sacrifice, but it is God the father for whose pleasure Christ underwent the crucifixion, even when the father\u2019s joy in this scenario lies in the salvation of sinners. Christ represents the intermediary between God and humanity, and his life aptly illustrates the fact that it is sacrifice by which we come to meet our maker. Thus in Christ the Divine teaches us \u201cthe way\u201d more than he does the goal. The Christ conception represents \u201cthe way\u201d in the sense that the way is sacrifice, out of which love arises. The [[Krishna]] conception represents that for which we not only should, but must sacrifice, compelled by the Godhead\u2019s irresistible attributes, etc. depicted therein.<ref>[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://harmonist.us/2009/05/christ-krishna-caitanya/ Christ, Krishna, Caitanya]'', [http://harmonist.us/ The Harmonist], May 31, 2009.{{better source|date=June 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2015}}</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Christian Ashram Movement]], a movement within [[Christianity]] in [[India]], embraces [[Vedanta]] and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu [[ashram]] model, and [[Christian monasticism]] with the Hindu ''[[sannyasa]]'' tradition. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers,(See also: [[Pierre Johanns]], [[Abhishiktananda]], [[Bede Griffiths]]). While others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Islam===\n{{main|Hindu\u2013Islamic relations}}\n\nHindu \u2013 Islamic relations began when Islamic influence first came to be found in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the early 7th century. [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] are two of the world\u2019s four largest religions. Hinduism is the socio-religious way of life of the Hindu people of the [[Indian subcontinent]], their diaspora, and some other regions which had Hindu influence in the ancient and medieval times. Islam is a [[tawhid|strictly]] [[monotheistic]] religion in which the supreme deity is [[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647}} {{transl|ar|\"the God\"}}: see [[God in Islam]]), the [[Islamic prophets|last Islamic prophet]] being [[Muhammad|Muhammad ibn Abdullah]], whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the [[Qur'an]]. Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the other [[Indian religions]], including [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. Islam shares common characteristics with [[Abrahamic religions]]\u2013those religions claiming descent from the [[prophet]] [[Abraham]]\u2013being, from oldest to youngest, [[Judaism]], Christianity, [[Islam]].\n\nThe [[Quran|Qur'an]] is the primary Islamic scripture. Muslims believe it to be the verbatim, uncreated word of Allah. Second to this in religious authority, and whence many practices of Islam derive, especially for [[Sunni]]s, are the [[Sunni]] [[Six major hadith collections|six major collections]] of [[Hadith|had\u012bth]], which are traditional records of the [[Sunnah|sayings and acts]] of [[Muhammad]]. The scriptures of Hinduism are the ''Shrutis'' (the four ''[[Veda]]s'', which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads<ref>{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus K.|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism.|year=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=0-7914-7082-2|pages=46\u201349|edition=3.}}</ref>); Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the ''[[Smritis]]'' (including the ''[[Ramayana|R\u0101m\u0101yana]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101]]'' [part of the [[Mahabharata]] cycle], and the ''[[Puranas|Pur\u0101nas]]''), which are considered to be of secondary authority and of human creation of sages but the 18 Puranas are compilation  of great Universal Wisdom,cosmic knowledge & prediction of B.C /A.D sects or religions of Present epoch 'Kaliyug' from BhavishyaPuran was destined to be true Vishnu's Divine Incarnation form KrishnaDwaipyan VedVyas 27th , Shrimad Bhagwad mahaPuran ultimately gave Peace scripted with Devoted Mind to his OriginSource of almighty Universal Supreme Krishna .The Bhagavad Gita however enjoys a special status in that, it is considered on par with the Vedas by most Hindus.\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Hinduism and Judaism}}\n\nHinduism and Judaism are amongst the oldest existing religions in the world.

The site was formerly a rubber plantation called Seafield Estate under the municipality of [[Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya|Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya]]. Construction work for the development of Subang Jaya (consists the neighbourhood of SS 12 - SS 19) began on 21 February 1976 and was concluded in 1988. Upon completion of Subang Jaya in the same year, Sime UEP began clearing land for the development of [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In 1999, [[Sime Darby|Sime UEP]] began the development of [[Putra Heights]] which is located on the southern end of Subang Jaya.<ref>{{Citation|title=Putra Heights|date=2018-12-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Putra_Heights&oldid=872795193|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Subang Jaya received the status of a municipality, elevating the Petaling District Council to Subang Jaya Municipal Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/drivers_urb_change/urb_infrastructure/pdf_public_private_services/BestPractice_Subang_Jaya_Recycling_Centre_Malaysia.pdf|title=Subang Jaya Municipal Council Community Recycling Centre|publisher=University College London|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Background of MPSJ Establishment|url=https://ocps.mpsj.gov.my/cms/content.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.section.Section_ecda5e03-a020f414-4600c000-538f745f|website=OFFICIAL PORTAL OF MAJLIS PERBANDARAN SUBANG JAYA|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref> The municipal comprise the areas administered by the former Petaling District Council, as well as some areas transferred from [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Puchong]] and [[Shah Alam]].

The two main exits are at exit 17.9&nbsp;km through [[Persiaran Kewajipan]] and exit 18.2&nbsp;km through [[Persiaran Tujuan]], while the alternative exit is through Persiaran Teknologi Subang at Tropicana Metropark's direct interchange.\n\n[[Persiaran Kewajipan]] and [[Persiaran Tujuan]] serve as the two major roads in Subang Jaya. The alternative route from [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]] and Subang Jaya to Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya is the [[Subang\u2013Kelana Jaya Link]], which also connects the Persiaran Kewajipan roundabout of the [[New Pantai Expressway]] {{MES-E|10}} towards the [[Subang Airport]] expressway (route 15) of [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] {{JKR|2}}.\n\nSubang Jaya's public transport system is highly developed, boasting 2 light rail transit (LRT) lines, 1 KTM commuter line, 1 BRT line, bus and taxi services. Since 30 June 2016, many new LRT stations of the extended [[Kelana Jaya Line]] have opened, connecting various areas in Subang Jaya with Kuala Lumpur city centre and [[Petaling Jaya]]. The LRT stations are strategically located within walking distance from shopping malls, commercial centres and residential areas and supported by feeder buses. The [[Kelana Jaya Line]] had been extended from the existing route from the Subang LRT Depot, running through the Dana 1 commercial centre in [[Kelana Jaya]], to Kelana Centre Point, then to [[Subang Parade]] (interchange with [[KTM]] Subang Jaya commuter station) which covers three stations within the town centre. Within USJ, the LRT line continues from SS18 to USJ 7 (Da Men and Summit), USJ Taipan, Wawasan (USJ 15), USJ 21 (One City and Main Place), and ends at the main interchange station hub in [[Putra Heights]], which connects with another LRT line, the [[Sri Petaling Line]] to [[Puchong]], [[Bukit Jalil]] and [[Sri Petaling]].\n\nOn the other hand, public bus transportation is provided by two companies, [[RapidKL]] and [[Metrobus Nationwide|Metrobus]]. These buses provide access around the town and also to Kuala Lumpur.

His wife, [[Big Barda|Barda]], and friend, [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]], are also associated with the League.\n\nThe resulting comedic tone was Giffen's idea, introducing new characterizations to old characters: Guy Gardner was now a loutish hothead, [[Booster Gold]] was greedier and more inept than he had been in [[Dan Jurgens]]' series, and Captain Marvel displayed a childlike personality.\n\nThe series would go on to become nominated as \"Best New Series\" in 1988 by the [[Harvey Award]]s, but was beat out by [[Paul Chadwick|Paul Chadwick's]] ''[[Concrete (comics)|Concrete]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey88.php|title=1988 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners|website=www.hahnlibrary.net|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> It would also feature [[Adam Hughes|Adam Hughes']] first work for a major comic publisher.\n\nThey fight the [[Champions of Angor]], other-dimensional super-heroes intent on destroying all nuclear weapons.

Miracle recognizes it as a modified New Genesis Device, and neutralizes it. They return home as heroes. Maxwell Lord introduces a proposal to get United Nations funding, and they are given sponsorship in exchange for government regulation. This plan allows them to act as an independent city-state with worldwide embassies. Captain Atom and Rocket Red #7 are added to the team by the United States and Russia respectively. Captain Marvel and Doctor Fate quit the team for personal reasons; Batman steps down as leader, appointing Martian Manhunter to replace him. They are reintroduced to the world as Justice League International.<ref>Justice League International #7</ref> Despite a series of embarrassing accidents, they successfully move in to embassies around the world. This includes Moscow, New York City and Paris.\n\nWith issue seven, the series was renamed ''Justice League International'' to reflect the team's new international status. The name change spawned the term JLI, which is used when referring to this period in Justice League history. The series was again renamed following the launch of ''Justice League Europe'' in 1989. The series would be known as ''Justice League America'' until its cancellation in 1996.\n\n===\"Justice League: Breakdowns\"===\n\"Breakdowns\" was a 16-issue crossover between the ''Justice League America'' (#53\u201360) and ''Justice League Europe'' (#29\u201336) titles, changing the tone of both series from a humorous one to a more serious one, and introducing new creative teams to both books. The major events that occurred were the following:\n\n* [[Maxwell Lord]] is initially in a coma from a failed assassination attempt. He is later possessed by JLE foe [[Dreamslayer]] of the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]]. Following the end of the \"Breakdowns\" saga, Maxwell Lord has no more mental powers, apparently drained completely when possessed by Dreamslayer.\n* [[Queen Bee (comics)|The Queen Bee]], ruler of the country Bialya, is killed in a coup d'\u00e9tat led by Sumaan Harjavti, the twin brother of the original dictator, Rumaan.\n* [[Despero]] awakens and escapes Manga Khan's starship to wreak havoc on New York City, seeking vengeance against the Justice League. A force of the Justice League's best (Martian Manhunter, Power Girl, Fire, [[Rocket Red]], Metamorpho, Flash, Guy Gardner, Major Disaster), along with the [[The Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]] (led by Booster Gold) and [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]], were unable to stop him. Ultimately, it was Kilowog and L-Ron who subdued Despero by transferring L-Ron's consciousness into the cybernetic control collar that remained around Despero's neck.\n* While possessing Maxwell Lord's body, Dreamslayer kidnaps and later murders Mitch Wacky on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey, where the Blue Beetle and Booster Gold previously attempted to open a resort called \"Club JLI.\" Using Lord's persona, Dreamslayer lures a large portion of the Justice League to the island and takes mental control of them, making them the \"new Extremists.\"\n* The [[Silver Sorceress]], one of the former [[Champions of Angor]] and a Justice League member, dies defeating Dreamslayer. Her gravesite is on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey.\n* The U.N. withdraws its support from the Justice League and it disbands. The Martian Manhunter seemingly takes a leave of absence, although he later re-emerges under the persona of [[Bloodwynd]].\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:JLI.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Justice League gets a larger roster as seen in ''Justice League International'' #24 (Feb, 1989). Cover art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] & [[Josef Rubinstein]]]]\n\nThe ''Justice League'' titles continued to expand into the early to mid-1990s. Titles included: ''Justice League America'', ''[[Justice League Europe]]'', ''[[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]'', ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' and ''Justice League Quarterly''. ''Justice League Europe'' was later retitled to become the second volume of ''Justice League International''.\n\nIn the latter part of the series, more recognizable characters, including Superman, Wonder Woman, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and Aquaman, joined, followed by lesser known characters such as [[Bloodwynd]], [[Maya (comics)|Maya]], [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]], [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], [[Tasmanian Devil (comics)|Tasmanian Devil]], and [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]]. Longtime JLI-era characters such as [[Captain Atom]], [[Martian Manhunter]], and [[Power Girl]] were revised and revamped.\n\nBy 1996, with the commercial success of the series fading, each of the titles was eventually cancelled.\n\n===Miniseries===\nIn 2003, Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire reunited for the six-issue miniseries ''Formerly Known as the Justice League''. This depicted Maxwell Lord trying to get the gang back together as ''The [[Super Buddies]]'' \u2013 a Hero-For-Hire group that operated out of a strip mall. 2005 saw a second storyline, ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League'', by the same creative team published in the pages of ''[[JLA Classified]]''. This tale told a story of the characters attempt to rescue [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] from [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]].\n\n===Return===\nFollowing ''[[Blackest Night]]'', DC launched two alternating 24-issue biweekly comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], one being ''[[Brightest Day]]'' and the other being ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', written by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Judd Winick]]. This second series features Captain Atom, Booster Gold, the new [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]] Jaime Reyes, Fire, Ice and a new Rocket Red (by the name of Gavril Ivanovich) and will, essentially, see the return of Justice League International, as explained by Giffen:<ref>{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/justice-league-international-returns-011012.html |title=JUSTICE LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL Returns in \"GENERATION LOST\" |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=January 12, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|In all of my years in comics, I have never experienced anything like the complete 180 this project took once the brainstorming kicked off. Like I said, when we started the writers' summit, the Justice League... hell, why mince words... Justice League International was not on the table. Then someone, and I really wish I remembered exactly who, stirred the JLI into the mix.}}\n\nOver the course of the series, Power Girl and Batman joined the group as well, with Wonder Woman appearing in the book's final three issues. The title was heavily tied to Winick's run on ''Power Girl'', which had the title character dealing with villains connected to Max Lord's plans in ''Generation Lost'', and eventually had her rejoin the Justice League International after a crossover between the two titles. The title also indirectly tied into ''Odyssey'', a storyline published in ''Wonder Woman'' that saw the title character being removed from history with her existence forgotten by most of her fellow heroes. This formed the basis of the book's finale, with the members of the Justice League International racing to track down Wonder Woman before Lord could find her and kill her.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/judd-winick-generation-lost-2-110323.html Newsarama.com : Generation Lost | Judd Winick | JUDD WINICK: The Future of MAX LORD & the GEN LOST GANG, p.2]</ref> Plot threads from ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' also appeared.\n\n''Generation Lost'' ended with a teaser that a new ''Justice League International'' series would be coming in a few months (with Booster Gold as leader).\n\n===''The New 52''===\n\n<!--needs updating with plot info from issues 8 to 12 and the Annual-->\nAs part of ''[[The New 52]]'', ''Justice League International'' was relaunched in September 2011, after the conclusion of the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline, written by [[Dan Jurgens]] and drawn by [[Aaron Lopresti]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=David|title=The New Justice|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/02/the-new-justice/|publisher=DC Comics|accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/07/21/live-from-the-dc-new-52-panel-updating Live From The DC New 52 Panel\u2026 Updating | Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movies and TV News and Rumors]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-take-2-justice-league-international-110817.html |title=The DCnU Take 2: Justice League International |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=August 17, 2011 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201020057/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-take-2-justice-league-international-110817.html |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 26, 2012 |quote= |df= }}</ref>\n\nThis Justice League International is formed by [[United Nations]] director Andre Briggs as a UN-controlled counterpart to the original Justice League and is based out of the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].

M. DeMatteis was paired with writer Keith Giffen and artist Kevin Maguire on a new [[Justice League]] series. However, at the time, most of the core Justice League characters were unavailable. [[Superman]] was limited to [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s [[The Man of Steel (comics)|reboot]], [[George P\u00e9rez]] was [[Publication history of Wonder Woman#Post-Crisis|relaunching]] [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Mike Baron]] was [[The Flash (comic book)#Volume 2 (1987-2006, 2007-2008)|launching]] the [[Wally West]] version of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]].\n\nAs a result, the initial team consisted of:\n* [[Batman]]: [[Denny O'Neil]], taking pity on the new creative team, allowed Batman to be used in the series.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sequart.org/magazine/16465/on-the-first-year-of-keith-giffen-and-j-m-dematteis-justice-league-international/|title=On the First Year of Keith Giffen and J.M.

He soon develops a love for Oreos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Chocos|title=Chocos|work=DC Database|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Mister Miracle]]: The world's greatest escape artist. His wife, [[Big Barda|Barda]], and friend, [[Oberon (comics)|Oberon]], are also associated with the League.\n\nThe resulting comedic tone was Giffen's idea, introducing new characterizations to old characters: Guy Gardner was now a loutish hothead, [[Booster Gold]] was greedier and more inept than he had been in [[Dan Jurgens]]' series, and Captain Marvel displayed a childlike personality.\n\nThe series would go on to become nominated as \"Best New Series\" in 1988 by the [[Harvey Award]]s, but was beat out by [[Paul Chadwick|Paul Chadwick's]] [[Concrete (comics)|Concrete]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey88.php|title=1988 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners|website=www.hahnlibrary.net|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> It would also feature [[Adam Hughes|Adam Hughes']] first work for a major comic publisher.\n\nThey fight the [[Champions of Angor]], other-dimensional super-heroes intent on destroying all nuclear weapons.

Miracle recognizes it as a modified New Genesis Device, and neutralizes it. They return home as heroes. Maxwell Lord introduces a proposal to get United Nations funding, and they are given sponsorship in exchange for government regulation. This plan allows them to act as an independent city-state with worldwide embassies. Captain Atom and Rocket Red #7 are added to the team by the United States and Russia respectively. Captain Marvel and Doctor Fate quit the team for personal reasons; Batman steps down as leader, appointing Martian Manhunter to replace him. They are reintroduced to the world as Justice League International.<ref>Justice League International #7</ref> Despite a series of embarrassing accidents, they successfully move in to embassies around the world. This includes Moscow, New York City and Paris.\n\nWith issue seven, the series was renamed ''Justice League International'' to reflect the team's new international status. The name change spawned the term JLI, which is used when referring to this period in Justice League history. The series was again renamed following the launch of ''Justice League Europe'' in 1989. The series would be known as ''Justice League America'' until its cancellation in 1996.\n\n===\"Justice League: Breakdowns\"===\n\"Breakdowns\" was a 16-issue crossover between the ''Justice League America'' (#53\u201360) and ''Justice League Europe'' (#29\u201336) titles, changing the tone of both series from a humorous one to a more serious one, and introducing new creative teams to both books. The major events that occurred were the following:\n\n* [[Maxwell Lord]] is initially in a coma from a failed assassination attempt. He is later possessed by JLE foe [[Dreamslayer]] of the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]]. Following the end of the \"Breakdowns\" saga, Maxwell Lord has no more mental powers, apparently drained completely when possessed by Dreamslayer.\n* [[Queen Bee (comics)|The Queen Bee]], ruler of the country Bialya, is killed in a coup d'\u00e9tat led by Sumaan Harjavti, the twin brother of the original dictator, Rumaan.\n* [[Despero]] awakens and escapes Manga Khan's starship to wreak havoc on New York City, seeking vengeance against the Justice League. A force of the Justice League's best (Martian Manhunter, Power Girl, Fire, [[Rocket Red]], Metamorpho, Flash, Guy Gardner, Major Disaster), along with the [[The Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]] (led by Booster Gold) and [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]], were unable to stop him. Ultimately, it was Kilowog and L-Ron who subdued Despero by transferring L-Ron's consciousness into the cybernetic control collar that remained around Despero's neck.\n* While possessing Maxwell Lord's body, Dreamslayer kidnaps and later murders Mitch Wacky on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey, where the Blue Beetle and Booster Gold previously attempted to open a resort called \"Club JLI.\" Using Lord's persona, Dreamslayer lures a large portion of the Justice League to the island and takes mental control of them, making them the \"new Extremists.\"\n* The [[Silver Sorceress]], one of the former [[Champions of Angor]] and a Justice League member, dies defeating Dreamslayer. Her gravesite is on the island of KooeyKooeyKooey.\n* The U.N. withdraws its support from the Justice League and it disbands. The Martian Manhunter seemingly takes a leave of absence, although he later re-emerges under the persona of [[Bloodwynd]].\n\n===Expansion===\n[[File:JLI.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Justice League gets a larger roster as seen in ''Justice League International'' #24 (Feb, 1989). Cover art by [[Kevin Maguire (artist)|Kevin Maguire]] & [[Josef Rubinstein]]]]\n\nThe ''Justice League'' titles continued to expand into the early to mid-1990s. Titles included: ''Justice League America'', ''[[Justice League Europe]]'', ''[[Justice League Task Force (comics)|Justice League Task Force]]'', ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' and ''Justice League Quarterly''. ''Justice League Europe'' was later retitled to become the second volume of ''Justice League International''.\n\nIn the latter part of the series, more recognizable characters, including Superman, Wonder Woman, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and Aquaman, joined, followed by lesser known characters such as [[Bloodwynd]], [[Maya (comics)|Maya]], [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]], [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], [[Tasmanian Devil (comics)|Tasmanian Devil]], and [[Triumph (comics)|Triumph]]. Longtime JLI-era characters such as [[Captain Atom]], [[Martian Manhunter]], and [[Power Girl]] were revised and revamped.\n\nBy 1996, with the commercial success of the series fading, each of the titles was eventually cancelled.\n\n===Miniseries===\nIn 2003, Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire reunited for the six-issue miniseries ''Formerly Known as the Justice League''. This depicted Maxwell Lord trying to get the gang back together as ''The [[Super Buddies]]'' \u2013 a Hero-For-Hire group that operated out of a strip mall. 2005 saw a second storyline, ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League'', by the same creative team published in the pages of ''[[JLA Classified]]''. This tale told a story of the characters attempt to rescue [[Ice (comics)|Ice]] from [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]].\n\n===Return===\nFollowing ''[[Blackest Night]]'', DC launched two alternating 24-issue biweekly comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], one being ''[[Brightest Day]]'' and the other being ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'', written by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Judd Winick]]. This second series features Captain Atom, Booster Gold, the new [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]] Jaime Reyes, Fire, Ice and a new Rocket Red (by the name of Gavril Ivanovich) and will, essentially, see the return of Justice League International, as explained by Giffen:<ref>{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/justice-league-international-returns-011012.html |title=JUSTICE LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL Returns in \"GENERATION LOST\" |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=January 12, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|In all of my years in comics, I have never experienced anything like the complete 180 this project took once the brainstorming kicked off. Like I said, when we started the writers' summit, the Justice League... hell, why mince words... Justice League International was not on the table. Then someone, and I really wish I remembered exactly who, stirred the JLI into the mix.}}\n\nOver the course of the series, Power Girl and Batman joined the group as well, with Wonder Woman appearing in the book's final three issues. The title was heavily tied to Winick's run on ''Power Girl'', which had the title character dealing with villains connected to Max Lord's plans in ''Generation Lost'', and eventually had her rejoin the Justice League International after a crossover between the two titles. The title also indirectly tied into ''Odyssey'', a storyline published in ''Wonder Woman'' that saw the title character being removed from history with her existence forgotten by most of her fellow heroes. This formed the basis of the book's finale, with the members of the Justice League International racing to track down Wonder Woman before Lord could find her and kill her.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/judd-winick-generation-lost-2-110323.html Newsarama.com : Generation Lost | Judd Winick | JUDD WINICK: The Future of MAX LORD & the GEN LOST GANG, p.2]</ref> Plot threads from ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' also appeared.\n\n''Generation Lost'' ended with a teaser that a new ''Justice League International'' series would be coming in a few months (with Booster Gold as leader).\n\n===''The New 52''===\n\n<!--needs updating with plot info from issues 8 to 12 and the Annual-->\nAs part of ''[[The New 52]]'', ''Justice League International'' was relaunched in September 2011, after the conclusion of the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline, written by [[Dan Jurgens]] and drawn by [[Aaron Lopresti]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hyde|first=David|title=The New Justice|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/02/the-new-justice/|publisher=DC Comics|accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/07/21/live-from-the-dc-new-52-panel-updating Live From The DC New 52 Panel\u2026 Updating | Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movies and TV News and Rumors]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-take-2-justice-league-international-110817.html |title=The DCnU Take 2: Justice League International |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=August 17, 2011 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201020057/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-take-2-justice-league-international-110817.html |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 26, 2012 |quote= |df= }}</ref>\n\nThis Justice League International is formed by [[United Nations]] director Andre Briggs as a UN-controlled counterpart to the original Justice League and is based out of the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].

His father was the warden of Songkhla prison, and Prem jokingly claimed to have spent most of his childhood in prison.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Warren |title=Prem Tinsulanonda |year=1997 |page=26}}</ref> Prem attended Maha Vajiravudh Secondary School in Songkhla, followed by [[Suankularb Wittayalai School]] in Bangkok. He entered the Royal Thai Army Academy (now [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy]]) in 1941. A distinguished army officer, he entered politics in 1959, as a member of the Constitution Drafting Committee. From 1968 to 1971 he was a Senator, in 1972\u201373 was a Member of Parliament, and in 1976 was appointed to the Advisory Council of Prime Minister [[Thanin Kraivichien]]. Under Prime Minister [[Kriangsak Chomanan]], he was Deputy Interior Minister in 1977\u201378 and Minister of Defence from 1979 to 1986.\n\nGeneral Prem is known for initiating the negotiations with the members of the [[Communist Party of Thailand]]. Consequently, an amnesty was declared and many communist members \u2014 including former student protesters \u2014 returned home. This helped end the fighting between the government and communist guerrillas in 1980s.\n\n==Prime Minister of Thailand (1980\u201388)==\n[[File:Prem Tinsulanoda cropped.JPG|thumb|150px|Prem Tinsulanonda on a state visit to the US, 14 April 1984.]]\n\nAfter Kriangsak retired in 1980, Prem was chosen as Prime Minister.

Prem escorted the King and Queen to [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], and began negotiating with the coup leaders. On 3 April, major leaders agreed to end their \"April Fool's Day\" coup attempt. Some were allowed to take refuge abroad.\n\nAnother coup attempt took place on 9 September 1985. Its leaders had been involved in the previous coup four years earlier. The attempt became violent when rebel soldiers fired at the government's information centres, killing an Australian journalist and his American sound man. The coup attempt was supported by [[Ekkayuth Anchanbutr]], a businessman who had fled the country after Prem's government issued new legislation against financial crime. By late afternoon of the same day, the rebels surrendered to the government. Most of its leaders, including Ekayuth, fled abroad.\n\n===Assassination attempts===\nPrem was the target of at least four assassination attempts in 1982. The investigation implicated military officers who were among the 1981 coup's leaders and former communists who opposed Prem's amnesty policy. This became one of the pretexts claimed by the coup leaders of 1991.\n\n===Negotiation with communist insurgents===\n[[File:C21120-14.jpg|thumb|US President [[Ronald Reagan]] during a working visit of Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda in the Oval Office in 1984]]\n[[File:Aankomst Thaise premier Prem Tinsumlanonda op Zestienhoven afgehaald door premie, Bestanddeelnr 933-9164.jpg|thumb|left|Prem with Dutch Prime Minister [[Ruud Lubbers]], 10 March 1987]]\n\nCommunist insurgents in Thailand, mainly led by the [[Communist Party of Thailand]], began their armed struggle in the 1960s. After the crackdown of a students' rally at [[Thammasat University]] in October 1976, communist activities in the countryside in the northeast of the country increased as students fled to join with the party. In the 1980s, Prem began changing his policy towards the communist insurgents. Previously Prem sent his men to China, persuading it to stop supporting the Communist Party of Thailand. China agreed. Prem's new policy offered amnesty to all insurgents, legally called \"the communist terrorists\". As a result, thousands of former students who had fled to the jungle left the communist strongholds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr55/fthailand1959.htm|title=Thailand Communist Insurgency 1959-Present|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Privy councillor and statesman (1988\u20132019)==\n[[File:\u0e2f\u0e1e\u0e13\u0e2f \u0e1e\u0e25\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e21 \u0e15\u0e34\u0e13\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35 .jpg|thumb|Prem as the President of Privy Council]]\nDue to political unrest in 1988, Prem dissolved parliament and called for a [[1988 Thai general election|general election]].

Prem, still influential with the armed forces, became a critic of Thaksin's choice of military commanders, especially when Thaksin named his first cousin, general [[Chaiyasith Shinawatra]], as army chief. Thaksin and his supporters immediately reacted against what they called an \"out of constitutional\" individual (Prem) \"meddling\" in Thai politics.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nAmid the tensions between Thaksin and an \"unconstitutional figure\", on 9 March 2006, a small bomb exploded outside Prem's residence in Bangkok. Two people were slightly injured, including a passing British tourist. Police said the device had been hidden beneath a stone bench near an unoccupied security booth at the entrance to the residence. The guards were inside the residence at the time. Three cars parked nearby were damaged by the blast.

In a number of public lectures, he had criticised the attempts of politicians to tighten their grip on the army, urging the public to resist corruption and vested interests. Some commentators inferred that Prem was criticising Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his administration.\n\nIn June 2006, Thaksin gave a controversial speech to officials claiming \"the intervention of an extra-constitutional power, or figure\" was seeking to damage his government. Thaksin's supporters presumed Prem was that figure, though Thaksin himself mentioned no names.\n\nFollowing the [[September 2006 military coup]], Thaksin's supporters blamed Prem, whom they decided must have been the mastermind behind the coup against Thaksin.<ref name=\"Prembehindcoup\">{{cite news|work=[[Asia Sentinel]] |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/could-thailand-be-getting-ready-to-repeat-history |title=Could Thailand be Getting Ready to Repeat History? |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=5 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825060526/http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/could-thailand-be-getting-ready-to-repeat-history |archivedate=25 August 2014 }}</ref> Prem did help secure the appointment of [[Surayud Chulanont]], another member of the King's Privy Council, as Premier, and allegedly had a say in the appointment of Surayud's Cabinet.

He entered the Royal Thai Army Academy (now [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy]]) in 1941. A distinguished army officer, he entered politics in 1959, as a member of the Constitution Drafting Committee. From 1968 to 1971 he was a Senator, in 1972\u201373 was a Member of Parliament, and in 1976 was appointed to the Advisory Council of Prime Minister [[Thanin Kraivichien]].

Prem escorted the King and Queen to [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], and began negotiating with the coup leaders. On 3 April, major leaders agreed to end their \"April Fool's Day\" coup attempt. Some were allowed to take refuge abroad.\n\nAnother coup attempt took place on 9 September 1985. Its leaders had been involved in the previous coup four years earlier. The attempt became violent when rebel soldiers fired at the government's information centres, killing an Australian journalist and his American sound man. The coup attempt was supported by [[Ekkayuth Anchanbutr]], a businessman who had fled the country after Prem's government issued new legislation against financial crime. By late afternoon of the same day, the rebels surrendered to the government. Most of its leaders, including Ekayuth, fled abroad.\n\n===Assassination attempts===\nPrem was the target of at least four assassination attempts in 1982. The investigation implicated military officers who were among the 1981 coup's leaders and former communists who opposed Prem's amnesty policy. This became one of the pretexts claimed by the coup leaders of 1991.\n\n===Negotiation with communist insurgents===\n[[File:C21120-14.jpg|thumb|US President [[Ronald Reagan]] during a working visit of Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda in the Oval Office in 1984]]\n[[File:Aankomst Thaise premier Prem Tinsumlanonda op Zestienhoven afgehaald door premie, Bestanddeelnr 933-9164.jpg|thumb|left|Prem with Dutch Prime Minister [[Ruud Lubbers]], 10 March 1987]]\n\nCommunist insurgents in Thailand, mainly led by the [[Communist Party of Thailand]], began their armed struggle in the 1960s. After the crackdown of a students' rally at [[Thammasat University]] in October 1976, communist activities in the countryside in the northeast of the country increased as students fled to join with the party. In the 1980s, Prem began changing his policy towards the communist insurgents. Previously Prem sent his men to China, persuading it to stop supporting the Communist Party of Thailand. China agreed. Prem's new policy offered amnesty to all insurgents, legally called \"the communist terrorists\". As a result, thousands of former students who had fled to the jungle left the communist strongholds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr55/fthailand1959.htm|title=Thailand Communist Insurgency 1959-Present|accessdate=20 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Privy councillor and statesman (1988\u20132019)==\n[[File:\u0e2f\u0e1e\u0e13\u0e2f \u0e1e\u0e25\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e21 \u0e15\u0e34\u0e13\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35 .jpg|thumb|Prem as the President of Privy Council]]\nDue to political unrest in 1988, Prem dissolved parliament and called for a [[1988 Thai general election|general election]].

Prem, still influential with the armed forces, became a critic of Thaksin's choice of military commanders, especially when Thaksin named his first cousin, general [[Chaiyasith Shinawatra]], as army chief. Thaksin and his supporters immediately reacted against what they called an \"out of constitutional\" individual (Prem) \"meddling\" in Thai politics.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nAmid the tensions between Thaksin and an \"unconstitutional figure\", on 9 March 2006, a small bomb exploded outside Prem's residence in Bangkok.

In a number of public lectures, he had criticised the attempts of politicians to tighten their grip on the army, urging the public to resist corruption and vested interests. Some commentators inferred that Prem was criticising Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his administration.\n\nIn June 2006, Thaksin gave a controversial speech to officials claiming \"the intervention of an extra-constitutional power, or figure\" was seeking to damage his government.

The area is part of a former Rhine flood plain in the Upper Rhine Lowlands. With a total area of 972.1 ha, Ibersheim is the fifth-largest of 13 districts of Worms; it occupies 8.9% of the total urban area. The lowest point of Worms is at 86.5 m on ''Ibersheimer W\u00f6rth''; the highest point is at 89.5 m by the graveyard.\n\nThe Ibersheim subdistrict has been part of the protected landscape ''Rheinhessisches Rheingebiet'' since 1977. Rhine floods and low flow have to be expected. The woods ''Ibersheimer W\u00e4ldchen'', on the land parcel ''Mittellache'', also called ''Mittlach'', located in a former alluvial forest, have been considered a natural monument since 1966. Other areas worthy of protection with standing water vegetation and birds are on the ''Ibersheimer W\u00f6rth''.\n\n===Water and soil===\n\nThe Rheinaue wetlands and the Old Rhine branches characterise the subdistrict.\n\nDyke breaches have formed the ''Altes Loch'' (\"Old Hole\", 15 m deep) in 1798 and the ''Neues Loch'' (\"New Hole\") in 1824 through wash-outs.\n\nThe arable land is of varying quality. The ground water is good and plentiful (water protection area III B); water levels do, however, vary. The city of Mainz has its water from its own waterworks from the area around Eich. The drinking water of Ibersheim and Hamm has come from the Eich waterworks at Ibersheimer Stra\u00dfe since 1960. On 1 July 2005, a new supply line was opened between the waterworks of Osthofen and Eich and thus Ibersheim is supplied with water of low hardness. Water supply and treatment in Eich were discontinued due to borderline water hardness. Sewage has been going to the sewage treatment plant in Worms since 1984.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe locality, like much of Rhine-Hesse, is one of the driest areas in Germany. Annual precipitation is usually below 500&nbsp;mm. Agriculture relies on artificial irrigation for more.\n\n==Religion==\n\nMany Christian denominations have had an influence on the village's cultural life over the centuries:\n\n* There has been a (Catholic) parish since the 8th century under the control successively of [[Lorsch Abbey]], the collegiate church of St. Paul in Worms, the [[Teutonic Order]], the counts of Leiningen, the counts of Sickingen and the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. In 829, Gerhelm the priest gave Lorsch Abbey \"everything that I have owned here (in Ibersheim)\".\n* From 1556, all subjects had to assume the religion of their sovereign, the Protestant Lutheran religion of the [[Otto Henry, Elector Palatine|Elector Ottheinrich]]. The denomination subsequently changed a number of times in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]].\n* From around 1650, the region was host to reformists from [[Gelderland]], religious refugees from the Archduchy of [[Innsbruck]], the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], and the free [[County of Waldeck]] as well as from the [[Electorate of Mainz]] and the [[County of Hanau]].\n* In spring of 1661, there was a major wave of economic and religious refugees from Switzerland's Z\u00fcrich region, whom the Elector allowed to settle in the region.\n* In 1671, a mass emigration of Mennonites from the Bern region occurred. Of all the Mennonites worldwide, around 10% originate in this region.\n* In 1671, a reformed church community with 50 members is mentioned.\n* In October 1693, 12 Mennonite families including 3 hereditary tenants, all of Swiss origin, went into exile to [[Friedrichstadt]] (Schleswig-Holstein), where there was a settlement of Anabaptists. They returned to Ibersheim only after the end of the War of the Palatine Succession, or the [[Nine Years' War]], in April 1698.<ref>Braun, Abraham.

Services are also held in a church in Hamm.\n\n===Religious buildings===\n\nThe following religious building are known throughout the town's long history:\n\n* St. Dionysius' church in the graveyard: first mentioned in 1252; the right of patronage lay with the collegiate church of St. Paul in Worms. After it had fallen into disrepair, the remains of the foundation were used to build the Catholic church in Eich in 1736.\n* St. Elisabeth's chapel in the castle: mentioned in 1496 at the Synod of Worms; in the Catholic church in Eich, the two patron saints of Ibersheim are immortalised on the high altar (1911).\n* Reformed church: first mentioned in 1671, with 50 members\n* Mennonite church in Ibersheim: built in 1836 for the parish that had been in existence since 1661; today, it is one of Germany's best-known Mennonite churches\n\n==Culture and places of interest==\n\n===Buildings===\n\nThe following buildings are registered for historic preservation:\n\n* Mennonite church (Kirchplatz 1): 1836, currently the only Mennonite church in Germany with a bell tower\n* Foster mother's/Almshouse (\"Ammeheisje\") (Killenfeldstra\u00dfe 6): timbered house from 1788, today it accommodates the museum of local history with \"Geldschisser\" and \"Deichschlie\u00dfe\"\n* Schafscheuern: around 1800, five barns, one of which was turned into the fire station in 1992\n\nThe designated historic district includes the entire original fortified town center and adjacent streets:\n\n* Castle ([[Electorate of the Palatinate]] administrative building) (castle courtyard/Menno-Simons-Stra\u00dfe 10): building permit 1417, conversion and extension in 1469, 1481 and after 1550, probably a large bakery for Napoleonic troops, oldest of the four castles in Worms\n* Former bridge gate to the castle with watch/signal tower with embrasures (Menno-Simons-Stra\u00dfe 12): renovated in 1771 by Daniel and Heinrich Stauffer\n* Corner house in the south east of the town fortification (Hinterhofstra\u00dfe 10): served as first shelter for the Mennonites who arrived in 1661. - In 1713 built this current building Johann Georg Brubacher (1686 - 1753), later the secretary of [[William Penn]].\n* In 1716, three barns were built as town fortification by Hans Jacob Forrer, Peter Opmann and Henrich Naef. One of three 300-year-old barns of cultural and historical value is situated along the distinctive north-east corner of the former town fortification and was converted after 2000 for commercial purposes. During the restructuring works, 17 roof windows in two sizes were put into the two roof surfaces and the outside walls were painted white. Ignorance and a lack of expert advice and collaboration between the monument protection authority and the owner resulted in cultural sacrilege, and it is likely to survive as an instance of cultural outrage.\n* The oldest surviving farm (Im Fuchseck 3) was built by Peter Opmann; the barn was built in 1716 and the house in 1717. Until the completion of the church in 1836, the house served as meeting place for the Mennonites and accommodated the village smithy until the 1950s.\n* Town fortification with ring of houses: formerly with two gates, two passageways and one gateway\n* Houses and farmstead in the old town centre (listed building zone): around 1800\n* Former distillery (Menno-Simons-Str. 8): (one of 27, around 1850), built in 1811 by Abraham Forrer and Elisabeth Bergtold\n* Thee-sided/four-sided farms Wormser/Rheind\u00fcrkheimer Stra\u00dfe: built around 1830-50\n* Inn \"Rheinischer Hof\" (Menno-Simons-Str. 19): built around 1848, sold to the municipality in 1907 by Johann Stauffer VI.\n* Birth house of Bertha Lais\u00e9 (today Hammer Stra\u00dfe 2), married to Dr. med. Adam Karrillon\n* Municipal administration, Kindergarten, practice room of the sport club: with coat of arms of Fritz Kehr, built in 1958/59\n* Cemetery hall with Dance-of-Death painting Totentanz, painting by Fritz Kehr, built 1973-75, bell tower erected in 1999.\n\n===Sport===\n\n* Sports club Ibersheim (SCI), founded in 1953, has a broad range of offers including table tennis, football, gymnastics, Ju Jutsu, cycling and singing. The club organises cultural events.\n\n===Organisations===\n\n* Spar- und Darlehnskasse eGmbH, founded in 1903; in 1970, the business fields were divided and merged with cooperatives in Hamm; then set up of a branch of Volksbank Worms-Wonnegau, Osthofen und Raiffeisen-Warengenossenschaft Hamm/Worms-Ibersheim e.G.\n* Compulsory fire brigade from 1928, volunteer fire brigade from 1936, today with youth fire brigade\n* Local SPD group, founded in 1946\n* Arbeiterwohlfahrt (workers welfare association), local group founded in 1979, with AWO Jugendwerk\n* Heimatverein e. V., founded in 1989\n* Local CDU group Rheind\u00fcrkheim-Ibersheim\n* Farmers club in the German Farmers' Union\n* Water and soil association\n* Hunting society\n\n===Events===\n\nThe local fair ([[Kirchweih]]) is held on feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]] (15 August) or on the weekend following it. The religious holiday (statutory in Catholic federal states and regions), also called \"Iwerschemer Kerb\", is mostly secular in character. Since the town's incorporation, the \"Nachkerb\" is no longer celebrated because that weekend marks the beginning of the \"Backfischfest\" (fried fish festival) in Worms, which is known throughout the region and beyond. The Kerb fair marks the end of the grain harvest and midsummer.\n\nUntil World War II, the day after [[Boxing Day]] (27 December) was known as {{lang|de|Gesindetermin}} (\"servants' day\"). In farming, this was the day when the servants were exchanged and when the craftsmen presented the farm owners with their annual bill.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[:de:Worms-Ibersheim|German Wikipedia Definition]]\n*[http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/I214.html Ibersheim (Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany) Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Rhineland-Palatinate]]\n[[Category:Worms, Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox German location\n| name = Worms-Ibersheim\n| type = Stadtteil\n| Town = [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]\n| Alternativanzeige-Gemeindename = \n| coordinates = {{coord|49|43|19|N|08|24|08|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| state = Rhineland-Palatinate\n| district = Urban districts of Germany\n| elevation = 87\n| H\u00f6he-bis = 90\n| H\u00f6he-Bezug = DE-NN\n| area = 9.721\n| population = 683 \n| Stand = 2007-12-31\n| Eingemeindungsdatum = 1969\n| postal_code = 67550\n| Postleitzahl2 = \n| area_code = 06246\n| Vorwahl2 = \n| Lagekarte = \n| Lagekarte-Beschreibung = \n}}\n\n'''Ibersheim''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8i\u02d0b\u0250sha\u028fm}}, dialect pronunciation {{IPA-dedia|\u02c8iv\u025b\u0292\u0259m|local}}) is the district of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) that is furthest from the city centre and the smallest in terms of population.\n\nThe small locality has a rich history going back 1500 years and an exemplary agriculture and is situated in a protected area of the Old Rhine.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Geographical location===\n\nIbersheim is part of the [[Wonnegau]] region and borders on the local subdistricts of Worms-[[Rheind\u00fcrkheim]], [[Osthofen]], [[Eich, Rhineland-Palatinate|Eich]] (Rhinehessen) and [[Hamm am Rhein]].\n\nIn the east, the Rhine forms a 5&nbsp;km natural subdistrict and federal state border (river kilometres 453.5 to 458.4).

After it had fallen into disrepair, the remains of the foundation were used to build the Catholic church in Eich in 1736.\n* St. Elisabeth's chapel in the castle: mentioned in 1496 at the Synod of Worms; in the Catholic church in Eich, the two patron saints of Ibersheim are immortalised on the high altar (1911).\n* Reformed church: first mentioned in 1671, with 50 members\n* Mennonite church in Ibersheim: built in 1836 for the parish that had been in existence since 1661; today, it is one of Germany's best-known Mennonite churches\n\n==Culture and places of interest==\n\n===Buildings===\n\nThe following buildings are registered for historic preservation:\n\n* Mennonite church (Kirchplatz 1): 1836, currently the only Mennonite church in Germany with a bell tower\n* Foster mother's/Almshouse (\"Ammeheisje\") (Killenfeldstra\u00dfe 6): timbered house from 1788, today it accommodates the museum of local history with \"Geldschisser\" and \"Deichschlie\u00dfe\"\n* Schafscheuern: around 1800, five barns, one of which was turned into the fire station in 1992\n\nThe designated historic district includes the entire original fortified town center and adjacent streets:\n\n* Castle ([[Electorate of the Palatinate]] administrative building) (castle courtyard/Menno-Simons-Stra\u00dfe 10): building permit 1417, conversion and extension in 1469, 1481 and after 1550, probably a large bakery for Napoleonic troops, oldest of the four castles in Worms\n* Former bridge gate to the castle with watch/signal tower with embrasures (Menno-Simons-Stra\u00dfe 12): renovated in 1771 by Daniel and Heinrich Stauffer\n* Corner house in the south east of the town fortification (Hinterhofstra\u00dfe 10): served as first shelter for the Mennonites who arrived in 1661. - In 1713 built this current building Johann Georg Brubacher (1686 - 1753), later the secretary of [[William Penn]].\n* In 1716, three barns were built as town fortification by Hans Jacob Forrer, Peter Opmann and Henrich Naef. One of three 300-year-old barns of cultural and historical value is situated along the distinctive north-east corner of the former town fortification and was converted after 2000 for commercial purposes. During the restructuring works, 17 roof windows in two sizes were put into the two roof surfaces and the outside walls were painted white. Ignorance and a lack of expert advice and collaboration between the monument protection authority and the owner resulted in cultural sacrilege, and it is likely to survive as an instance of cultural outrage.\n* The oldest surviving farm (Im Fuchseck 3) was built by Peter Opmann; the barn was built in 1716 and the house in 1717. Until the completion of the church in 1836, the house served as meeting place for the Mennonites and accommodated the village smithy until the 1950s.\n* Town fortification with ring of houses: formerly with two gates, two passageways and one gateway\n* Houses and farmstead in the old town centre (listed building zone): around 1800\n* Former distillery (Menno-Simons-Str. 8): (one of 27, around 1850), built in 1811 by Abraham Forrer and Elisabeth Bergtold\n* Thee-sided/four-sided farms Wormser/Rheind\u00fcrkheimer Stra\u00dfe: built around 1830-50\n* Inn \"Rheinischer Hof\" (Menno-Simons-Str. 19): built around 1848, sold to the municipality in 1907 by Johann Stauffer VI.\n* Birth house of Bertha Lais\u00e9 (today Hammer Stra\u00dfe 2), married to Dr. med. Adam Karrillon\n* Municipal administration, Kindergarten, practice room of the sport club: with coat of arms of Fritz Kehr, built in 1958/59\n* Cemetery hall with Dance-of-Death painting Totentanz, painting by Fritz Kehr, built 1973-75, bell tower erected in 1999.\n\n===Sport===\n\n* Sports club Ibersheim (SCI), founded in 1953, has a broad range of offers including table tennis, football, gymnastics, Ju Jutsu, cycling and singing. The club organises cultural events.\n\n===Organisations===\n\n* Spar- und Darlehnskasse eGmbH, founded in 1903; in 1970, the business fields were divided and merged with cooperatives in Hamm; then set up of a branch of Volksbank Worms-Wonnegau, Osthofen und Raiffeisen-Warengenossenschaft Hamm/Worms-Ibersheim e.G.\n* Compulsory fire brigade from 1928, volunteer fire brigade from 1936, today with youth fire brigade\n* Local SPD group, founded in 1946\n* Arbeiterwohlfahrt (workers welfare association), local group founded in 1979, with AWO Jugendwerk\n* Heimatverein e. V., founded in 1989\n* Local CDU group Rheind\u00fcrkheim-Ibersheim\n* Farmers club in the German Farmers' Union\n* Water and soil association\n* Hunting society\n\n===Events===\n\nThe local fair ([[Kirchweih]]) is held on feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]] (15 August) or on the weekend following it. The religious holiday (statutory in Catholic federal states and regions), also called \"Iwerschemer Kerb\", is mostly secular in character. Since the town's incorporation, the \"Nachkerb\" is no longer celebrated because that weekend marks the beginning of the \"Backfischfest\" (fried fish festival) in Worms, which is known throughout the region and beyond. The Kerb fair marks the end of the grain harvest and midsummer.\n\nUntil World War II, the day after [[Boxing Day]] (27 December) was known as {{lang|de|Gesindetermin}} (\"servants' day\"). In farming, this was the day when the servants were exchanged and when the craftsmen presented the farm owners with their annual bill.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[:de:Worms-Ibersheim|German Wikipedia Definition]]\n*[http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/I214.html Ibersheim (Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany) Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Rhineland-Palatinate]]\n[[Category:Worms, Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibersheim"}

The story follows a young prince who visits various planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss.

As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]], and, one day, his plane crashes in the [[Sahara]], far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. \n\nIn the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as \"the little prince\". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\nUpon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\nOver the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life.\n\nThe prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized [[asteroid]] known as \"[[B 612 (The Little Prince)|B 612]]\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule [[volcano]]es (two active, and one [[volcano#volcano activity|dormant or extinct]]) as well as a variety of plants.\n\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out [[baobab]] trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognized, it may be put off until it is too late and the tree has grown too large to remove, its roots having a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet.\n\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and attended her, making a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind, watering her, and keeping off the caterpillars.\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose is serious and apologizes that she failed to show she loved him and that they'd both been silly. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself.\n\nThe prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\nThe prince has since visited six other [[planet]]s, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that can be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A narcissistic man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most-admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing [[economic materialism|materialism]])\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following [[Obedience (human behaviour)|orders]] to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly [[geographer]] who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of [[Interdisciplinarity|specialization]] in the contemporary world.\n \nIt is the [[geographer]] who tells the prince that his rose is an ''[[ephemeral]]'' being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet [[Earth]].\n\nThe visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity.  The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world.  On earth there were<blockquote>111 kings&nbsp;... 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</blockquote>Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and that she had lied. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He lay down on the grass and wept, until a [[fennec fox|fox]] came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and teaches the prince how to tame him.\n\nBy being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others, to be special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden.\n\nUpon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince finally meets two people from Earth:\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. \n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, whom he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home, or died.\n\nThe story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n== Tone and writing style ==   <!--[ in work, assistance will be appreciated! ]-->\n\nThe story of ''The Little Prince'' is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"<ref name=\"Shmoop.a\" /> ''The Little Prince'' was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an expatriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements....

In 1942 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry related to his American English teacher, Ad\u00e8le Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy,\" until he instantaneously dozed off.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.<ref>Webster 1993, p. 246.</ref>\n\nThough the story is more or less understandable, the narrator made almost no connection from when the little prince traveled between planets, he purposefully did that so that the book felt like it was told from a secretive little boy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAlthough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a master of the French language, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Ad\u00e8le Breaux, his young [[Northport, New York|Northport]] English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Ad\u00e8le Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\") related her experiences with her famous student as ''Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942\u20131943: A Memoir'', published in 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tu5cAAAAMAAJ|title=Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942-1943: a memoir|last=Breaux|first=Ad\u00e8le|date=June 1971|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=9780838676103}}</ref>\n\n\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his [[ground crew]] would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined ''carnet'' (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006}}{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=251 & 260}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\n=== Events and characters ===\n[[File:Sahara Crash -1935- copyright free in Egypt 3634 StEx 1 -cropped.jpg|thumb| right |Saint-Exup\u00e9ry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3&nbsp;am during an air race to [[Saigon]], Vietnam.

Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see [[mirage]]s, which were quickly followed by more vivid [[hallucination]]s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a [[Bedouin]] on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" />\n\nThe prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", was likely derived as a progression of one of the planes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew as an airmail pilot, which bore the serial number \"A-612\". During his service as a mail pilot in the Sahara, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had viewed a [[fennec fox|fennec]] (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara's [[Cape Juby]], where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec that he adored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modeled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\nThe fearsome, grasping [[baobab]] trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent [[Nazism]] attempting to destroy the planet.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".<ref name=\"AirmansOdyssey\" />\n\n=== Rose ===\n[[File:Consuelo en 1942 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.jpg|thumb|right| 200px |The Rose in ''The Little Prince'' was likely inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo (Montreal, 1942).]]\nMany researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted but petulant and vain rose was inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's [[Salvadoran]] wife [[Consuelo de Saint Exup\u00e9ry]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=248\u2013251}} with the small home planet being inspired by her small native country, [[El Salvador]], also known as \"The Land of Volcanoes.\"{{sfnp|Saint Exup\u00e9ry, Consuelo de|2003}} Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in ''The Little Prince.'' \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words,\" says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n=== Prince ===\n[[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] may have drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him ''le Roi-Soleil'' (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in [[Quebec City]] in 1942, [[Thomas De Koninck]], the son of philosopher [[Charles De Koninck]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=378}}{{sfnp|Brown|2004|}}<ref name=\"La Presse-2013.09.13\" /> Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] Jr. and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he met during an overnight stay at their [[Long Island]] home in 1939.{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />{{refn|\n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how [[Adolf Hitler]] and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.<ref name=\"BestNotes.com-a\" /> When [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] photojournalist [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]] questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was,\" he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" />\n\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for ''[[Paris-Soir]],'' the author described traveling from France to the [[USSR]] by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-Sense.of.Life\" />\n\n{{quote|I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple.

He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States (Quebec, 1942).]]\n\nUpon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, he initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the ''[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> After France's defeat in 1940 and its [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany]], he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis forces]], and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the [[French Resistance]]. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in ''The Little Prince''.\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent [[Gaullism|French Gaullist]] and [[Vichy France]].<ref>Webster 1993, pp. 238\u2013242.</ref> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" />\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on [[Central Park South]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1989-05-12\" /> then the [[Delamater-Bevin Mansion|Bevin House]] mansion in [[Asharoken, New York]], and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=380}}<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />\n\nThe couple also stayed in [[Quebec]] for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided.<ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Hannibal\" /><ref name=\"Chesterton\" /><ref name=\"QuebecVille\" /> During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]].{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]]. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=278}}{{refn|\n \nAnother source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: [[P. L. Travers]], the author of the popular children's books series on ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'', was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as ''The Little Prince''. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n\n|group=\"Note\"|}} The author wrote and illustrated ''The Little Prince'' at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of [[Asharoken, New York|Asharoken]] in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006b\" />\n\n[[File:BevinFront.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bevin House]] on [[Long Island]], one of the locations in which ''The Little Prince'' was written during the summer and fall of 1942.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />]]\n\nAlthough the book was started in his [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in [[Westport, Connecticut]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked [[Long Island Sound]].

One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour [[Denis de Rougemont]], who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, ''The Tale of the Rose'', as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] which had obtained Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.<ref name=\"Fast Company\" />  The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nThe large white [[Second French Empire]]-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book'', where the prince'' visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />{{refn|\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Manuscript ===\n\nThe original 140-page [[manuscript|autograph manuscript]] of ''The Little Prince'', along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now [[The Morgan Library & Museum]]) in [[Manhattan]], New York City.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.09\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.17\" /> It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was [[Strikethrough|struck-through]] and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several [[watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]] by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s literary works.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /> Physically, the manuscript's [[Onionskin|onion skin media]] has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" />\n\nThe story's keynote [[aphorism]], {{lang|fr|On ne voit bien qu'avec le c\u0153ur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux}} (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing.  Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a [[Dictaphone]] recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /> His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" />\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Long Island]]. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid.  Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls.  Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page [[epilogue]] lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\n{{Further|#Morgan exhibitions {{!}} Morgan exhibitions}}\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling',\" he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.<ref name=\"Guardian-2012.05.04\"/><ref name=AssociatedPress-2012.05.03 />\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met [[L\u00e9on Werth]] (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Aeropostale]] associates.  Werth was an anarchist, a leftist [[Bolshevik]] supporter [[Jew|of Jewish descent]], twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, ''{{interlanguage link|Lettre \u00e0 un otage|fr}}'' (''Letter to a Hostage'') and ''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince''), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing ''The Little Prince'', Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in [[Saint-Amour, Jura|Saint-Amour]], his village in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]], a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.a\" />{{quote|\n\nTo Leon Werth\n\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:\n\nTo Leon Werth,<br />\nWhen he was a little boy|}}\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of ''The Little Prince,'' in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.<ref>Heur\u00e9 (2006), p. 272.</ref> At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant [[Watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]], which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.{{refn|\n\nOn one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} Two or three original ''Little Prince'' drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker [[Joseph Cornell]].<ref name=\"Life-1967.12.15\" /> One rare original ''Little Prince'' watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.<ref name=\"Globe&Mail-2006-04-07\" /><ref name=\"CBC-2007.04.07\" />\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in [[Robert Crumb]]'s later famous [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']] of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince,\" and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.  One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of ''The Little Prince's'' publication, the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a [[Free French Air Force]] pilot.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-2014.01.24\" /> Hamilton's black [[poodle]], Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a [[Raggedy Ann]] type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> Additionally, a pet [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]], Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" /> A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place.

Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"<ref name=\"EphemeralPursuits\" /> Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for ''Le Petit Prince'' deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], plus the star [[Aldebaran]], arranged as an [[Scalene triangle|isosceles triangle]], a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.<ref name=\"Shimbun\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master [[Celestial navigation|celestial navigator]], a vocation he had studied at [[Salon-de-Provence Air Base|Salon-de-Provence]] with the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']] (French Air Force).\n\n=== Post-publication ===\n\n[[Stacy Schiff]], one of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" /> Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-2004.04.11\" />\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the [[Free French Forces]]. He would remain immensely proud of ''The Little Prince'', and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" />\n\n{{Further|Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance {{!}} Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 Disappearance}}\n\nAs part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.{{refn|\n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]], a fluently bilingual ''[[Life Magazine]]'' correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006|p=421}} Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the ''Life Magazine'' request to General Eaker.

His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with ''[[Life Magazine]]'', were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.<ref name=\"Eyheramonno\" /> For some time Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book?....  ...''The Little Prince'', which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10.

It was first published in English and French in the US by [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] in April 1943, and posthumously in France following the [[liberation of France]] as Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the [[Vichy Regime]].

As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]], and, one day, his plane crashes in the [[Sahara]], far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. \n\nIn the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as \"the little prince\". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\nUpon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\nOver the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life.\n\nThe prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized [[asteroid]] known as \"[[B 612 (The Little Prince)|B 612]]\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule [[volcano]]es (two active, and one [[volcano#volcano activity|dormant or extinct]]) as well as a variety of plants.\n\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out [[baobab]] trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognized, it may be put off until it is too late and the tree has grown too large to remove, its roots having a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet.\n\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and attended her, making a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind, watering her, and keeping off the caterpillars.\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose is serious and apologizes that she failed to show she loved him and that they'd both been silly. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself.\n\nThe prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\nThe prince has since visited six other [[planet]]s, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that can be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A narcissistic man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most-admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing [[economic materialism|materialism]])\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following [[Obedience (human behaviour)|orders]] to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly [[geographer]] who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of [[Interdisciplinarity|specialization]] in the contemporary world.\n \nIt is the [[geographer]] who tells the prince that his rose is an ''[[ephemeral]]'' being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet [[Earth]].\n\nThe visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity.  The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world.  On earth there were<blockquote>111 kings&nbsp;... 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</blockquote>Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and that she had lied. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He lay down on the grass and wept, until a [[fennec fox|fox]] came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and teaches the prince how to tame him.\n\nBy being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others, to be special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden.\n\nUpon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince finally meets two people from Earth:\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. \n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, whom he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home, or died.\n\nThe story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n== Tone and writing style ==   <!--[ in work, assistance will be appreciated! ]-->\n\nThe story of ''The Little Prince'' is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"<ref name=\"Shmoop.a\" /> ''The Little Prince'' was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an expatriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements....

Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his [[ground crew]] would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined ''carnet'' (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006}}{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=251 & 260}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\n=== Events and characters ===\n[[File:Sahara Crash -1935- copyright free in Egypt 3634 StEx 1 -cropped.jpg|thumb| right |Saint-Exup\u00e9ry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3&nbsp;am during an air race to [[Saigon]], Vietnam.

The account clearly drew on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' (original French: {{lang|fr|Terre des hommes}}).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 02:45&nbsp;am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his copilot-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Sahara desert.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=258}} They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a ''raid'', that had a prize of 150,000&nbsp;[[francs]].<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" /> Their plane was a [[Caudron]] [[Caudron Simoun|C-630 Simoun]],{{refn|\n\nThe plane Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a [[Caudron]] C-630 [[Caudron Simoun|Simoun]], Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exup\u00e9RY).\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} and the crash site is thought to have been near to the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] valley, close to the [[Nile Delta]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=263}}\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.<ref name=\"Science and Diplomacy.\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/international-atomic-energy-agency |journal=Science and Diplomacy|date=22 June 2015 |title=The International Atomic Energy Agency: Linking Nuclear Science and Diplomacy |first=John |last=Brittain}}</ref> Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see [[mirage]]s, which were quickly followed by more vivid [[hallucination]]s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a [[Bedouin]] on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" />\n\nThe prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", was likely derived as a progression of one of the planes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew as an airmail pilot, which bore the serial number \"A-612\". During his service as a mail pilot in the Sahara, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had viewed a [[fennec fox|fennec]] (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara's [[Cape Juby]], where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec that he adored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modeled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\nThe fearsome, grasping [[baobab]] trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent [[Nazism]] attempting to destroy the planet.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry.

Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in ''The Little Prince.'' \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words,\" says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me.

The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in [[Quebec City]] in 1942, [[Thomas De Koninck]], the son of philosopher [[Charles De Koninck]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=378}}{{sfnp|Brown|2004|}}<ref name=\"La Presse-2013.09.13\" /> Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] Jr. and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he met during an overnight stay at their [[Long Island]] home in 1939.{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />{{refn|\n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how [[Adolf Hitler]] and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.<ref name=\"BestNotes.com-a\" /> When [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] photojournalist [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]] questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was,\" he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" />\n\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for ''[[Paris-Soir]],'' the author described traveling from France to the [[USSR]] by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-Sense.of.Life\" />\n\n{{quote|I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple.

His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis forces]], and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the [[French Resistance]]. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in ''The Little Prince''.\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife.

The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=278}}{{refn|\n \nAnother source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: [[P.

On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.<ref name=\"Fast Company\" />  The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nThe large white [[Second French Empire]]-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book'', where the prince'' visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />{{refn|\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Manuscript ===\n\nThe original 140-page [[manuscript|autograph manuscript]] of ''The Little Prince'', along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now [[The Morgan Library & Museum]]) in [[Manhattan]], New York City.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.09\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.17\" /> It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was [[Strikethrough|struck-through]] and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several [[watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]] by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s literary works.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /> Physically, the manuscript's [[Onionskin|onion skin media]] has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" />\n\nThe story's keynote [[aphorism]], {{lang|fr|On ne voit bien qu'avec le c\u0153ur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux}} (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing.  Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a [[Dictaphone]] recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /> His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" />\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Long Island]]. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid.  Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls.  Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page [[epilogue]] lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\n{{Further|#Morgan exhibitions {{!}} Morgan exhibitions}}\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling',\" he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.<ref name=\"Guardian-2012.05.04\"/><ref name=AssociatedPress-2012.05.03 />\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met [[L\u00e9on Werth]] (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Aeropostale]] associates.  Werth was an anarchist, a leftist [[Bolshevik]] supporter [[Jew|of Jewish descent]], twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, ''{{interlanguage link|Lettre \u00e0 un otage|fr}}'' (''Letter to a Hostage'') and ''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince''), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing ''The Little Prince'', Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in [[Saint-Amour, Jura|Saint-Amour]], his village in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]], a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.a\" />{{quote|\n\nTo Leon Werth\n\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:\n\nTo Leon Werth,<br />\nWhen he was a little boy|}}\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of ''The Little Prince,'' in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.<ref>Heur\u00e9 (2006), p. 272.</ref> At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant [[Watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]], which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.{{refn|\n\nOn one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} Two or three original ''Little Prince'' drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker [[Joseph Cornell]].<ref name=\"Life-1967.12.15\" /> One rare original ''Little Prince'' watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.<ref name=\"Globe&Mail-2006-04-07\" /><ref name=\"CBC-2007.04.07\" />\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in [[Robert Crumb]]'s later famous [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']] of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince,\" and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.  One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of ''The Little Prince's'' publication, the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a [[Free French Air Force]] pilot.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-2014.01.24\" /> Hamilton's black [[poodle]], Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a [[Raggedy Ann]] type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> Additionally, a pet [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]], Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" /> A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"<ref name=\"EphemeralPursuits\" /> Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for ''Le Petit Prince'' deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], plus the star [[Aldebaran]], arranged as an [[Scalene triangle|isosceles triangle]], a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.<ref name=\"Shimbun\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master [[Celestial navigation|celestial navigator]], a vocation he had studied at [[Salon-de-Provence Air Base|Salon-de-Provence]] with the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']] (French Air Force).\n\n=== Post-publication ===\n\n[[Stacy Schiff]], one of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" /> Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-2004.04.11\" />\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the [[Free French Forces]]. He would remain immensely proud of ''The Little Prince'', and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" />\n\n{{Further|Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance {{!}} Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 Disappearance}}\n\nAs part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.{{refn|\n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]], a fluently bilingual ''[[Life Magazine]]'' correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006|p=421}} Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the ''Life Magazine'' request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance|lost in action]] during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of [[Corsica]] to [[Continental Europe|the continent]] in preparation for the [[Operation Dragoon|Allied invasion of occupied France]], only three weeks before the [[Liberation of Paris]].<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />{{refn|\n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with ''[[Life Magazine]]'', were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.<ref name=\"Eyheramonno\" /> For some time Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book?....  ...''The Little Prince'', which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\"  Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1943.04.06\" /> Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of ''The New York Times'', stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of [[credo]].\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> [[P. L. Travers|P.L. Travers]], author of the [[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]] series of children books, wrote in a ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' review: \"''The Little Prince'' will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.b\" />\n\nBritish journalist Neil Clark, in ''[[The American Conservative]]'' in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"\u2026bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"<ref name=\"American Conservative-2009.10\" />\n\nThe book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for only two weeks,<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" /> as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' which remained on the same list for nearly five months.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning [[List of The Little Prince adaptations|numerous adaptations]].

It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like [[Mayan languages|Maya]] (2001), [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (2006) or [[Banat Bulgarian dialect|Banat Bulgarian]] (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into [[Latin]], as ''Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt''<ref name=\"Hinke-Quand\" /><ref name=\"LA Times-1993.09.29\" /> in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910\u20132002) and as ''Regulus'' in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. In 2005, the book was also translated into [[Toba Qom language|Toba Qom]], an indigenous language of northern [[Argentina]], as ''So Shiyaxauolec Nta'a''. It was the first book translated into that language since the [[New Testament]]. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, [[Vogherese]].
