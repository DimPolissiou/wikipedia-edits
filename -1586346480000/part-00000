The newspaper was critical of, and sometimes directly opposed to, the actions of the Japanese government during [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese colonial rule]] (1910\u20131945).\n\nOn 27 August 1920, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' was suspended after it published an editorial criticizing what it said was the use of excessive force by the Japanese police against Korean citizens. This was the first in a string of suspensions. On 5 September 1920, three days after the first suspension was lifted, the newspaper published an editorial, \"Did the Japanese central governing body shut down our newspaper?\" Then, ''Chosun Ilbo'' was given an indefinite suspension.\n\nIn 1927, the ''Chosun Ilbo''{{'}}s editor and publisher were arrested. The editor was also the chief staff writer. The alleged offense in this case was an editorial describing the mistreatment of prisoners by the colonial government. In May of the same year, in response to an editorial criticizing the deployment of troops into [[Shandong]], the newspaper was suspended for a fourth time - in this case for 133 days. The publisher and chief staff writer, An Jae-hong, were again imprisoned.\n\nAfter these events, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' remained at the forefront of events, trying to improve general public life and sponsoring collaborative events. This was a turbulent period; within the space of three years, the president was replaced three times. On 21 December 1935, in opposition to compulsory Japanese education and plans to assimilate the Korean people and language, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' published 100,000 Korean-language textbooks nationwide.\n\nOver the years, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' company also published many additional titles, including a monthly current affairs magazine, ''Youth Chosun'', the first of its kind in Korea. Others included its sister publication, ''Jogwang''.\n\nIn the summer of 1940, following issue 6,923, the paper was declared officially discontinued by the Japanese ruling government. In the twenty years since its founding, the paper had been suspended by the Japanese government four times, and its issues confiscated over five hundred times before 1932.\n\nWhen [[Liberation of Korea|Korea gained independence]] in 1945, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' came back into publication after a five-year, three-month hiatus.\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\nBesides the daily newspaper, the company also publishes the weekly ''Jugan Chosun'', the monthly ''Wolgan Chosun'' and other newspapers and magazines.

The newspaper was critical of, and sometimes directly opposed to, the actions of the Japanese government during [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese colonial rule]] (1910\u20131945).\n\nOn 27 August 1920, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' was suspended after it published an editorial criticizing what it said was the use of excessive force by the Japanese police against Korean citizens. This was the first in a string of suspensions. On 5 September 1920, three days after the first suspension was lifted, the newspaper published an editorial, \"Did the Japanese central governing body shut down our newspaper?\" Then, ''Chosun Ilbo'' was given an indefinite suspension.\n\nIn 1927, the ''Chosun Ilbo''{{'}}s editor and publisher were arrested. The editor was also the chief staff writer. The alleged offense in this case was an editorial describing the mistreatment of prisoners by the colonial government. In May of the same year, in response to an editorial criticizing the deployment of troops into [[Shandong]], the newspaper was suspended for a fourth time - in this case for 133 days. The publisher and chief staff writer, An Jae-hong, were again imprisoned.\n\nAfter these events, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' remained at the forefront of events, trying to improve general public life and sponsoring collaborative events. This was a turbulent period; within the space of three years, the president was replaced three times. On 21 December 1935, in opposition to compulsory Japanese education and plans to assimilate the Korean people and language, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' published 100,000 Korean-language textbooks nationwide.\n\nOver the years, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' company also published many additional titles, including a monthly current affairs magazine, ''Youth Chosun'', the first of its kind in Korea. Others included its sister publication, ''Jogwang''.\n\nIn the summer of 1940, following issue 6,923, the paper was declared officially discontinued by the Japanese ruling government. In the twenty years since its founding, the paper had been suspended by the Japanese government four times, and its issues confiscated over five hundred times before 1932.\n\nWhen [[Liberation of Korea|Korea gained independence]] in 1945, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' came back into publication after a five-year, three-month hiatus.\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\nBesides the daily newspaper, the company also publishes the weekly ''Jugan Chosun'', the monthly ''Wolgan Chosun'' and other newspapers and magazines. Subsidiaries include Digital Chosun, Wolgan Chosun, Edu-Chosun, and ChosunBiz.\n\n== Controversy ==\n{{see also|Chojoongdong}}\nOn 31 May 2019, the newspaper reported that, based on \"an unidentified source\", the head diplomat of North Korea's nuclear envoy [[Kim Hyok-chol]], had been executed by a North Korean Government firing squad.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/05/31/north-korea-executes-senior-officials-over-failed-trump-summit-report/1296383001/  ''North Korea executes nuclear envoy to U.S. after failed Trump summit: report.''] Kim Hjelmgaard.

When the Taliban came to power he cut all ties with HiG.\n\nHe said he thought the Taliban would bring unity to Afghanistan, and the tribal and regional wars would disappear, and had gone to enlist with them. However, they threw him in prison, because of his earlier association with HiG.\n\nHe denied that he controlled a weapons cache.  He stated that he was illiterate, and this  would have barred him from such an important task.\n\nHe said he was not arrested in the home of an al-Qaeda financier.  He said he was arrested in a house where he had been told to stay by [[Mullah Izat]], a [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] commander, when he had returned to Afghanistan.  After he escaped from the Taliban he and his family had been staying in Pakistan, as refugees, during the Taliban's time in power.\n\nHe said that he had some responsibilities for a group of fighters - but fifteen years ago, during the Soviet occupation.  Further, he had not been that group's commander, but rather he was the one sent to the market to shop for foodstuff.\n\nHe said that when the Americans evicted the Taliban he wanted to work to help bring former king [[Zahir Shah]] back to power.  He said he made contact with General [[Rahim Wardak]].  He said  [[Afghan Defense Ministry|Defense Minister]] [[Fahim Khan]] and [[Besmil Khan]], the commander of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] sent him a message:\n\n<blockquote>...don't do this; we are [[mujahedin]], and the King is a Western guy, and we don't need him.  This won't be good for your future.</blockquote>\n\nHe had once attended a speech by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], the founder of HiG. However, he had never met him.\n\nWhen told that the Tribunal was going to go into closed session, to consider the classified evidence, he was asked if there was anything he said during any of his interrogations that he wanted to expand on, or correct.  He replied that the allegations about storing weapons and about the leadership meeting were new.  He had never been asked about them during his interrogations.\n\nThe Tribunal officers commented on his willingness to cooperate, and asked why he was wearing an orange uniform.\n\n=== Witness ===\n\nHis witness was [[Nasrat Khan]].  Khan testified that he had known Hamidullah's father in the HiG and that he met Hamidullah when he joined, as a teenager.  He testified that he remembered Hamidullah's desertion.\n\n=== Hamidullah's orange uniform ===\n\nHamidullah's Tribunal officers asked him to explain why he was wearing an orange uniform\u2014the uniform issued to Guantanamo captives regarded as \"[[compliant (JTF-GTMO)|non-compliant]]\".\n\n{|\n| '''Q:''' || I wonder why you're still wearing an orange uniform, and are not wearing a white or tan uniform.\n|-\n| '''A:''' || Yes, I've only been in this [color] two days.\n|-\n| '''Q:''' || What color were you before?\n|-\n| '''A:''' || White.

He had served under a commander named [[Abdul Khadar]].  It was during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and everyone joined one or another of the groups resisting the Soviets.  When the Taliban came to power he cut all ties with HiG.\n\nHe said he thought the Taliban would bring unity to Afghanistan, and the tribal and regional wars would disappear, and had gone to enlist with them. However, they threw him in prison, because of his earlier association with HiG.\n\nHe denied that he controlled a weapons cache.  He stated that he was illiterate, and this  would have barred him from such an important task.\n\nHe said he was not arrested in the home of an al-Qaeda financier.  He said he was arrested in a house where he had been told to stay by [[Mullah Izat]], a [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] commander, when he had returned to Afghanistan.  After he escaped from the Taliban he and his family had been staying in Pakistan, as refugees, during the Taliban's time in power.\n\nHe said that he had some responsibilities for a group of fighters - but fifteen years ago, during the Soviet occupation.  Further, he had not been that group's commander, but rather he was the one sent to the market to shop for foodstuff.\n\nHe said that when the Americans evicted the Taliban he wanted to work to help bring former king [[Zahir Shah]] back to power.  He said he made contact with General [[Rahim Wardak]].  He said  [[Afghan Defense Ministry|Defense Minister]] [[Fahim Khan]] and [[Besmil Khan]], the commander of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] sent him a message:\n\n<blockquote>...don't do this; we are [[mujahedin]], and the King is a Western guy, and we don't need him.  This won't be good for your future.</blockquote>\n\nHe had once attended a speech by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], the founder of HiG. However, he had never met him.\n\nWhen told that the Tribunal was going to go into closed session, to consider the classified evidence, he was asked if there was anything he said during any of his interrogations that he wanted to expand on, or correct.  He replied that the allegations about storing weapons and about the leadership meeting were new.  He had never been asked about them during his interrogations.\n\nThe Tribunal officers commented on his willingness to cooperate, and asked why he was wearing an orange uniform.\n\n=== Witness ===\n\nHis witness was [[Nasrat Khan]].  Khan testified that he had known Hamidullah's father in the HiG and that he met Hamidullah when he joined, as a teenager.  He testified that he remembered Hamidullah's desertion.\n\n=== Hamidullah's orange uniform ===\n\nHamidullah's Tribunal officers asked him to explain why he was wearing an orange uniform\u2014the uniform issued to Guantanamo captives regarded as \"[[compliant (JTF-GTMO)|non-compliant]]\".\n\n{|\n| '''Q:''' || I wonder why you're still wearing an orange uniform, and are not wearing a white or tan uniform.\n|-\n| '''A:''' || Yes, I've only been in this [color] two days.\n|-\n| '''Q:''' || What color were you before?\n|-\n| '''A:''' || White.
