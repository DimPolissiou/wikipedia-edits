This was achieved quite simply, by removing the [[steam generator (railroad)|steam heating boiler]] and fitting a larger 8 cylinder [[Sulzer LDA28 engine#8LDA28|8LDA28]] version of the previous 6 cylinder engine. This was possible because of the traffic requirements of the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]]: locomotive-hauled passenger traffic depended on seasonal tourist traffic and was heavier in the Summer, when carriage heating was not needed. In the Winter, their expected use was to be for freight. They thus became the most powerful BR Bo-Bo diesel locomotive.{{sfnp|Webb|1978|pages=43\u201345}} The perennially unreliable steam heating boiler could also be avoided.\n\nA total of 98 were built by the [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]] (BRCW) and were known as \"Cromptons\" after the [[Crompton Parkinson]] electrical equipment installed in them.<ref>{{cite web | title =Class 33 \u2013 Overview | website=Southern E-Group (SEMG) | url =http://www.semgonline.com/diesel/class33_01.html | accessdate = 16 February 2007 }}</ref>\nLike their lower-powered BRCW sisters, the [[British Rail Class 26|26]] and [[British Rail Class 27|27]] classes, their bodywork and cab ends were of all steel construction. They were very similar in appearance to class 26/27 locos, but carried Southern Region two-digit [[Train reporting number|headcode blinds]] between the cab windows.\n\nThe original (1957) number sequence was D6500\u2013D6597.<ref>{{cite web | title =Class 33 \u2013 Technical Details |website=Southern E-Group (SEMG) | url =http://www.semgonline.com/diesel/class33_dat.html | accessdate = 16 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n=== Electric Train Heating (ETH) ===\nThe electrical heating system worked at a DC voltage of 800 V, with a generator capacity of 235 kW. As this was early days for ETH on BR, standards were not yet clear and there was a possibility in this region of a future need to heat continental stock from [[boat train]]s. Both two pole and single pole systems were supported; two pole becoming the standard on BR but some continental stock using a single pole system with return through the rails.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" />\n\nElectrically, the main traction generator was separate from the heating generator, although both were built mechanically as part of the same machine. A third auxiliary generator of 57 kW was arranged similarly, to provide a supply for the traction motor cooling blowers, pumps, brake exhausters etc. The electrical rating for traction power was the same whether heating was in use or not, but the excess engine power now became available for traction.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" />\n\nAvoiding the weight of the boiler and its water and fuel supplies allowed the diesel fuel capacity to be increased from 500 gallons to 800 gallons, compared to the Type 2s.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" />\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Oxford railway station geograph-2401276-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of 33s -  D6527 and D6505 at [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] with a Bromford Bridge (Birmingham) to Fawley (Southampton) oil train in March 1964.]]\n{| class=wikitable style=\"clear:right;float:right;\"\n|+Distribution of locomotives,<br />March 1974<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railways Locoshed Book 1974 edition |year=1974 |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] |location=Shepperton |isbn=0-7110-0558-3 |pages=24\u201325 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n|-\n|colspan=3 |{{Location map+ |England south|width=220 |caption= |places=\n {{Location map~|England south|lat_deg=50.9591 |lon_deg=-1.3491 |label=EH |link=Eastleigh Train and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot |marksize=16 }}\n {{Location map~|England south|lat_deg=51.45 |lon_deg=0.003 |label=HG |link=Hither Green TMD |marksize=16 }}\n}}\n|-\n!Code ||Name ||Quantity\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |EH ||[[Eastleigh Train and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot|Eastleigh]] ||style=\"text-align:right\" |49\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |HG ||[[Hither Green TMD|Hither Green]] ||style=\"text-align:right\" |47\n|-\n|colspan=2 |Withdrawn (1964\u201368) ||style=\"text-align:right\" |2\n|-\n!colspan=2 scope=row |Total built:\n|style=\"text-align:right\" |98\n|}\nThe locomotives were initially needed, unusually, because of an electrification scheme. The 'Kent Coast scheme' was one of five major electrification schemes put forward by the [[1955 Modernisation Plan]]. This scheme would remove steam from Kent, with it replaced by electrification on the heavily-trafficked lines and diesel-electrics on the remainder.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" /><ref name=\"Kent Coast\" />\n\nThe locomotives began service on the South-Eastern Division of the Southern Region but rapidly spread across the whole Region and many were used much further afield \u2013 an example being the weekly [[Cliffe, Kent|Cliffe (Kent)]] to [[Uddingston]] (South Lanarkshire) cement train which they worked as far as [[York]] (and occasionally throughout) in pairs.\n\nOnly the then new [[Head end power|electric train heating]] was fitted, rather than the ubiquitous [[Steam generator (railroad)|steam heating]] which passenger carriages largely used. Early delivery problems and a shortage of steam locomotives resulted in many [[British Rail Class 24|Class 24]] locomotives being borrowed from the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|Midland Region]] and pairs, of 33 + 24, became common on winter passenger services. This resulted in unpopular, complex run-round manoeuvres at termini as the Class 24 needed to be coupled inside to provide steam heat. Emergency provisioning of through-piping for steam heat on some examples of class 33 alleviated this somewhat. The Southern Region was unaccustomed to the operational overhead and maintenance associated with the use of class 24 and they rapidly became unpopular. With the advent of modern stock and warmer seasons, they were returned to the Midland Region.\n\n==Fleet summary==\nFleet summary 2018\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Owner\n! Number\n! Numbers\n!

Under [[TOPS]] they became class 33/0 and were numbered 33001\u201333065. Two accident-damaged locomotives were withdrawn before TOPS took effect.\n\n===Class 33/1 \u2013 push-pull fitted locomotives===\n[[File:Weymouth station, before electrification - geograph.org.uk - 936749.jpg|thumb|33102 propelling a {{BRC|438}} unit from Weymouth, 1987.]]<!-- Not  a great photograph but illustrates a 33 with an EMU.  Consider replacing if better examples can be found-->\nWhile [[third rail]] electrification was expanding on the Southern region, it was not then considered to be justified to extend beyond [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]] and so, in 1965, D6580 was fitted with experimental [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] apparatus, high-level brake pipes and [[Multiple-unit train control|jumper cables]] to make it compatible with Multiple Unit stock. Commencing 21 July 1965 tests were carried out between Wimbledon Park and Basingstoke, and then from 17 January 1966 on the [[Oxted Line]] using a 6-coach rake of unpowered multiple unit coaches (designated TC, standing for Trailer Control). The use of this equipment removed the necessity for the locomotive to run around to the front of its train at each terminus, as it could be controlled from the driving position of a TC unit and hence could propel its train from the rear.\n\nFollowing successful completion of trials, D6580 and eighteen other members of the class entered [[Eastleigh Works]] to be fitted with a modified version of the [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] apparatus \u2013 fully compatible with [[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] and [[British Rail Class 74|Class 74]] Electro-Diesels and indeed any Electro-Pneumatically controlled (EP) Multiple Unit stock. They emerged painted in the new [[Rail Blue|BR corporate blue]] with full yellow ends. D6521 re-entering service by November 1966 so equipped and by November 1967 the remainder had returned to traffic fitted for push-pull working. <ref>Various Modern Railways magazine of the period {{full|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of TOPS, Class 34 had been reserved for these modified locomotives but it was not used and they were grouped, instead, into class 33/1 being numbered in the range 33101\u201333119.\n\nThey settled into sterling service, proving themselves highly useful and reliable. The prototype locomotive (D6580 later 33119) was the only member of Class 33 to run in green livery with the Multiple Unit control equipment \u2013 not to be confused with preserved members of Class 33/1 that have been repainted into green.\n\n=== Class 33/2 \u2013 narrow-bodied locomotives ===\n[[File:BR 33 208.jpg|thumb|33 208 in BR civil engineers livery at Eastleigh, 1995]]\nThe second batch of 12 locomotives was built with narrow bodies to allow them to work through the narrow tunnels between Tunbridge Wells and Hastings in Kent and East Sussex.

This and other order book issues with the rolling stock business contributed to the bankruptcy of the business.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Push-pull operations==\n[[File:33 118 at Waterloo station London.jpg|thumb|33118 at [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]]]\nThe mainstay of push-pull operations was the operation over the then un-electrified track from Bournemouth to {{stnlnk|Weymouth}} and the service continued like this across three decades. Weymouth trains started at [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] powered by [[third rail|third-rail]] electric traction via [[Winchester railway station|Winchester]] and [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton]] to Bournemouth. The consist was normally twelve cars made up of a powerful {{convert|3200|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail Class 432|4REP]] electric multiple unit on the rear with two leading units of un-powered [[British Rail Class 438|4TCs]]. At Bournemouth the train would be divided with the 4REP remaining at the London end of Bournemouth station and the 4TCs hauled onward to [[Poole railway station|Poole]] and Weymouth by Class 33/1. On the return leg, the locomotive propelled the train back to Bournemouth where it would be attached to a waiting London-bound 4REP and the locomotive detached to await the next Weymouth-bound portion.\n\nThe usual configuration was 4TC+4TC+Loco with the locomotive at the country end. Light traffic would result in 4TC+Loco, and in rare operational circumstances 4TC+Loco+4TC was noted. This combination was not preferred, as it led to operational difficulties and inconvenience to waiting passengers who found themselves confronted with the side of the locomotive when their train has drawn to a halt.\n\nThe Class 33/1 with one or two 4TC sets (normally with the Class 33/1 at the country end of the train) were also the mainstay of the Waterloo \u2013 Salisbury service from their introduction. Platform congestion and the lack of facilities at the very busy Basingstoke station were two of the reasons for class 33/1 operation throughout the route rather than just over the non-electrified section west of Basingstoke.\n\nIn later years Weymouth boat trains, conveying passengers between London and the Channel Islands ferry service out of Weymouth, were handed over to push-pull operation. The section of route from [[Weymouth Harbour Tramway|Weymouth to the ship terminal]] at the [[quay]] is actually [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]], following (and largely in the middle of) the harbour road. The quay spur did not pass through the station, but diverged westwards at the throat thus it was not possible for [[boat train]]s to call at Weymouth station. Boat trains had been made up of conventional coaching stock and the locomotive would [[Run-round loop|run-round]] its train on arrival at the sea-terminal. The move to push-pull sets on boat trains removed two headaches for the SR:\n* The necessity for the run-round at the quay was removed.\n* The locomotive swap at Bournemouth (for both up and down trains) was eliminated and services were greatly improved with the removal of the troublesome [[British Rail Class 74|Class 74]] locomotive from the equation.\n\nAlthough class 73 and 74 electro-diesel locomotives had push-pull capability, they did not have the endurance for longer runs on diesel power \u2013 their 600/650HP was not even [[List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes|Type 1]] \u2013 little more than a high-powered shunter equivalent. The Type 3 power of Class 33/1 with only a 4 or 8 car train was rarely into the recovery margin of a schedule due to load.\n\nClass 33/1 and 4TC combinations were often used to supplement other services and were not just the purview of Bournemouth-Weymouth trains. Services could be rostered for a push-pull set due to stock shortages \u2013 the Reading to Basingstoke service (normally a stronghold of [[Diesel multiple unit#Diesel-electric|DEMU]] sets) could be relied upon to produce a push-pull set on Sundays. Often, electric rosters would be substituted by class 33/1 + 4TC if the line was de-energised during engineering work. Indeed, push-pull sets were a possibility over the entire range of Southern Region services including inter-regional trains; they were not in-frequent visitors to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and have been noted at [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]].\n\nAlthough in private ownership at the time, 33103 and 4TC 417 were spot-hired for use on [[Gospel Oak to Barking line|Barking-Gospel Oak]] services during a stock shortage in 1999 and worked the service for some weeks without issue.\n\nA further member of the class; 33115, was used as a dead-load test before the introduction of [[Eurostar]] trains running on Southern tracks into Waterloo, with running number 83301. Having been fitted with Eurostar bogies (complete with electric 3rd rail collector shoes), it formed part of a test train where its through-wiring for push-pull work was necessary for the completion of tests.\n\n==Tramway safety==\n[[File:33109 Weymouth Harbour Tramway August 1981.jpg|thumb|right|33109 arrives at the ferry terminal having negotiated the [[Weymouth Harbour Tramway]] on its way to [[Weymouth Quay railway station|quay]] in August 1981. Note the bell and beacon warning unit on the cab front and the platform height air brake pipes with two rolled flags wedged behind.]]\nAllocated to work the [[Weymouth Harbour Tramway]], trains operating over public thoroughfare tramway without escort are required to be fitted with warning equipment for the general public. Before its withdrawal, the [[British Rail Class 03|Class 03]] Weymouth pilot would regularly take fuel-oil tank wagons (for the ferries) and occasionally boat-train stock between Weymouth yard and ferry terminal. It had a bell and beacon fitted at both ends above the lower-centre headcode lamp (along with SR style high-level brake pipes) which served to warn thoroughfare users and was controlled from the cab. For main-line stock, two warning units were built and housed in a cabinet at the track side of the quay spur at the throat of the yard. This equipment comprised a yellow control box with amber rotating [[beacon]] and bell which fitted on a bracket just above the rubbing plate on the cab front. Class 33/1 and all TC stock were equipped with this bracket and a socket where units plugged-in to draw power from the train systems. This was a specific complexity with the two types and in order to standardize and remove a maintenance risk, in the early 1980s, three battery-powered units were constructed which mounted on a standard lamp bracket with no need to draw power from the train. This allowed the power and control circuitry for warning units to be removed during (and thus simplifying) overhaul. The old power sockets were gradually removed and plated-over but some remained until withdrawal of the stock. These new units also enabled other types of stock to use the tramway. They were smaller, had an on/off switch on the rear of the unit and no bell \u2013 warnings being given using the train horn.\n\nTrains for the quay would halt at the station throat, and the warning equipment was attached and tested by the [[train guard]]. In addition, trains on the tramway were \"walked\" by railway staff with flags, clearing the route of people and badly parked cars all the way between the points at which the tramway reverted to conventional track at the quay station and road crossing into Weymouth yard. On arrival at the quay terminus the guard would move the warning equipment to the other end of the train in readiness for the return journey. In later years, (e.g. for Railtours) the local Police fulfil the role of traffic control and the process of moving a train along the tramway has become a lot less routine.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n* On 23 March 1960, locomotive D6520 was hauling a freight that was derailed between {{rws|Burghclere}} and {{rws|Highclere}}, [[Hampshire]].<ref name=Bishop>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Bishop |title=Off the Rails |publisher=Kingfisher |location=Southampton |year=1984 |pages=65\u201368, 83\u201387 |isbn=0 946184 06 2}}</ref>\n* On 5 March 1964, locomotive D6502 was hauling a freight train when it [[Signal passed at danger|ran through signals]] at [[Itchingfield|Itchingfield Junction]], [[West Sussex]] and was in a rear-end collision with a freight train.

This was achieved quite simply, by removing the [[steam generator (railroad)|steam heating boiler]] and fitting a larger 8 cylinder [[Sulzer LDA28 engine#8LDA28|8LDA28]] version of the previous 6 cylinder engine. This was possible because of the traffic requirements of the [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]]: locomotive-hauled passenger traffic depended on seasonal tourist traffic and was heavier in the Summer, when carriage heating was not needed. In the Winter, their expected use was to be for freight. They thus became the most powerful BR Bo-Bo diesel locomotive.{{sfnp|Webb|1978|pages=43\u201345}} The perennially unreliable steam heating boiler could also be avoided.\n\nA total of 98 were built by the [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]] (BRCW) and were known as \"Cromptons\" after the [[Crompton Parkinson]] electrical equipment installed in them.<ref>{{cite web | title =Class 33 \u2013 Overview | website=Southern E-Group (SEMG) | url =http://www.semgonline.com/diesel/class33_01.html | accessdate = 16 February 2007 }}</ref>\nLike their lower-powered BRCW sisters, the [[British Rail Class 26|26]] and [[British Rail Class 27|27]] classes, their bodywork and cab ends were of all steel construction. They were very similar in appearance to class 26/27 locos, but carried Southern Region two-digit [[Train reporting number|headcode blinds]] between the cab windows.\n\nThe original (1957) number sequence was D6500\u2013D6597.<ref>{{cite web | title =Class 33 \u2013 Technical Details |website=Southern E-Group (SEMG) | url =http://www.semgonline.com/diesel/class33_dat.html | accessdate = 16 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n=== Electric Train Heating (ETH) ===\nThe electrical heating system worked at a DC voltage of 800 V, with a generator capacity of 235 kW. As this was early days for ETH on BR, standards were not yet clear and there was a possibility in this region of a future need to heat continental stock from [[boat train]]s. Both two pole and single pole systems were supported; two pole becoming the standard on BR but some continental stock using a single pole system with return through the rails.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" />\n\nElectrically, the main traction generator was separate from the heating generator, although both were built mechanically as part of the same machine. A third auxiliary generator of 57 kW was arranged similarly, to provide a supply for the traction motor cooling blowers, pumps, brake exhausters etc. The electrical rating for traction power was the same whether heating was in use or not, but the excess engine power now became available for traction.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" />\n\nAvoiding the weight of the boiler and its water and fuel supplies allowed the diesel fuel capacity to be increased from 500 gallons to 800 gallons, compared to the Type 2s.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" />\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Oxford railway station geograph-2401276-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of 33s -  D6527 and D6505 at [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] with a Bromford Bridge (Birmingham) to Fawley (Southampton) oil train in March 1964.]]\n{| class=wikitable style=\"clear:right;float:right;\"\n|+Distribution of locomotives,<br />March 1974<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railways Locoshed Book 1974 edition |year=1974 |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] |location=Shepperton |isbn=0-7110-0558-3 |pages=24\u201325 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n|-\n|colspan=3 |{{Location map+ |England south|width=220 |caption= |places=\n {{Location map~|England south|lat_deg=50.9591 |lon_deg=-1.3491 |label=EH |link=Eastleigh Train and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot |marksize=16 }}\n {{Location map~|England south|lat_deg=51.45 |lon_deg=0.003 |label=HG |link=Hither Green TMD |marksize=16 }}\n}}\n|-\n!Code ||Name ||Quantity\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |EH ||[[Eastleigh Train and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot|Eastleigh]] ||style=\"text-align:right\" |49\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |HG ||[[Hither Green TMD|Hither Green]] ||style=\"text-align:right\" |47\n|-\n|colspan=2 |Withdrawn (1964\u201368) ||style=\"text-align:right\" |2\n|-\n!colspan=2 scope=row |Total built:\n|style=\"text-align:right\" |98\n|}\nThe locomotives were initially needed, unusually, because of an electrification scheme. The 'Kent Coast scheme' was one of five major electrification schemes put forward by the [[1955 Modernisation Plan]]. This scheme would remove steam from Kent, with it replaced by electrification on the heavily-trafficked lines and diesel-electrics on the remainder.<ref name=\"RM, Type 3\" /><ref name=\"Kent Coast\" />\n\nThe locomotives began service on the South-Eastern Division of the Southern Region but rapidly spread across the whole Region and many were used much further afield \u2013 an example being the weekly [[Cliffe, Kent|Cliffe (Kent)]] to [[Uddingston]] (South Lanarkshire) cement train which they worked as far as [[York]] (and occasionally throughout) in pairs.\n\nOnly the then new [[Head end power|electric train heating]] was fitted, rather than the ubiquitous [[Steam generator (railroad)|steam heating]] which passenger carriages largely used. Early delivery problems and a shortage of steam locomotives resulted in many [[British Rail Class 24|Class 24]] locomotives being borrowed from the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|Midland Region]] and pairs, of 33 + 24, became common on winter passenger services. This resulted in unpopular, complex run-round manoeuvres at termini as the Class 24 needed to be coupled inside to provide steam heat. Emergency provisioning of through-piping for steam heat on some examples of class 33 alleviated this somewhat. The Southern Region was unaccustomed to the operational overhead and maintenance associated with the use of class 24 and they rapidly became unpopular. With the advent of modern stock and warmer seasons, they were returned to the Midland Region.\n\n==Fleet summary==\nFleet summary 2018\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Owner\n! Number\n! Numbers\n!

Under [[TOPS]] they became class 33/0 and were numbered 33001\u201333065. Two accident-damaged locomotives were withdrawn before TOPS took effect.\n\n===Class 33/1 \u2013 push-pull fitted locomotives===\n[[File:Weymouth station, before electrification - geograph.org.uk - 936749.jpg|thumb|33102 propelling a {{BRC|438}} unit from Weymouth, 1987.]]<!-- Not  a great photograph but illustrates a 33 with an EMU.  Consider replacing if better examples can be found-->\nWhile [[third rail]] electrification was expanding on the Southern region, it was not then considered to be justified to extend beyond [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]] and so, in 1965, D6580 was fitted with experimental [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] apparatus, high-level brake pipes and [[Multiple-unit train control|jumper cables]] to make it compatible with Multiple Unit stock. Commencing 21 July 1965 tests were carried out between Wimbledon Park and Basingstoke, and then from 17 January 1966 on the [[Oxted Line]] using a 6-coach rake of unpowered multiple unit coaches (designated TC, standing for Trailer Control). The use of this equipment removed the necessity for the locomotive to run around to the front of its train at each terminus, as it could be controlled from the driving position of a TC unit and hence could propel its train from the rear.\n\nFollowing successful completion of trials, D6580 and eighteen other members of the class entered [[Eastleigh Works]] to be fitted with a modified version of the [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] apparatus \u2013 fully compatible with [[British Rail Class 73|Class 73]] and [[British Rail Class 74|Class 74]] Electro-Diesels and indeed any Electro-Pneumatically controlled (EP) Multiple Unit stock. They emerged painted in the new [[Rail Blue|BR corporate blue]] with full yellow ends. D6521 re-entering service by November 1966 so equipped and by November 1967 the remainder had returned to traffic fitted for push-pull working. <ref>Various Modern Railways magazine of the period {{full|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of TOPS, Class 34 had been reserved for these modified locomotives but it was not used and they were grouped, instead, into class 33/1 being numbered in the range 33101\u201333119.\n\nThey settled into sterling service, proving themselves highly useful and reliable. The prototype locomotive (D6580 later 33119) was the only member of Class 33 to run in green livery with the Multiple Unit control equipment \u2013 not to be confused with preserved members of Class 33/1 that have been repainted into green.\n\n=== Class 33/2 \u2013 narrow-bodied locomotives ===\n[[File:BR 33 208.jpg|thumb|33 208 in BR civil engineers livery at Eastleigh, 1995]]\nThe second batch of 12 locomotives was built with narrow bodies to allow them to work through the narrow tunnels between Tunbridge Wells and Hastings in Kent and East Sussex. The \"[[Hastings Line|Hastings profile]]\",<ref>{{cite magazine |issn=0264-3642 | last = Marsden  | first = Colin J  | title = The Southern Type 3's  | magazine =Modern Railways Pictorial Profile| issue = 11 |pages=4\u20136 |publisher=Ian Allan Ltd | location = Weybridge | date = November 1985 \u2013 January 1986}}</ref> required the bodies to be reduced in width by {{convert|7|in|mm|0}} to avoid clipping tunnel linings on that line, leading to their nickname of 'Slim Jims'.<ref name=\"Ashford\">''Modern Railways Pictorial 1986'', page 115</ref>\n\nThe high cost of re-tooling the jigs and fixtures for construction of these narrow bodies was extensive and based on the very small number of locomotives, was financially painful to BRCW. This and other order book issues with the rolling stock business contributed to the bankruptcy of the business.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Push-pull operations==\n[[File:33 118 at Waterloo station London.jpg|thumb|33118 at [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]]]\nThe mainstay of push-pull operations was the operation over the then un-electrified track from Bournemouth to {{stnlnk|Weymouth}} and the service continued like this across three decades. Weymouth trains started at [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] powered by [[third rail|third-rail]] electric traction via [[Winchester railway station|Winchester]] and [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton]] to Bournemouth. The consist was normally twelve cars made up of a powerful {{convert|3200|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail Class 432|4REP]] electric multiple unit on the rear with two leading units of un-powered [[British Rail Class 438|4TCs]]. At Bournemouth the train would be divided with the 4REP remaining at the London end of Bournemouth station and the 4TCs hauled onward to [[Poole railway station|Poole]] and Weymouth by Class 33/1. On the return leg, the locomotive propelled the train back to Bournemouth where it would be attached to a waiting London-bound 4REP and the locomotive detached to await the next Weymouth-bound portion.\n\nThe usual configuration was 4TC+4TC+Loco with the locomotive at the country end. Light traffic would result in 4TC+Loco, and in rare operational circumstances 4TC+Loco+4TC was noted. This combination was not preferred, as it led to operational difficulties and inconvenience to waiting passengers who found themselves confronted with the side of the locomotive when their train has drawn to a halt.\n\nThe Class 33/1 with one or two 4TC sets (normally with the Class 33/1 at the country end of the train) were also the mainstay of the Waterloo \u2013 Salisbury service from their introduction. Platform congestion and the lack of facilities at the very busy Basingstoke station were two of the reasons for class 33/1 operation throughout the route rather than just over the non-electrified section west of Basingstoke.\n\nIn later years Weymouth boat trains, conveying passengers between London and the Channel Islands ferry service out of Weymouth, were handed over to push-pull operation. The section of route from [[Weymouth Harbour Tramway|Weymouth to the ship terminal]] at the [[quay]] is actually [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]], following (and largely in the middle of) the harbour road. The quay spur did not pass through the station, but diverged westwards at the throat thus it was not possible for [[boat train]]s to call at Weymouth station. Boat trains had been made up of conventional coaching stock and the locomotive would [[Run-round loop|run-round]] its train on arrival at the sea-terminal. The move to push-pull sets on boat trains removed two headaches for the SR:\n* The necessity for the run-round at the quay was removed.\n* The locomotive swap at Bournemouth (for both up and down trains) was eliminated and services were greatly improved with the removal of the troublesome [[British Rail Class 74|Class 74]] locomotive from the equation.\n\nAlthough class 73 and 74 electro-diesel locomotives had push-pull capability, they did not have the endurance for longer runs on diesel power \u2013 their 600/650HP was not even [[List of British Rail modern traction locomotive classes|Type 1]] \u2013 little more than a high-powered shunter equivalent. The Type 3 power of Class 33/1 with only a 4 or 8 car train was rarely into the recovery margin of a schedule due to load.\n\nClass 33/1 and 4TC combinations were often used to supplement other services and were not just the purview of Bournemouth-Weymouth trains. Services could be rostered for a push-pull set due to stock shortages \u2013 the Reading to Basingstoke service (normally a stronghold of [[Diesel multiple unit#Diesel-electric|DEMU]] sets) could be relied upon to produce a push-pull set on Sundays. Often, electric rosters would be substituted by class 33/1 + 4TC if the line was de-energised during engineering work. Indeed, push-pull sets were a possibility over the entire range of Southern Region services including inter-regional trains; they were not in-frequent visitors to [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] and have been noted at [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]].\n\nAlthough in private ownership at the time, 33103 and 4TC 417 were spot-hired for use on [[Gospel Oak to Barking line|Barking-Gospel Oak]] services during a stock shortage in 1999 and worked the service for some weeks without issue.\n\nA further member of the class; 33115, was used as a dead-load test before the introduction of [[Eurostar]] trains running on Southern tracks into Waterloo, with running number 83301. Having been fitted with Eurostar bogies (complete with electric 3rd rail collector shoes), it formed part of a test train where its through-wiring for push-pull work was necessary for the completion of tests.\n\n==Tramway safety==\n[[File:33109 Weymouth Harbour Tramway August 1981.jpg|thumb|right|33109 arrives at the ferry terminal having negotiated the [[Weymouth Harbour Tramway]] on its way to [[Weymouth Quay railway station|quay]] in August 1981. Note the bell and beacon warning unit on the cab front and the platform height air brake pipes with two rolled flags wedged behind.]]\nAllocated to work the [[Weymouth Harbour Tramway]], trains operating over public thoroughfare tramway without escort are required to be fitted with warning equipment for the general public. Before its withdrawal, the [[British Rail Class 03|Class 03]] Weymouth pilot would regularly take fuel-oil tank wagons (for the ferries) and occasionally boat-train stock between Weymouth yard and ferry terminal. It had a bell and beacon fitted at both ends above the lower-centre headcode lamp (along with SR style high-level brake pipes) which served to warn thoroughfare users and was controlled from the cab. For main-line stock, two warning units were built and housed in a cabinet at the track side of the quay spur at the throat of the yard. This equipment comprised a yellow control box with amber rotating [[beacon]] and bell which fitted on a bracket just above the rubbing plate on the cab front. Class 33/1 and all TC stock were equipped with this bracket and a socket where units plugged-in to draw power from the train systems. This was a specific complexity with the two types and in order to standardize and remove a maintenance risk, in the early 1980s, three battery-powered units were constructed which mounted on a standard lamp bracket with no need to draw power from the train. This allowed the power and control circuitry for warning units to be removed during (and thus simplifying) overhaul. The old power sockets were gradually removed and plated-over but some remained until withdrawal of the stock. These new units also enabled other types of stock to use the tramway. They were smaller, had an on/off switch on the rear of the unit and no bell \u2013 warnings being given using the train horn.\n\nTrains for the quay would halt at the station throat, and the warning equipment was attached and tested by the [[train guard]]. In addition, trains on the tramway were \"walked\" by railway staff with flags, clearing the route of people and badly parked cars all the way between the points at which the tramway reverted to conventional track at the quay station and road crossing into Weymouth yard. On arrival at the quay terminus the guard would move the warning equipment to the other end of the train in readiness for the return journey. In later years, (e.g. for Railtours) the local Police fulfil the role of traffic control and the process of moving a train along the tramway has become a lot less routine.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n* On 23 March 1960, locomotive D6520 was hauling a freight that was derailed between {{rws|Burghclere}} and {{rws|Highclere}}, [[Hampshire]].<ref name=Bishop>{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Bishop |title=Off the Rails |publisher=Kingfisher |location=Southampton |year=1984 |pages=65\u201368, 83\u201387 |isbn=0 946184 06 2}}</ref>\n* On 5 March 1964, locomotive D6502 was hauling a freight train when it [[Signal passed at danger|ran through signals]] at [[Itchingfield|Itchingfield Junction]], [[West Sussex]] and was in a rear-end collision with a freight train.

Archaeological investigations in Selby have revealed extensive remains, including waterlogged deposits in the core of the town dating from the Roman period onwards. It is believed that Selby originated as a settlement called Seletun which was referred to in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] of AD 779.\n\nThe place-name 'Selby' is first attested in a Yorkshire charter circa 1030, where it appears as ''Seleby''. It appears as ''Selbi'' circa 1050. The name is thought to be a Scandinavian form of Seletun, meaning '[[Salix caprea|sallow tree]] settlement'.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.411.</ref>\n\nThe town of Selby, a sizeable town on the main route north from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], is the traditional birthplace of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]], in 1068/69;<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.selby.gov.uk/service_main.asp?menuid=&pageid=&id=1474\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614113455/http://www.selby.gov.uk/service_main.asp?menuid=&pageid=&id=1474\n|archivedate=14 June 2011\n|title=Your 'Excellent' Council\n|publisher=Selby District Council\n|accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> the connection is supported by William and his wife [[Matilda of Flanders|Matilda]]'s unique joint charter of [[Selby Abbey]], far to the north of their usual circuit of activities, which was founded for [[Selby Abbey|Benedict of Auxerre]] in 1069<ref>[[C.

King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] is reputed to have been born there in either 1068 or 1069. A notable feature of the abbey is the 14th-century Washington Window, featuring the [[Coat of arms of George Washington|heraldic arms]] of the ancestors of [[George Washington]], the first [[president of the United States]]. The design is often cited as an influence for the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] flag.\n\nIt is said that the abbey was founded when Benedict saw three swans on a lake in Selby, and he saw it as a sign of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and that is why the official crest of Selby Abbey is three swans.<ref> However, a more likely explanation is that the three swans - symbols of purity - represent the triple dedication of the Abbey Church to Our Lord, Our Lady and St Germain.\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.selbyabbey.org.uk/history.htm\n|title=Abbey History - One of England's Best Churches\n|publisher=selbyabbey.org.uk\n|accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> Selby Abbey was closed in 1539 as part of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII]] and the majority of the buildings have since been demolished.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/content/articles/2009/05/13/selby_archaeology_feature.shtml\n|title=North Yorkshire - History - Selby's past revealed\n|publisher=BBC\n|accessdate=22 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> The central nave of the abbey church survived and in 1618 it became the parish church of Selby.\n\nThere was also a very important battle in the [[English Civil War]], named the [[Battle of Selby]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=327\n|title=The 11th of April 1644 AD, Battle of Selby, famous dates in History\n|publisher=information-britain.co.uk\n|accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> There are many other historical sites, like the [[cholera]] [[burial ground]] on the north side of the abbey,<ref name=\"guide\">{{Cite book|last=Selby Civic Society|title=Selby.

New houses and shops are being built on the present town's outskirts with the expansion of the town stretching as far as the bypass, although this has resulted in the loss of some trade from the town centre.

This often required the more unusual technique of launching the vessels side-on into the river due to lack of space for a more conventional stern first or bow first launch.  One famous vessel of the Cochrane and Son's shipyard of the town is the preserved trawler ''[[Ross Tiger]]'' at [[Grimsby]]'s [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]]. Cochrane launched their last vessel into the Ouse in 1998, a historical occasion which people around the area went to see. Once Cochrane had closed, the massive cranes still stood over the skyline of Selby until 2001, when seriously strong winds blew them down. Most of the shipyard buildings are still standing (as of February 2014) and the site along with interviews with former employees and archive film was featured in a 2013 video production 'Cochranes of Selby'. The site of the shipyard is currently home to many small businesses who work in the same buildings that were once used to build the Selby ships.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Selby Town Old Council Offices - geograph.org.uk - 108302.jpg|thumb|right|Former town council offices, Selby]]\n[[File:Selby Town Hall (Taken by Flickr user 31st December 2015).jpg|thumb|right|Selby Town Hall]]\nAt the lowest level of governance is [http://selbytowncouncil.gov.uk/ Selby Town Council].

It is represented by Conservative MP, [[Nigel Adams]].\n\n==Geography==\nSelby lies on the [[tidal]] [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] in a natural area of Yorkshire known as the [[Humberhead Levels]]. The main roads which cross at Selby are the [[A63 road|A63]] from [[Leeds]] to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and the [[A19 road|A19]] from [[Doncaster]] to [[York]], though the A19 and A63 no longer meet in Selby itself since the opening of the Selby [[Bypass (road)|Bypass]] in 2004. The River Ouse is [[navigable]] upstream as far as York so the old toll bridge by which the A63 crossed the river at Selby had to allow for this. For many years the swing bridge in Selby was a notorious local [[traffic bottleneck|bottleneck]] but since the opening of the Selby bypass congestion in the town has been relieved.\n\nThe importance of Selby as a market town has declined in recent decades and its short lived prominence as the centre of the [[Selby Coalfield]] has also waned. Selby is a [[commuter town]] with proximity to both [[York]] and [[Leeds]]. Its popularity as a tourist destination, due to [[Selby Abbey]], has led to a large amount of development and renovation in the town and surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selby.gov.uk/news_detail.asp?id=921&menuid=2 |title=- Renaissance Works On Track for Summer Finish |publisher=Selby District Council |accessdate=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614113708/http://www.selby.gov.uk/news_detail.asp?id=921&menuid=2 |archivedate=14 June 2011 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[residential]] areas of Selby have also been subject to expansion and development. A significant development called Staynor Hall continues to be developed on the South East of the town, with other developments in the Holmes Lane area, and around the villages of Brayton, Barlby and Thorpe Willoughby. More have been built at various points along the riverfront, the result of an ongoing project to improve an area that had been largely derelict since the decline of the shipbuilding industry.\n\n===Floods===\nIn recent years there have been serious flood problems in Selby and the adjoining village of [[Barlby]].

It was the first new mine in the UK for decades and seen as a rejoinder to widespread concern that the British mining industry was effectively shutting down, particularly following the defeat of the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|1984-85 miners' strike]].\n\n[[Wistow, North Yorkshire|Wistow Colliery]], which was part of the [[Selby Coalfield]], holds the UK record for coal mined in one week\u2014200,743 tonnes in 1995. The 110 square mile (285&nbsp;km\u00b2) Selby Complex, employing 3,000 miners plus contractors and ancillary staff, closed on Friday 14 May 2004 despite rising demand for coal in the UK. [[UK Coal]], the pit's owner, said closure was due to rising costs caused by deteriorating geological conditions and the falling price of coal. In its final years, the company listed a \u00a330 million loss on the plant.\n\nAlthough much of the infrastructure of the shipbuilding and coal mining industries remain both in and around Selby, both industries have long since been defunct. Present day, the main income for the area is derived from [[agronomy|arable farming]] and as a commuter area for [[Leeds]], [[Wakefield]] and [[York]].\n[[File:Selby, Market Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1372240.jpg|thumb|left|Market Cross in central Selby]]\nIn recent years, Selby has seen the development of new shopping areas both in the town centre and on the outskirts.

Archaeological investigations in Selby have revealed extensive remains, including waterlogged deposits in the core of the town dating from the Roman period onwards. It is believed that Selby originated as a settlement called Seletun which was referred to in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] of AD 779.\n\nThe place-name 'Selby' is first attested in a Yorkshire charter circa 1030, where it appears as ''Seleby''. It appears as ''Selbi'' circa 1050. The name is thought to be a Scandinavian form of Seletun, meaning '[[Salix caprea|sallow tree]] settlement'.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.411.</ref>\n\nThe town of Selby, a sizeable town on the main route north from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], is the traditional birthplace of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]], in 1068/69;<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.selby.gov.uk/service_main.asp?menuid=&pageid=&id=1474\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614113455/http://www.selby.gov.uk/service_main.asp?menuid=&pageid=&id=1474\n|archivedate=14 June 2011\n|title=Your 'Excellent' Council\n|publisher=Selby District Council\n|accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> the connection is supported by William and his wife [[Matilda of Flanders|Matilda]]'s unique joint charter of [[Selby Abbey]], far to the north of their usual circuit of activities, which was founded for [[Selby Abbey|Benedict of Auxerre]] in 1069<ref>[[C. Warren Hollister]], ''Henry I'' (Yales English Monarchs) 2001:32f.</ref> and subsequently supported by the [[de Lacy]] family. King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] is reputed to have been born there in either 1068 or 1069. A notable feature of the abbey is the 14th-century Washington Window, featuring the [[Coat of arms of George Washington|heraldic arms]] of the ancestors of [[George Washington]], the first [[president of the United States]]. The design is often cited as an influence for the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] flag.\n\nIt is said that the abbey was founded when Benedict saw three swans on a lake in Selby, and he saw it as a sign of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and that is why the official crest of Selby Abbey is three swans.<ref> However, a more likely explanation is that the three swans - symbols of purity - represent the triple dedication of the Abbey Church to Our Lord, Our Lady and St Germain.\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.selbyabbey.org.uk/history.htm\n|title=Abbey History - One of England's Best Churches\n|publisher=selbyabbey.org.uk\n|accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> Selby Abbey was closed in 1539 as part of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII]] and the majority of the buildings have since been demolished.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/content/articles/2009/05/13/selby_archaeology_feature.shtml\n|title=North Yorkshire - History - Selby's past revealed\n|publisher=BBC\n|accessdate=22 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> The central nave of the abbey church survived and in 1618 it became the parish church of Selby.\n\nThere was also a very important battle in the [[English Civil War]], named the [[Battle of Selby]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=327\n|title=The 11th of April 1644 AD, Battle of Selby, famous dates in History\n|publisher=information-britain.co.uk\n|accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}\n</ref> There are many other historical sites, like the [[cholera]] [[burial ground]] on the north side of the abbey,<ref name=\"guide\">{{Cite book|last=Selby Civic Society|title=Selby.

New houses and shops are being built on the present town's outskirts with the expansion of the town stretching as far as the bypass, although this has resulted in the loss of some trade from the town centre.

This often required the more unusual technique of launching the vessels side-on into the river due to lack of space for a more conventional stern first or bow first launch.  One famous vessel of the Cochrane and Son's shipyard of the town is the preserved trawler ''[[Ross Tiger]]'' at [[Grimsby]]'s [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]]. Cochrane launched their last vessel into the Ouse in 1998, a historical occasion which people around the area went to see. Once Cochrane had closed, the massive cranes still stood over the skyline of Selby until 2001, when seriously strong winds blew them down. Most of the shipyard buildings are still standing (as of February 2014) and the site along with interviews with former employees and archive film was featured in a 2013 video production 'Cochranes of Selby'. The site of the shipyard is currently home to many small businesses who work in the same buildings that were once used to build the Selby ships.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Selby Town Old Council Offices - geograph.org.uk - 108302.jpg|thumb|right|Former town council offices, Selby]]\n[[File:Selby Town Hall (Taken by Flickr user 31st December 2015).jpg|thumb|right|Selby Town Hall]]\nAt the lowest level of governance is [http://selbytowncouncil.gov.uk/ Selby Town Council].

It is represented by Conservative MP, [[Nigel Adams]].\n\n==Geography==\nSelby lies on the [[tidal]] [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] in a natural area of Yorkshire known as the [[Humberhead Levels]]. The main roads which cross at Selby are the [[A63 road|A63]] from [[Leeds]] to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and the [[A19 road|A19]] from [[Doncaster]] to [[York]], though the A19 and A63 no longer meet in Selby itself since the opening of the Selby [[Bypass (road)|Bypass]] in 2004. The River Ouse is [[navigable]] upstream as far as York so the old toll bridge by which the A63 crossed the river at Selby had to allow for this. For many years the swing bridge in Selby was a notorious local [[traffic bottleneck|bottleneck]] but since the opening of the Selby bypass congestion in the town has been relieved.\n\nThe importance of Selby as a market town has declined in recent decades and its short lived prominence as the centre of the [[Selby Coalfield]] has also waned. Selby is a [[commuter town]] with proximity to both [[York]] and [[Leeds]]. Its popularity as a tourist destination, due to [[Selby Abbey]], has led to a large amount of development and renovation in the town and surrounding area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selby.gov.uk/news_detail.asp?id=921&menuid=2 |title=- Renaissance Works On Track for Summer Finish |publisher=Selby District Council |accessdate=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614113708/http://www.selby.gov.uk/news_detail.asp?id=921&menuid=2 |archivedate=14 June 2011 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[residential]] areas of Selby have also been subject to expansion and development. A significant development called Staynor Hall continues to be developed on the South East of the town, with other developments in the Holmes Lane area, and around the villages of Brayton, Barlby and Thorpe Willoughby. More have been built at various points along the riverfront, the result of an ongoing project to improve an area that had been largely derelict since the decline of the shipbuilding industry.\n\n===Floods===\nIn recent years there have been serious flood problems in Selby and the adjoining village of [[Barlby]].

It was the first new mine in the UK for decades and seen as a rejoinder to widespread concern that the British mining industry was effectively shutting down, particularly following the defeat of the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|1984-85 miners' strike]].\n\n[[Wistow, North Yorkshire|Wistow Colliery]], which was part of the [[Selby Coalfield]], holds the UK record for coal mined in one week\u2014200,743 tonnes in 1995. The 110 square mile (285&nbsp;km\u00b2) Selby Complex, employing 3,000 miners plus contractors and ancillary staff, closed on Friday 14 May 2004 despite rising demand for coal in the UK. [[UK Coal]], the pit's owner, said closure was due to rising costs caused by deteriorating geological conditions and the falling price of coal. In its final years, the company listed a \u00a330 million loss on the plant.\n\nAlthough much of the infrastructure of the shipbuilding and coal mining industries remain both in and around Selby, both industries have long since been defunct. Present day, the main income for the area is derived from [[agronomy|arable farming]] and as a commuter area for [[Leeds]], [[Wakefield]] and [[York]].\n[[File:Selby, Market Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1372240.jpg|thumb|left|Market Cross in central Selby]]\nIn recent years, Selby has seen the development of new shopping areas both in the town centre and on the outskirts. The Abbey Walk Shopping Centre was developed on recreational land that runs parallel to the town centre. The expansion not only increased the volume of town centre shops but also provided large scale, convenient parking for the town centre. In more recent years, the Three Lakes Retail Park has opened on the outskirts of town and continues to expand with more developments under construction.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.dransfield.co.uk/property.php?id=56&DPLSESS=9b381afe6957120304e017d20c6ae85e\n|title=Three Lakes Retail Park, Selby - Retail developers and leaders in urban regeneration \n|publisher=Dransfield Properties Limited\n|accessdate=22 June 2009\n\n}}\n</ref> Two of the town's supermarkets, [[Tesco]] and [[Morrisons]] are both looking to expand their stores, the latter meaning the re-siting of the Abbey Primary School.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/4331965.stm\n|title=   School could make way for shops\n|accessdate=22 June 2009\n| date=9 March 2005\n| publisher=BBC News}}\n</ref>\n\nOn 14 September 2005, Selby District Council was conditionally granted outline planning permission for a [[state of the art]] science facility to be built on the site of [[Burn, North Yorkshire|Burn]] [[Gliding|Gliding Club]] but these plans did not come to fruition.<ref>\n{{cite news\n |url         = http://www.selbytimes.co.uk/district-news/Hopes-high-for-plan-to.3989704.jp\n |title       = Hopes high for plan to keep gliding club\n |work        = Selby Times\n |accessdate  = 22 June 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130422063505/http://www.selbytimes.co.uk/district-news/Hopes-high-for-plan-to.3989704.jp\n |archivedate = 22 April 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Selby station geograph-3852727-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|[[Selby railway station]]]]\nSelby is the transport hub for the local area and has a bus and railway station running services to many places around the area.

On 28 February 2001, a vehicle crashed off the M62 down an embankment on to a railway track, where it was struck by a passenger train heading to London.
