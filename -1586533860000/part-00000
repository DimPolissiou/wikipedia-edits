It is close to [[Kolkata]] and also a part of the area covered by [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA). It is the headquarters of the [[Barrackpore subdivision]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Barrackpore may have originated from the English word [[barracks]], as it was the site of the first cantonment of the [[British East India Company]]. Alternatively, the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' suggests that the name comes from \"Barbakpur\".{{clarify|date=January 2015}} ''Manasa Vijay'', written by [[Bipradas Pipilai]], refers to Barrackpore as \"Chanak\".\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest references to the Barrackpore region are found in the writings of the Greek navigators, geographers, chronicles and historians of the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD. These authors generally referred to the country of a people variously called the Gangaridae, Gangaridai, Gandaritai etc. By the 15th and 16th centuries, Chanak and the other towns in the region had become populous river towns.<ref>De, Barun. ''W.B. District Gazetteer, 24 Parganas ed.'' 1994.</ref> The Statistical Account of Bengal by [[William Wilson Hunter|W.W.Hunter]] mentions the towns and villages of this subdivision on the banks of the Hooghly river as chief trading and marketing centres: \"On The Hugli- Calcutta, the chief seat of commerce in India. Baranagar, Dakhineswar, Agarpara, Panihati, Sukchar- Khardah, Barrackpur, Nawabganj, Ichapore, Shyam Nagar, Naihati and Halisahar contain large bazaars for sale of miscellaneous goods.\"<ref>Hunter W.W. ''A Statistical Account of Bengal'', London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co.1875-1879</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Mughal Empire]], Bengal was divided into [[Circar]]s, or administrative subunits, each of which was ruled over by a Mahal. The name \"Barbuckpur\", another name for Barrackpore, is associated with a Mahal in the ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]''. From the 17th century, the area was ruled over by a line of [[Zamindars]] based in Nona Chandanpukur, Barrackpore.\n\nThe first [[British Empire|British]] barrack or cantonment in India was built in the town in 1772. After the British crown assumed direct control of India, the sprawling Government House and the Government Estate were built in Barrackpore to provide the [[viceroy]] with a suburban residence {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside of Calcutta.\n\nTwo rebellions against British authority took place in Barrackpore in the 19th century. The first of these was [[Barrackpore Mutiny of 1824]], led by Sepoy Bindee Tiwary.<ref>Jaideep Mazumder, The First Martyr, OUTLOOK, 25 August 2008, P.20</ref> In this rebellion, 47th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] refused to board boats to cross the sea for various reason including social taboo \"[[Kala pani (taboo)]]\" to [[Burma]] in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. Consequently, British-manned artillery fired upon and \"erased\" them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley|title=A New History of India|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-533756-3|edition=8th|authorlink=Stanley Wolpert|page=224}}</ref> In 1857, Barrackpore was the scene of an incident that some credit with starting the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]]: an Indian soldier, [[Mangal Pandey]], attacked his British commander, and was subsequently [[court-martial]]ed. His regiment was disbanded, an action which offended a number of [[sepoy]]s and is considered to have contributed to the anger that fueled the rebellion. In order to commemorate his sacrifice, a park named 'Sahid Mangal Pandey Udyan' was opened in the serenity of river Hoogly. The Army cantonment of Barrackpore also houses another significant historical [[landscape]] called the RCTC area, now populated by the defence quarters.<ref>http://www.rctconline.com/booktext/book7.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705083411/http://www.rctconline.com/booktext/book7.html |date=5 July 2008

It is close to [[Kolkata]] and also a part of the area covered by [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA). It is the headquarters of the [[Barrackpore subdivision]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Barrackpore may have originated from the English word [[barracks]], as it was the site of the first cantonment of the [[British East India Company]]. Alternatively, the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' suggests that the name comes from \"Barbakpur\".{{clarify|date=January 2015}} ''Manasa Vijay'', written by [[Bipradas Pipilai]], refers to Barrackpore as \"Chanak\".\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest references to the Barrackpore region are found in the writings of the Greek navigators, geographers, chronicles and historians of the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD. These authors generally referred to the country of a people variously called the Gangaridae, Gangaridai, Gandaritai etc. By the 15th and 16th centuries, Chanak and the other towns in the region had become populous river towns.<ref>De, Barun. ''W.B. District Gazetteer, 24 Parganas ed.'' 1994.</ref> The Statistical Account of Bengal by [[William Wilson Hunter|W.W.Hunter]] mentions the towns and villages of this subdivision on the banks of the Hooghly river as chief trading and marketing centres: \"On The Hugli- Calcutta, the chief seat of commerce in India. Baranagar, Dakhineswar, Agarpara, Panihati, Sukchar- Khardah, Barrackpur, Nawabganj, Ichapore, Shyam Nagar, Naihati and Halisahar contain large bazaars for sale of miscellaneous goods.\"<ref>Hunter W.W. ''A Statistical Account of Bengal'', London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co.1875-1879</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Mughal Empire]], Bengal was divided into [[Circar]]s, or administrative subunits, each of which was ruled over by a Mahal. The name \"Barbuckpur\", another name for Barrackpore, is associated with a Mahal in the ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]''. From the 17th century, the area was ruled over by a line of [[Zamindars]] based in Nona Chandanpukur, Barrackpore.\n\nThe first [[British Empire|British]] barrack or cantonment in India was built in the town in 1772. After the British crown assumed direct control of India, the sprawling Government House and the Government Estate were built in Barrackpore to provide the [[viceroy]] with a suburban residence {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside of Calcutta.\n\nTwo rebellions against British authority took place in Barrackpore in the 19th century. The first of these was [[Barrackpore Mutiny of 1824]], led by Sepoy Bindee Tiwary.<ref>Jaideep Mazumder, The First Martyr, OUTLOOK, 25 August 2008, P.20</ref> In this rebellion, 47th [[Bengal Native Infantry]] refused to board boats to cross the sea for various reason including social taboo \"[[Kala pani (taboo)]]\" to [[Burma]] in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. Consequently, British-manned artillery fired upon and \"erased\" them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley|title=A New History of India|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-533756-3|edition=8th|authorlink=Stanley Wolpert|page=224}}</ref> In 1857, Barrackpore was the scene of an incident that some credit with starting the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]]: an Indian soldier, [[Mangal Pandey]], attacked his British commander, and was subsequently [[court-martial]]ed. His regiment was disbanded, an action which offended a number of [[sepoy]]s and is considered to have contributed to the anger that fueled the rebellion. In order to commemorate his sacrifice, a park named 'Sahid Mangal Pandey Udyan' was opened in the serenity of river Hoogly. The Army cantonment of Barrackpore also houses another significant historical [[landscape]] called the RCTC area, now populated by the defence quarters.<ref>http://www.rctconline.com/booktext/book7.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705083411/http://www.rctconline.com/booktext/book7.html |date=5 July 2008

A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.\n\nModern handball is played on a court of {{convert|40|by|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a {{Convert|6|meter|adj=on}} zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while \"diving\" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of [[field handball]], [[Czech handball]] (which were more common in the past) and [[beach handball]]. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Some players may score [[hat tricks]]. Body contact is permitted: the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handbal.nl/userfiles/Scheidsrechters/170801_Clarifications_equipment_IHF.pdf |title=IHF Rules of the Game: Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories |publisher=Nederlands Handbal Verbond |access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark.

Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.<ref>Gardiner, E.

The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the Danish gym teacher, [[lieutenant]] and Olympic medalist [[Holger Nielsen]] from [[Ordrup]] grammar school, north of [[Copenhagen]]. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 by Max Heiser, [[Karl Schelenz]], and Erich Konigh from [[Berlin]], Germany. 29 October 1917 is therefore seen as the \"date of birth\" of the sport.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The first ever official handball match was played on 2 December 1917 in Berlin.<ref name=\":2\" /> After 1919 the rules were improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between [[Germany national handball team|Germany]] and [[Belgium national handball team|Belgium]] by men in 1925 and between [[Germany women's national handball team|Germany]] and [[Austria women's national handball team|Austria]] by women in 1930.\n\nIn 1926, the Congress of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The [[International Amateur Handball Federation]] was formed in 1928 and later the [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946.\n\nMen's field handball was played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. During the next several decades, indoor handball flourished and evolved in the Scandinavian countries. The sport re-emerged onto the world stage as team handball for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. Due to its popularity in the region, the Eastern European countries that refined the event became the dominant force in the sport when it was reintroduced.\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member federations - approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.\n\n==Rules==\nThe rules are laid out in the IHF's set of rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_9A_GB.pdf |title=The official Handball rules (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\nTwo teams of seven players (six field players plus one goalkeeper) take the field and attempt to score points by putting the game ball into the opposing team's goal. In handling the ball, players are subject to the following restrictions:\n\n* After receiving the ball, players can pass, keep possession, or shoot the ball. \n* If possessing the ball, players must dribble (similar to a [[Dribbling#Basketball|basketball dribble]]), or can take up to three steps for up to three seconds at a time without dribbling.\n* No attacking or defending players other than the defending goalkeeper are allowed to touch the floor of the goal area (within six metres of the goal). A shot or pass in the goal area is valid if completed ''before touching the floor''. Goalkeepers are allowed outside the goal area, but are not allowed to cross the goal area boundary with the ball in their hands.\n* The ball may not be passed back to the goalkeeper when they are positioned in the goal area.\n\nNotable scoring opportunities can occur when attacking players jump into the goal area. For example, an attacking player may catch a pass while launching inside the goal area, and then shoot or pass before touching the floor. ''Doubling'' occurs when a diving attacking player passes to another diving teammate.\n\nAlso have fun\n\n===Playing court===\n[[File:Handball field en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a handball playing field]]\n[[File:Rukometno igrali\u0161te kod Macanovog doma, \u010cakovec.2.jpg|thumb|An outdoor handball playing field]]\nHandball is played on a court {{convert|40|x|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the centre of each end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular area, called the zone or the crease, defined by a line six meters from the goal. A dashed near-semicircular line nine metres from the goal marks the free-throw line. Each line on the court is part of the area it encompasses. This implies that the middle line belongs to both halves at the same time.\n\n====Goals====\nThe goals are two meters high and three meters wide. They must be securely bolted either to the floor or the wall behind.\n\nThe goal posts and the crossbar must be made out of the same material (e.g., [[wood]] or [[aluminium]]) and feature a quadratic cross section with sides of {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The three sides of the beams visible from the playing field must be painted alternatingly in two contrasting colors which both have to contrast against the background. The colors on both goals must be the same.\n\nEach goal must feature a net. This must be fastened in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal does not leave or pass the goal under normal circumstances. If necessary, a second net may be clasped to the back of the net on the inside.\n\n====D-Zone====\nThe goals are surrounded by the crease. This area is delineated by two quarter circles with a radius of six metres around the far corners of each goal post and a connecting line parallel to the goal line. Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed inside this zone. However, the court players may catch and touch the ball in the air within it as long as the player starts his jump outside the zone and releases the ball before he lands (landing inside the perimeter is allowed in this case as long as the ball has been released).\n\nIf a player without the ball contacts the ground inside the goal perimeter, or the line surrounding the perimeter, he must take the most direct path out of it. However, should a player cross the zone in an attempt to gain an advantage (e.g., better position) their team cedes the ball. Similarly, violation of the zone by a defending player is penalized only if they do so in order to gain an advantage in defending.\n\n====Substitution area====\nOutside of one long edge of the court to both sides of the middle line are the substitution areas for each team. Team officials, substitutes, and suspended players must wait within this area. A team's area is the same side as the goal the team is defending; during halftime, substitution areas are swapped. Any player entering or leaving the play must cross the substitution line which is part of the side line and extends {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} from the middle line to the team's side.\n\n===Duration===\n[[File: Team Time Out Handball.jpg|thumb|Team timeout]] A standard match has two 30-minute halves with a 10- or 15-minute (major Championships/Olympics) halftime intermission. At half-time, teams switch sides of the court as well as benches. For youths, the length of the halves is reduced\u201425 minutes at ages 12 to 15, and 20 minutes at ages 8 to 11; though national federations of some countries may differ in their implementation from the official guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf|title=Rules of the Game}}</ref>\n\nIf a decision must be reached in a particular match (e.g., in a tournament) and it ends in a draw after regular time, there are at maximum two overtimes, each consisting of two straight 5-minute periods with a one-minute break in between. Should these not decide the game either, the winning team is determined in a penalty shootout (best-of-five rounds; if still tied, extra rounds are added until one team wins).\n\nThe referees may call ''[[Time-out (sport)|timeout]]'' according to their sole discretion; typical reasons are injuries, suspensions, or court cleaning. Penalty throws should trigger a timeout only for lengthy delays, such as a change of the goalkeeper.\n\nSince 2012, teams can call 3 ''team timeouts'' per game (up to two per half), which last one minute each. This right may only be invoked by the team in possession of the ball. Team representatives must show a green card marked with a black ''T'' on the timekeeper's desk. The timekeeper then immediately interrupts the game by sounding an acoustic signal to stop the clock. Before 2012,  teams were allowed only one timeout per half. For the purpose of calling timeouts, overtime and shootouts are extensions of the second half.\n\n===Referees===\nA handball match is adjudicated by two equal referees. Some national bodies allow games with only a single referee in special cases like illness on short notice. Should the referees disagree on any occasion, a decision is made on mutual agreement during a short timeout; or, in case of punishments, the more severe of the two comes into effect. The referees are obliged to make their decisions \"on the basis of their observations of facts\".<ref>Official rules, rule 17:11</ref> Their judgements are final and can be appealed against only if not in compliance with the rules.\n\n[[File:Kronau-Oestringen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The referees (blue shirts) keep both teams between them.]]\n\nThe referees position themselves in such a way that the team players are confined between them. They stand diagonally aligned so that each can observe one side line. Depending on their positions, one is called ''field referee'' and the other ''goal referee''. These positions automatically switch on ball turnover. They physically exchange their positions approximately every 10 minutes (long exchange), and change sides every five minutes (short exchange).\n\nThe IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning is accompanied by a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]].<ref>Official rules, hand signal 16:2</ref> A disqualification for the game is indicated by a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]],<ref>Official rules 16:7</ref> followed by a [[Penalty card#Blue card|blue card]] if the disqualification will be accompanied by a report.<ref>Official rules 16:8</ref> The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.\n\nThe referees are supported by a ''scorekeeper'' and a ''timekeeper'' who attend to formal things such as keeping track of goals and suspensions, or starting and stopping the clock, respectively. They also keep an eye on the benches and notify the referees on substitution errors. Their desk is located between the two substitution areas.\n\n===Team players, substitutes, and officials===\nEach team consists of seven players on court and seven substitute players on the bench. One player on the court must be the designated goalkeeper, differing in his clothing from the rest of the field players. Substitution of players can be done in any number and at any time during game play. An exchange takes place over the substitution line. A prior notification of the referees is not necessary.\n\nSome national bodies, such as the Deutsche Handball Bund (DHB, \"German Handball Federation\"), allow substitution in junior teams only when in ball possession or during timeouts. This restriction is intended to prevent early specialization of players to offence or defence.\n\n====Field players====\nField players are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their bodies above and including the knee. As in several other team sports, a distinction is made between catching and [[dribbling]]. A player who is in possession of the ball may stand stationary for only three seconds, and may take only three steps. They must then either shoot, pass, or dribble the ball. Taking more than three steps at any time is considered travelling, and results in a turnover. A player may dribble as many times as they want (though, since passing is faster, it is the preferred method of attack), as long as during each dribble the hand contacts only the top of the ball. Therefore, [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying]] is completely prohibited, and results in a turnover. After the dribble is picked up, the player has the right to another three seconds or three steps. The ball must then be passed or shot, as further holding or dribbling will result in a ''double dribble'' turnover and a free throw for the other team. Other offensive infractions that result in a turnover include charging and setting an illegal screen. Carrying the ball into the six-meter zone results either in ball possession by the goalkeeper (by attacker) or turnover (by defender).\n\n====Goalkeeper====\nOnly the [[Handball goalkeeper|goalkeepers]] are allowed to move freely within the goal perimeter, although they may not cross the goal perimeter line while carrying or dribbling the ball. Within the zone, they are allowed to touch the ball with all parts of their bodies, including their feet, with a defensive aim (for other actions, they are subject to the same restrictions as the field players). The goalkeepers may participate in the normal play of their teammates. They may be substituted by a regular field player if their team elects to use this scheme in order to outnumber the defending players. Earlier, this field player become the designated goalkeeper on the court; and had to wear some vest or bib to be identified as such. That shirt had to be equal in colour and form to the goalkeeper's shirt, to avoid confusion. A rule change meant to make the game more offensive now allows any player to substitute with the goalkeeper. The new rule resembles the one used in ice hockey. This rule was first used in the women's world championship in December 2015 and has since been used by the men's European championship in January 2016 and by both genders in the Olympic tournament in Rio in 2016.\n\nIf either goalkeeper deflects the ball over the outer goal line, their team stays in possession of the ball, in contrast to other sports like [[Association football|football]]. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from within the zone (\"goalkeeper throw\"). Passing to one's own goalkeeper results in a turnover. In a penalty shot, throwing the ball against the head of a goalkeeper who is not moving risks a direct disqualification (\"red card\").\n\nOutside of own D-zone, the goalkeeper is treated as a current field player, and has to follow field players' rules; holding or tackling an opponent player outside the area risks a direct disqualification.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The goalkeeper may not return to the area with the ball.\n\n====Team officials====\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of four team officials seated on the benches. An official is anybody who is neither player nor substitute. One official must be the designated representative who is usually the [[Coach (sport)|team manager]]. Since 2012, representatives can call up to 3 team timeouts (up to twice per half), and may address the scorekeeper, timekeeper, and referees (before that, it was once per half); overtime and shootouts are considered extensions of the second half. Other officials typically include [[physician]]s or managers. Neither official is allowed to enter the playing court without the permission of the referees.\n\n===Ball===\n[[File:Handball the ball.jpg|thumb|A size III handball]] The ball is spherical and must be made either of leather or a synthetic material. It is not allowed to have a shiny or slippery surface. As the ball is intended to be operated by a single hand, its official sizes vary depending on age and gender of the participating teams.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"column\"| Size\n!scope=\"column\"| Class\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (cm)\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (in)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (g)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (oz)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n| Male over-16s\n|{{convert|58|\u2013|60|cm|in|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|425|\u2013|475|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n| Women, male over-12s, and female over-14s\n| {{convert|54|\u2013|56|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|325|\u2013|375|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n| Over-8s\n| {{convert|50|\u2013|52|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|290|\u2013|330|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Awarded throws===\nThe referees may award a special throw to a team. This usually happens after certain events such as scored goals, off-court balls, turnovers and timeouts. All of these special throws require the thrower to obtain a certain position, and pose restrictions on the positions of all other players. Sometimes the execution must wait for a whistle blow by the referee.\n\n;Throw-off: A throw-off takes place from the center of the court. The thrower must touch the middle line with one foot, and all the other offensive players must stay in their half until the referee restarts the game. The defending players must keep a distance of at least three meters from the thrower until the ball leaves his hand. A throw-off occurs at the beginning of each period and after the opposing team scores a goal. It must be cleared by the referees.\n\n:Modern handball introduced the \"fast throw-off\" concept; i.e., the play will be immediately restarted by the referees as soon as the executing team fulfills its requirements. Many teams leverage this rule to score easy goals before the opposition has time to form a stable defense line.\n\n;Throw-in: The team which did not touch the ball last is awarded a throw-in when the ball fully crosses the side line or touches the ceiling. If the ball crosses the outer goal line, a throw-in is awarded only if the defending field players touched the ball last. Execution requires the thrower to place one foot on the nearest outer line to the cause. All defending players must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}. However, they are allowed to stand immediately outside their own goal area even when the distance is less than three meters.\n\n;Goalkeeper-throw: If the ball crosses the outer goal line without interference from the defending team or when deflected by the defending team's goalkeeper, or when the attacking team violates the D-zone as described above, a goalkeeper-throw is awarded to the defending team. This is the most common turnover. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from anywhere within the goal area.\n\n;Free-throw: A free-throw restarts the play after an interruption by the referees. It takes places from the spot where the interruption was caused, as long as this spot is outside of the free-throw line of the opposing team. In the latter case, the throw is deferred to the nearest spot on the free-throw line. Free-throws are the equivalent to [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]] in association football; however, conceding them is typically not seen as poor sportsmanship for the defending side, and in itself, they carry no major disadvantages. (In particular, being awarded a free throw while being on warning for passive play will not reset the warning, whereas a shot on goal will.)  The thrower may take a direct attempt for a goal which, however, is rarely feasible if the defending team has organised a defense. However, if a free throw is awarded and the half or game ends, a direct throw at the goal is typically attempted, which occasionally goes in.\n\n[[File:Kr-Oe-Siebenmeter.jpg|thumb|A seven-metre throw]]\n;Seven-meter throw: A seven-meter throw is awarded when a clear chance of scoring is illegally prevented anywhere on the court by an opposing team player, official, or spectator. It is awarded also when the referees have interrupted a legitimate scoring chance for any reason. The thrower steps with one foot behind the {{Convert|7|m|adj=on|spell=in}} line with only the defending goalkeeper between him and the goal. The goalkeeper must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}, which is marked by a short tick on the floor. All other players must remain behind the free-throw line until execution and the defending field players must keep a distance of three meters. The thrower must await the whistle blow of the referee. A seven-meter throw is the equivalent to a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in association football; however, it is far more common and typically occurs several times in a single game.\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Yellow card handball.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow card shown in a handball match]]\nPenalties are given to players, in progressive format, for fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. Actions directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, tripping, and jumping into opponent) as well as contact from the side, from behind a player or impeding the opponent's counterattack are all considered illegal and are subject to penalty. Any infraction that prevents a clear scoring opportunity will result in a seven-meter penalty shot.\n\nTypically the referee will give a warning yellow card for an illegal action; but, if the contact was particularly dangerous, like striking the opponent in the head, neck or throat, the referee can forego the warning for an immediate two-minute suspension. Players are warned once before given a yellow card; they risk being red-carded if they draw three yellows.\n\nA red card results in an ejection from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during a fast break is now being treated with a red card; as does any deliberate intent to injure opponents. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes; however, the player is not the one punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with one fewer player than the opposing team.\n\nAfter referees award the ball to the opponents for whatever reason, the player currently in possession of the ball has to lay it down quickly, or risk a two-minute suspension. Also, gesticulating or verbally questioning the referee's order, as well as arguing with the officials' decisions, will normally risk a yellow card. If the suspended player protests further, does not walk straight off the field to the bench, or if the referee deems the tempo deliberately slow, that player risks a double yellow card. Illegal substitution (outside of the dedicated area, or if the replacement player enters too early) is prohibited; if they do, they risk a yellow card.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Formations===\n[[File:5-1-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 5-1 defense formation]]\n[[File:6-0-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 6-0 defense formation]]\nPlayers are typically referred to by the positions they are playing. The positions are always denoted from the view of the respective goalkeeper, so that a defender on the right opposes an attacker on the left. However, not all of the following positions may be occupied depending on the formation or potential suspensions.\n\n====Offense====\n* Left and right wingman.These typically are fast players who excel at ball control and wide jumps from the outside of the goal perimeter in order to get into a better shooting angle at the goal. Teams usually try to occupy the left position with a right-handed player and vice versa.\n* Left and right backcourt. Goal attempts by these players are typically made by jumping high and shooting over the defenders. Thus, it is usually advantageous to have tall players with a powerful shot for these positions.\n* Centre backcourt. A player with experience is preferred on this position who acts as playmaker and the handball equivalent of a basketball [[point guard]].\n* Pivot (left and right, if applicable). This player tends to intermingle with the defence, setting picks and attempting to disrupt the defence's formation. This position requires the least jumping skills; but ball control and physical strength are an advantage.\n\nSometimes, the offense uses formations with two pivot players.\n\n====Defense====\nThere are many variations in defensive formations. Usually, they are described as ''n:m'' formations, where ''n'' is the number of players defending at the goal line and ''m'' the number of players defending more offensive. Exceptions are the 3:2:1 defense and n+m formation (e.g. 5+1), where m players defend some offensive player in man coverage (instead of the usual zone coverage).\n* Far left and far right. The opponents of the wingmen.\n* Half left and half right. The opponents of the left and right backcourts.\n* Back center (left and right). Opponent of the pivot.\n* Front center. Opponent of the center backcourt, may also be set against another specific backcourt player.\n\n===Offensive play===\nAttacks are played with all field players on the side of the defenders. Depending on the speed of the attack, one distinguishes between three attack ''waves'' with a decreasing chance of success:\n\n[[File:Mara Friton Handball.jpg|thumb|Women's handball - a jump shot completes a fast-break]]\n[[File:Kiril Lazarov 09.jpg|thumb|Men's handball - a jump shot ([[Kiril Lazarov]], world record-holder for the number of goals scored in one world championship) ]]\n;First wave: ''First wave'' attacks are characterised by the absence of defending players around their goal perimeter. The chance of success is very high, as the throwing player is unhindered in his scoring attempt. Such attacks typically occur after an intercepted pass or a steal, and if the defending team can switch fast to offence. The far left or far right will usually try to run the attack, as they are not as tightly bound in the defence. On a turnover, they immediately sprint forward and receive the ball halfway to the other goal. Thus, these positions are commonly held by quick players.\n;Second wave: If the first wave is not successful and some defending players have gained their positions around the zone, the second wave comes into play: the remaining players advance with quick passes to locally outnumber the retreating defenders. If one player manages to step up to the perimeter or catches the ball at this spot, he becomes unstoppable by legal defensive means. From this position, the chance of success is naturally very high. Second wave attacks became much more important with the \"fast throw-off\" rule.\n\n;Third wave: The time during which the second wave may be successful is very short, as then the defenders closed the gaps around the zone. In the ''third wave'', the attackers use standardised attack patterns usually involving crossing and passing between the back court players who either try to pass the ball through a gap to their pivot, take a jumping shot from the backcourt at the goal, or lure the defence away from a wingman.\n\nThe third wave evolves into the normal offensive play when all defenders not only reach the zone, but gain their accustomed positions. Some teams then substitute specialised offence players. However, this implies that these players must play in the defence should the opposing team be able to switch quickly to offence. The latter is another benefit for fast playing teams.\n\nIf the attacking team does not make sufficient progress (eventually releasing a shot on goal), the referees can call '''passive play''' (since about 1995, the referee gives a passive warning some time before the actual call by holding one hand up in the air, signalling that the attacking team should release a shot soon), turning control over to the other team. A shot on goal or an infringement leading to a yellow card or two-minute penalty will mark the start of a new attack, causing the hand to be taken down; but a shot blocked by the defense or a normal free throw will not. If it were not for this rule, it would be easy for an attacking team to stall the game indefinitely, as it is difficult to intercept a pass without at the same time conceding dangerous openings towards the goal.\n\n===Defensive play===\nThe usual formations of the defense are 6\u20130, when all the defense players line up between the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} and {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} lines to form a wall; the 5\u20131, when one of the players cruises outside the {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards while the other 5 line up on the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} line; and the less common 4\u20132 when there are two such defenders out front. Very fast teams will also try a 3\u20133 formation which is close to a switching man-to-man style. The formations vary greatly from country to country, and reflect each country's style of play. 6\u20130 is sometimes known as \"flat defense\", and all other formations are usually called \"offensive defense\".\n\n==Organization==\nHandball teams are usually organised as [[sports club|clubs]]. On a national level, the clubs are associated in federations which organize matches in leagues and tournaments.\n\n===International body===\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for international handball.

A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.\n\nModern handball is played on a court of {{convert|40|by|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a {{Convert|6|meter|adj=on}} zone where only the defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by throwing the ball from outside the zone or while \"diving\" into it. The sport is usually played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of [[field handball]], [[Czech handball]] (which were more common in the past) and [[beach handball]]. The game is fast and high-scoring: professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores were not uncommon until a few decades ago. Some players may score [[hat tricks]]. Body contact is permitted: the defenders trying to stop the attackers from approaching the goal. No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and mouth guards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handbal.nl/userfiles/Scheidsrechters/170801_Clarifications_equipment_IHF.pdf |title=IHF Rules of the Game: Regulations on Protective Equipment and Accessories |publisher=Nederlands Handbal Verbond |access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark.

Men's handball was first played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin as outdoors, and the next time at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]] as indoors, and has been an Olympic sport since. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946 and, {{as of|2016|lc=1}}, has 197 member federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/TheIHF/MemberFederations/tabid/161/Default.aspx |title=Member Federations |publisher=International Handball Federation}}</ref> The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all medals but one in the [[IHF World Men's Handball Championship|men's world championships]] since 1938. In the [[IHF World Women's Handball Championship|women's world championships]], only two non-European countries have won the title: South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in [[East Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[South America]].\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Origins and development ==\n[[File:Handball pick-a-back Ancient Greece.jpg|thumb|A picture copied from an amphora shows youths play a version of handball, circa 500 B.C.]]\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1972, MiNr 1757.jpg|thumb|A postage stamp from East Germany depicting handball at the 1972 Olympics]]\nGames similar to handball were played in [[Ancient Greece]] and are represented on amphoras and stone carvings. Although detailed textual reference is rare, there are numerous descriptions of ball games being played where players throw the ball to one another; sometimes this is done in order to avoid interception by a player on the opposing team. Such games were played widely and served as both a form of exercise and a social event.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Ball play' in ''Athletics of the Ancient World'', Oxford: OUP, 1967, pp.230-238</ref>\n\nThere is evidence of ancient Roman women playing a version of handball called ''expulsim ludere''.<ref>John Anthony Cuddon, ''The Macmillan Dictionary of Sports and Games'', p.393, Macmillan, 1980, {{ISBN|0-333-19163-3}}</ref> There are records of handball-like games in medieval [[France]], and among the [[Inuit]] in [[Greenland]], in the [[Middle Ages]]. By the 19th century, there existed similar games of ''h\u00e5ndbold'' from [[Denmark]], ''[[Czech handball|h\u00e1zen\u00e1]]'' in the [[Czech Republic]], ''handbol'' in [[Ukraine]], and ''[[torball]]'' in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Serinex.NET|first1=SegaAlex in|title=Handball History : HAND-BALL.ORG|url=http://www.hand-ball.org/historia/|website=www.hand-ball.org|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe team handball game of today was codified at the end of the 19th century in northern [[Europe]]: primarily in [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. The first written set of team handball rules was published in 1906 by the Danish gym teacher, [[lieutenant]] and Olympic medalist [[Holger Nielsen]] from [[Ordrup]] grammar school, north of [[Copenhagen]]. The modern set of rules was published on 29 October 1917 by Max Heiser, [[Karl Schelenz]], and Erich Konigh from [[Berlin]], Germany. 29 October 1917 is therefore seen as the \"date of birth\" of the sport.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The first ever official handball match was played on 2 December 1917 in Berlin.<ref name=\":2\" /> After 1919 the rules were improved by Karl Schelenz. The first international games were played under these rules, between [[Germany national handball team|Germany]] and [[Belgium national handball team|Belgium]] by men in 1925 and between [[Germany women's national handball team|Germany]] and [[Austria women's national handball team|Austria]] by women in 1930.\n\nIn 1926, the Congress of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] nominated a committee to draw up international rules for field handball. The [[International Amateur Handball Federation]] was formed in 1928 and later the [[International Handball Federation]] was formed in 1946.\n\nMen's field handball was played at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. During the next several decades, indoor handball flourished and evolved in the Scandinavian countries. The sport re-emerged onto the world stage as team handball for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. Women's team handball was added at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. Due to its popularity in the region, the Eastern European countries that refined the event became the dominant force in the sport when it was reintroduced.\n\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] organised the men's world championship in 1938 and every four (sometimes three) years from World War II to 1995. Since the 1995 world championship in Iceland, the competition has been held every two years. The women's world championship has been held since 1957. The IHF also organizes women's and men's junior world championships. By July 2009, the IHF listed 166 member federations - approximately 795,000 teams and 19 million players.\n\n==Rules==\nThe rules are laid out in the IHF's set of rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/upload/Manual/IHF_STATUTS_CHAP_9A_GB.pdf |title=The official Handball rules (PDF) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Summary===\n\nTwo teams of seven players (six field players plus one goalkeeper) take the field and attempt to score points by putting the game ball into the opposing team's goal. In handling the ball, players are subject to the following restrictions:\n\n* After receiving the ball, players can pass, keep possession, or shoot the ball.\n* If possessing the ball, players must dribble (similar to a [[Dribbling#Basketball|basketball dribble]]), or can take up to three steps for up to three seconds at a time without dribbling.\n* No attacking or defending players other than the defending goalkeeper are allowed to touch the floor of the goal area (within six metres of the goal). A shot or pass in the goal area is valid if completed ''before touching the floor''. Goalkeepers are allowed outside the goal area, but are not allowed to cross the goal area boundary with the ball in their hands.\n* The ball may not be passed back to the goalkeeper when they are positioned in the goal area.\n\nNotable scoring opportunities can occur when attacking players jump into the goal area. For example, an attacking player may catch a pass while launching inside the goal area, and then shoot or pass before touching the floor. ''Doubling'' occurs when a diving attacking player passes to another diving teammate.\n\n===Playing court===\n[[File:Handball field en.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a handball playing field]]\n[[File:Rukometno igrali\u0161te kod Macanovog doma, \u010cakovec.2.jpg|thumb|An outdoor handball playing field]]\nHandball is played on a court {{convert|40|x|20|m|ft}}, with a goal in the centre of each end. The goals are surrounded by a near-semicircular area, called the zone or the crease, defined by a line six meters from the goal. A dashed near-semicircular line nine metres from the goal marks the free-throw line. Each line on the court is part of the area it encompasses. This implies that the middle line belongs to both halves at the same time.\n\n====Goals====\nThe goals are two meters high and three meters wide. They must be securely bolted either to the floor or the wall behind.\n\nThe goal posts and the crossbar must be made out of the same material (e.g., [[wood]] or [[aluminium]]) and feature a quadratic cross section with sides of {{convert|8|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The three sides of the beams visible from the playing field must be painted alternatingly in two contrasting colors which both have to contrast against the background. The colors on both goals must be the same.\n\nEach goal must feature a net. This must be fastened in such a way that a ball thrown into the goal does not leave or pass the goal under normal circumstances. If necessary, a second net may be clasped to the back of the net on the inside.\n\n====D-Zone====\nThe goals are surrounded by the crease. This area is delineated by two quarter circles with a radius of six metres around the far corners of each goal post and a connecting line parallel to the goal line. Only the defending goalkeeper is allowed inside this zone. However, the court players may catch and touch the ball in the air within it as long as the player starts his jump outside the zone and releases the ball before he lands (landing inside the perimeter is allowed in this case as long as the ball has been released).\n\nIf a player without the ball contacts the ground inside the goal perimeter, or the line surrounding the perimeter, he must take the most direct path out of it. However, should a player cross the zone in an attempt to gain an advantage (e.g., better position) their team cedes the ball. Similarly, violation of the zone by a defending player is penalized only if they do so in order to gain an advantage in defending.\n\n====Substitution area====\nOutside of one long edge of the court to both sides of the middle line are the substitution areas for each team. Team officials, substitutes, and suspended players must wait within this area. A team's area is the same side as the goal the team is defending; during halftime, substitution areas are swapped. Any player entering or leaving the play must cross the substitution line which is part of the side line and extends {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} from the middle line to the team's side.\n\n===Duration===\n[[File: Team Time Out Handball.jpg|thumb|Team timeout]] A standard match has two 30-minute halves with a 10- or 15-minute (major Championships/Olympics) halftime intermission. At half-time, teams switch sides of the court as well as benches. For youths, the length of the halves is reduced\u201425 minutes at ages 12 to 15, and 20 minutes at ages 8 to 11; though national federations of some countries may differ in their implementation from the official guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihf.info/files/Uploads/NewsAttachments/0_New-Rules%20of%20the%20Game_GB.pdf|title=Rules of the Game}}</ref>\n\nIf a decision must be reached in a particular match (e.g., in a tournament) and it ends in a draw after regular time, there are at maximum two overtimes, each consisting of two straight 5-minute periods with a one-minute break in between. Should these not decide the game either, the winning team is determined in a penalty shootout (best-of-five rounds; if still tied, extra rounds are added until one team wins).\n\nThe referees may call ''[[Time-out (sport)|timeout]]'' according to their sole discretion; typical reasons are injuries, suspensions, or court cleaning. Penalty throws should trigger a timeout only for lengthy delays, such as a change of the goalkeeper.\n\nSince 2012, teams can call 3 ''team timeouts'' per game (up to two per half), which last one minute each. This right may only be invoked by the team in possession of the ball. Team representatives must show a green card marked with a black ''T'' on the timekeeper's desk. The timekeeper then immediately interrupts the game by sounding an acoustic signal to stop the clock. Before 2012,  teams were allowed only one timeout per half. For the purpose of calling timeouts, overtime and shootouts are extensions of the second half.\n\n===Referees===\nA handball match is adjudicated by two equal referees. Some national bodies allow games with only a single referee in special cases like illness on short notice. Should the referees disagree on any occasion, a decision is made on mutual agreement during a short timeout; or, in case of punishments, the more severe of the two comes into effect. The referees are obliged to make their decisions \"on the basis of their observations of facts\".<ref>Official rules, rule 17:11</ref> Their judgements are final and can be appealed against only if not in compliance with the rules.\n\n[[File:Kronau-Oestringen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The referees (blue shirts) keep both teams between them.]]\n\nThe referees position themselves in such a way that the team players are confined between them. They stand diagonally aligned so that each can observe one side line. Depending on their positions, one is called ''field referee'' and the other ''goal referee''. These positions automatically switch on ball turnover. They physically exchange their positions approximately every 10 minutes (long exchange), and change sides every five minutes (short exchange).\n\nThe IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning is accompanied by a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]].<ref>Official rules, hand signal 16:2</ref> A disqualification for the game is indicated by a [[Penalty card#Red card|red card]],<ref>Official rules 16:7</ref> followed by a [[Penalty card#Blue card|blue card]] if the disqualification will be accompanied by a report.<ref>Official rules 16:8</ref> The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.\n\nThe referees are supported by a ''scorekeeper'' and a ''timekeeper'' who attend to formal things such as keeping track of goals and suspensions, or starting and stopping the clock, respectively. They also keep an eye on the benches and notify the referees on substitution errors. Their desk is located between the two substitution areas.\n\n===Team players, substitutes, and officials===\nEach team consists of seven players on court and seven substitute players on the bench. One player on the court must be the designated goalkeeper, differing in his clothing from the rest of the field players. Substitution of players can be done in any number and at any time during game play. An exchange takes place over the substitution line. A prior notification of the referees is not necessary.\n\nSome national bodies, such as the Deutsche Handball Bund (DHB, \"German Handball Federation\"), allow substitution in junior teams only when in ball possession or during timeouts. This restriction is intended to prevent early specialization of players to offence or defence.\n\n====Field players====\nField players are allowed to touch the ball with any part of their bodies above and including the knee. As in several other team sports, a distinction is made between catching and [[dribbling]]. A player who is in possession of the ball may stand stationary for only three seconds, and may take only three steps. They must then either shoot, pass, or dribble the ball. Taking more than three steps at any time is considered travelling, and results in a turnover. A player may dribble as many times as they want (though, since passing is faster, it is the preferred method of attack), as long as during each dribble the hand contacts only the top of the ball. Therefore, [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying]] is completely prohibited, and results in a turnover. After the dribble is picked up, the player has the right to another three seconds or three steps. The ball must then be passed or shot, as further holding or dribbling will result in a ''double dribble'' turnover and a free throw for the other team. Other offensive infractions that result in a turnover include charging and setting an illegal screen. Carrying the ball into the six-meter zone results either in ball possession by the goalkeeper (by attacker) or turnover (by defender).\n\n====Goalkeeper====\nOnly the [[Handball goalkeeper|goalkeepers]] are allowed to move freely within the goal perimeter, although they may not cross the goal perimeter line while carrying or dribbling the ball. Within the zone, they are allowed to touch the ball with all parts of their bodies, including their feet, with a defensive aim (for other actions, they are subject to the same restrictions as the field players). The goalkeepers may participate in the normal play of their teammates. They may be substituted by a regular field player if their team elects to use this scheme in order to outnumber the defending players. Earlier, this field player become the designated goalkeeper on the court; and had to wear some vest or bib to be identified as such. That shirt had to be equal in colour and form to the goalkeeper's shirt, to avoid confusion. A rule change meant to make the game more offensive now allows any player to substitute with the goalkeeper. The new rule resembles the one used in ice hockey. This rule was first used in the women's world championship in December 2015 and has since been used by the men's European championship in January 2016 and by both genders in the Olympic tournament in Rio in 2016.\n\nIf either goalkeeper deflects the ball over the outer goal line, their team stays in possession of the ball, in contrast to other sports like [[Association football|football]]. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from within the zone (\"goalkeeper throw\"). Passing to one's own goalkeeper results in a turnover. In a penalty shot, throwing the ball against the head of a goalkeeper who is not moving risks a direct disqualification (\"red card\").\n\nOutside of own D-zone, the goalkeeper is treated as a current field player, and has to follow field players' rules; holding or tackling an opponent player outside the area risks a direct disqualification.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The goalkeeper may not return to the area with the ball.\n\n====Team officials====\nEach team is allowed to have a maximum of four team officials seated on the benches. An official is anybody who is neither player nor substitute. One official must be the designated representative who is usually the [[Coach (sport)|team manager]]. Since 2012, representatives can call up to 3 team timeouts (up to twice per half), and may address the scorekeeper, timekeeper, and referees (before that, it was once per half); overtime and shootouts are considered extensions of the second half. Other officials typically include [[physician]]s or managers. Neither official is allowed to enter the playing court without the permission of the referees.\n\n===Ball===\n[[File:Handball the ball.jpg|thumb|A size III handball]] The ball is spherical and must be made either of leather or a synthetic material. It is not allowed to have a shiny or slippery surface. As the ball is intended to be operated by a single hand, its official sizes vary depending on age and gender of the participating teams.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"column\"| Size\n!scope=\"column\"| Class\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (cm)\n!scope=\"column\"| Circumference <br /> (in)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (g)\n!scope=\"column\"| Weight <br /> (oz)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n| Male over-16s\n|{{convert|58|\u2013|60|cm|in|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|425|\u2013|475|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n| Women, male over-12s, and female over-14s\n| {{convert|54|\u2013|56|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|325|\u2013|375|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n| Over-8s\n| {{convert|50|\u2013|52|cm|in|disp=table}}\n| {{convert|290|\u2013|330|g|oz|disp=table}}\n|}\n\n===Awarded throws===\nThe referees may award a special throw to a team. This usually happens after certain events such as scored goals, off-court balls, turnovers and timeouts. All of these special throws require the thrower to obtain a certain position, and pose restrictions on the positions of all other players. Sometimes the execution must wait for a whistle blow by the referee.\n\n;Throw-off: A throw-off takes place from the center of the court. The thrower must touch the middle line with one foot, and all the other offensive players must stay in their half until the referee restarts the game. The defending players must keep a distance of at least three meters from the thrower until the ball leaves his hand. A throw-off occurs at the beginning of each period and after the opposing team scores a goal. It must be cleared by the referees.\n\n:Modern handball introduced the \"fast throw-off\" concept; i.e., the play will be immediately restarted by the referees as soon as the executing team fulfills its requirements. Many teams leverage this rule to score easy goals before the opposition has time to form a stable defense line.\n\n;Throw-in: The team which did not touch the ball last is awarded a throw-in when the ball fully crosses the side line or touches the ceiling. If the ball crosses the outer goal line, a throw-in is awarded only if the defending field players touched the ball last. Execution requires the thrower to place one foot on the nearest outer line to the cause. All defending players must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}. However, they are allowed to stand immediately outside their own goal area even when the distance is less than three meters.\n\n;Goalkeeper-throw: If the ball crosses the outer goal line without interference from the defending team or when deflected by the defending team's goalkeeper, or when the attacking team violates the D-zone as described above, a goalkeeper-throw is awarded to the defending team. This is the most common turnover. The goalkeeper resumes the play with a throw from anywhere within the goal area.\n\n;Free-throw: A free-throw restarts the play after an interruption by the referees. It takes places from the spot where the interruption was caused, as long as this spot is outside of the free-throw line of the opposing team. In the latter case, the throw is deferred to the nearest spot on the free-throw line. Free-throws are the equivalent to [[Direct free kick|free-kicks]] in association football; however, conceding them is typically not seen as poor sportsmanship for the defending side, and in itself, they carry no major disadvantages. (In particular, being awarded a free throw while being on warning for passive play will not reset the warning, whereas a shot on goal will.)  The thrower may take a direct attempt for a goal which, however, is rarely feasible if the defending team has organised a defense. However, if a free throw is awarded and the half or game ends, a direct throw at the goal is typically attempted, which occasionally goes in.\n\n[[File:Kr-Oe-Siebenmeter.jpg|thumb|A seven-metre throw]]\n;Seven-meter throw: A seven-meter throw is awarded when a clear chance of scoring is illegally prevented anywhere on the court by an opposing team player, official, or spectator. It is awarded also when the referees have interrupted a legitimate scoring chance for any reason. The thrower steps with one foot behind the {{Convert|7|m|adj=on|spell=in}} line with only the defending goalkeeper between him and the goal. The goalkeeper must keep a distance of {{Convert|3|m|spell=in}}, which is marked by a short tick on the floor. All other players must remain behind the free-throw line until execution and the defending field players must keep a distance of three meters. The thrower must await the whistle blow of the referee. A seven-meter throw is the equivalent to a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] in association football; however, it is far more common and typically occurs several times in a single game.\n\n===Penalties===\n[[File:Yellow card handball.jpg|thumb|right|Yellow card shown in a handball match]]\nPenalties are given to players, in progressive format, for fouls that require more punishment than just a free-throw. Actions directed mainly at the opponent and not the ball (such as reaching around, holding, pushing, tripping, and jumping into opponent) as well as contact from the side, from behind a player or impeding the opponent's counterattack are all considered illegal and are subject to penalty. Any infraction that prevents a clear scoring opportunity will result in a seven-meter penalty shot.\n\nTypically the referee will give a warning yellow card for an illegal action; but, if the contact was particularly dangerous, like striking the opponent in the head, neck or throat, the referee can forego the warning for an immediate two-minute suspension. Players are warned once before given a yellow card; they risk being red-carded if they draw three yellows.\n\nA red card results in an ejection from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during a fast break is now being treated with a red card; as does any deliberate intent to injure opponents. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes; however, the player is not the one punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with one fewer player than the opposing team.\n\nAfter referees award the ball to the opponents for whatever reason, the player currently in possession of the ball has to lay it down quickly, or risk a two-minute suspension. Also, gesticulating or verbally questioning the referee's order, as well as arguing with the officials' decisions, will normally risk a yellow card. If the suspended player protests further, does not walk straight off the field to the bench, or if the referee deems the tempo deliberately slow, that player risks a double yellow card. Illegal substitution (outside of the dedicated area, or if the replacement player enters too early) is prohibited; if they do, they risk a yellow card.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Formations===\n[[File:5-1-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 5-1 defense formation]]\n[[File:6-0-Deckung.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Positions of attacking (red) and defending players (blue), in a 6-0 defense formation]]\nPlayers are typically referred to by the positions they are playing. The positions are always denoted from the view of the respective goalkeeper, so that a defender on the right opposes an attacker on the left. However, not all of the following positions may be occupied depending on the formation or potential suspensions.\n\n====Offense====\n* Left and right wingman.These typically are fast players who excel at ball control and wide jumps from the outside of the goal perimeter in order to get into a better shooting angle at the goal. Teams usually try to occupy the left position with a right-handed player and vice versa.\n* Left and right backcourt. Goal attempts by these players are typically made by jumping high and shooting over the defenders. Thus, it is usually advantageous to have tall players with a powerful shot for these positions.\n* Centre backcourt. A player with experience is preferred on this position who acts as playmaker and the handball equivalent of a basketball [[point guard]].\n* Pivot (left and right, if applicable). This player tends to intermingle with the defence, setting picks and attempting to disrupt the defence's formation. This position requires the least jumping skills; but ball control and physical strength are an advantage.\n\nSometimes, the offense uses formations with two pivot players.\n\n====Defense====\nThere are many variations in defensive formations. Usually, they are described as ''n:m'' formations, where ''n'' is the number of players defending at the goal line and ''m'' the number of players defending more offensive. Exceptions are the 3:2:1 defense and n+m formation (e.g. 5+1), where m players defend some offensive player in man coverage (instead of the usual zone coverage).\n* Far left and far right. The opponents of the wingmen.\n* Half left and half right. The opponents of the left and right backcourts.\n* Back center (left and right). Opponent of the pivot.\n* Front center. Opponent of the center backcourt, may also be set against another specific backcourt player.\n\n===Offensive play===\nAttacks are played with all field players on the side of the defenders. Depending on the speed of the attack, one distinguishes between three attack ''waves'' with a decreasing chance of success:\n\n[[File:Mara Friton Handball.jpg|thumb|Women's handball - a jump shot completes a fast-break]]\n[[File:Kiril Lazarov 09.jpg|thumb|Men's handball - a jump shot ([[Kiril Lazarov]], world record-holder for the number of goals scored in one world championship) ]]\n;First wave: ''First wave'' attacks are characterised by the absence of defending players around their goal perimeter. The chance of success is very high, as the throwing player is unhindered in his scoring attempt. Such attacks typically occur after an intercepted pass or a steal, and if the defending team can switch fast to offence. The far left or far right will usually try to run the attack, as they are not as tightly bound in the defence. On a turnover, they immediately sprint forward and receive the ball halfway to the other goal. Thus, these positions are commonly held by quick players.\n;Second wave: If the first wave is not successful and some defending players have gained their positions around the zone, the second wave comes into play: the remaining players advance with quick passes to locally outnumber the retreating defenders. If one player manages to step up to the perimeter or catches the ball at this spot, he becomes unstoppable by legal defensive means. From this position, the chance of success is naturally very high. Second wave attacks became much more important with the \"fast throw-off\" rule.\n\n;Third wave: The time during which the second wave may be successful is very short, as then the defenders closed the gaps around the zone. In the ''third wave'', the attackers use standardised attack patterns usually involving crossing and passing between the back court players who either try to pass the ball through a gap to their pivot, take a jumping shot from the backcourt at the goal, or lure the defence away from a wingman.\n\nThe third wave evolves into the normal offensive play when all defenders not only reach the zone, but gain their accustomed positions. Some teams then substitute specialised offence players. However, this implies that these players must play in the defence should the opposing team be able to switch quickly to offence. The latter is another benefit for fast playing teams.\n\nIf the attacking team does not make sufficient progress (eventually releasing a shot on goal), the referees can call '''passive play''' (since about 1995, the referee gives a passive warning some time before the actual call by holding one hand up in the air, signalling that the attacking team should release a shot soon), turning control over to the other team. A shot on goal or an infringement leading to a yellow card or two-minute penalty will mark the start of a new attack, causing the hand to be taken down; but a shot blocked by the defense or a normal free throw will not. If it were not for this rule, it would be easy for an attacking team to stall the game indefinitely, as it is difficult to intercept a pass without at the same time conceding dangerous openings towards the goal.\n\n===Defensive play===\nThe usual formations of the defense are 6\u20130, when all the defense players line up between the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} and {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} lines to form a wall; the 5\u20131, when one of the players cruises outside the {{Convert|9|m|adj=on}} perimeter, usually targeting the center forwards while the other 5 line up on the {{Convert|6|m|adj=on}} line; and the less common 4\u20132 when there are two such defenders out front. Very fast teams will also try a 3\u20133 formation which is close to a switching man-to-man style. The formations vary greatly from country to country, and reflect each country's style of play. 6\u20130 is sometimes known as \"flat defense\", and all other formations are usually called \"offensive defense\".\n\n==Organization==\nHandball teams are usually organised as [[sports club|clubs]]. On a national level, the clubs are associated in federations which organize matches in leagues and tournaments.\n\n===International body===\nThe [[International Handball Federation]] (IHF) is the administrative and controlling body for international handball.

{"title_page": "Thermodynamic equilibrium", "text_new": "{{short description|State of thermodynamic system(s) where no net macroscopic flow of matter or energy occurs}}\n'''Thermodynamic equilibrium''' is an [[axiomatic]] concept of [[thermodynamics]]. It is an internal [[State variables|state]] of a single [[thermodynamic system]], or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable [[Thermodynamic system#Walls|walls]]. In thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net [[macroscopic]] [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] of [[matter]] or of [[energy]], either within a system or between systems. \n\nIn a system that is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, no [[macroscopic]] change occurs. \n\nSystems in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium are simultaneously in mutual [[Thermal equilibrium|thermal]], [[Mechanical equilibrium|mechanical]], [[Chemical equilibrium|chemical]], and [[Radiative equilibrium|radiative]] equilibria. Systems can be in one kind of mutual equilibrium, though not in others. In thermodynamic equilibrium, all kinds of equilibrium hold at once and indefinitely, until disturbed by a [[thermodynamic operation]]. In a macroscopic equilibrium, perfectly or almost perfectly balanced microscopic exchanges occur; this is the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium. \n\nA thermodynamic system in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium has a spatially uniform [[temperature]]. Its [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive properties]], other than temperature, may be driven to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging long-range force field imposed on it by its surroundings.\n\nIn systems that are at a state of [[non-equilibrium]] there are, by contrast, net flows of matter or energy. If such changes can be triggered to occur in a system in which they are not already occurring, the system is said to be in a '''meta-stable equilibrium'''.\n\nThough not a widely named a \"law,\" it is an [[axiom]] of thermodynamics that there exist states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that when a body of material starts from an equilibrium state, in which, portions of it are held at different states by more or less permeable or impermeable partitions, and a thermodynamic operation removes or makes the partitions more permeable and it is isolated, then it spontaneously reaches its own, new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and this is accompanied by an increase in the sum of the [[entropy|entropies]] of the portions.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}\nClassical thermodynamics deals with states of [[dynamic equilibrium]]. The state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is the one for which some [[thermodynamic potential]] is minimized, or for which the [[entropy]] (''S'') is maximized, for specified conditions. One such potential is the [[Helmholtz free energy]] (''A''), for a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and volume:\n\n:<math>A = U - TS</math>\n\nAnother potential, the [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), is minimized at thermodynamic equilibrium in a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and pressure:\n\n:<math>G = U - TS + PV</math>\n\nwhere ''T'' denotes the absolute thermodynamic temperature, ''P'' the pressure, ''S'' the entropy, ''V'' the volume, and ''U'' the internal energy of the system.\n\nThermodynamic equilibrium is the unique stable stationary state that is approached or eventually reached as the system interacts with its surroundings over a long time. The above-mentioned potentials are mathematically constructed to be the thermodynamic quantities that are minimized under the particular conditions in the specified surroundings.\n\n== Conditions ==\n* For a completely isolated system, ''S'' is maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n* For a system with controlled constant temperature and volume, ''A'' is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n* For a system with controlled constant temperature and pressure, ''G'' is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe various types of equilibriums are achieved as follows:\n*Two systems are in ''thermal equilibrium'' when their [[temperature]]s are the same.\n*Two systems are in ''mechanical equilibrium'' when their [[pressure]]s are the same.\n*Two systems are in ''diffusive equilibrium'' when their [[chemical potential]]s are the same.\n*All [[forces]] are balanced and there is no significant external driving force.\n\n==Relation of exchange equilibrium between systems==\n\nOften the surroundings of a thermodynamic system may also be regarded as another thermodynamic system. In this view, one may consider the system and its surroundings as two systems in mutual contact, with long-range forces also linking them. The enclosure of the system is the surface of contiguity or boundary between the two systems. In the thermodynamic formalism, that surface is regarded as having specific properties of permeability. For example, the surface of contiguity may be supposed to be permeable only to heat, allowing energy to transfer only as heat. Then the two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium when the long-range forces are unchanging in time and the transfer of energy as heat between them has slowed and eventually stopped permanently; this is an example of a contact equilibrium. Other kinds of contact equilibrium are defined by other kinds of specific permeability.<ref name=\"Nster_a\">M\u00fcnster, A. (1970), p. 49.</ref> When two systems are in contact equilibrium with respect to a particular kind of permeability, they have common values of the intensive variable that belongs to that particular kind of permeability. Examples of such intensive variables are temperature, pressure, chemical potential.\n\nA contact equilibrium may be regarded also as an exchange equilibrium. There is a zero balance of rate of transfer of some quantity between the two systems in contact equilibrium. For example, for a wall permeable only to heat, the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite. An adiabatic wall between the two systems is 'permeable' only to energy transferred as work; at mechanical equilibrium the rates of transfer of energy as work between them are equal and opposite. If the wall is a simple wall, then the rates of transfer of volume across it are also equal and opposite; and the pressures on either side of it are equal. If the adiabatic wall is more complicated, with a sort of leverage, having an area-ratio, then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio; this keeps the zero balance of rates of transfer as work.\n\nA radiative exchange can occur between two otherwise separate systems. Radiative exchange equilibrium prevails when the two systems have the same temperature.<ref name=\"Planck 1914 40\">[[Max Planck|Planck. M.]] (1914), p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium of a system==\n\nA collection of matter may be entirely [[Isolated system|isolated]] from its surroundings. If it has been left undisturbed for an indefinitely long time, classical thermodynamics postulates that it is in a state in which no changes occur within it, and there are no flows within it. This is a thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium.<ref>Haase, R. (1971), p. 4.</ref><ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 26.</ref> (This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the \"minus first\" law of thermodynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1119/1.4914528|bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..628M|title = Time and irreversibility in axiomatic thermodynamics|year = 2015|last1 = Marsland|first1 = Robert|last2 = Brown|first2 = Harvey R.|last3 = Valente|first3 = Giovanni|journal = American Journal of Physics|volume = 83|issue = 7|pages = 628\u2013634}}</ref> One textbook<ref>[[George Uhlenbeck|Uhlenbeck, G.E.]], Ford, G.W. (1963), p. 5.</ref> calls it the \"zeroth law\", remarking that the authors think this more befitting that title than its [[Zeroth law of thermodynamics|more customary definition]], which apparently was suggested by [[Ralph H. Fowler|Fowler]].)\n\nSuch states are a principal concern in what is known as classical or equilibrium thermodynamics, for they are the only states of the system that are regarded as well defined in that subject. A system in contact equilibrium with another system can by a [[thermodynamic operation]] be isolated, and upon the event of isolation, no change occurs in it. A system in a relation of contact equilibrium with another system may thus also be regarded as being in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n==Multiple contact equilibrium==\n\nThe thermodynamic formalism allows that a system may have contact with several other systems at once, which may or may not also have mutual contact, the contacts having respectively different permeabilities. If these systems are all jointly isolated from the rest of the world, those of them that are in contact then reach respective contact equilibria with one another.\n\nIf several systems are free of adiabatic walls between each other, but are jointly isolated from the rest of the world, then they reach a state of multiple contact equilibrium, and they have a common temperature, a total internal energy, and a total entropy.<ref name=\"Caratheodory\">Carath\u00e9odory, C. (1909).</ref><ref>Prigogine, I. (1947), p. 48.</ref><ref>Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 128\u2013142.</ref><ref>Tisza, L. (1966), p. 108.</ref> Amongst intensive variables, this is a unique property of temperature. It holds even in the presence of long-range forces. (That is, there is no \"force\" that can maintain temperature discrepancies.) For example, in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium in a vertical gravitational field, the pressure on the top wall is less than that on the bottom wall, but the temperature is the same everywhere.\n\nA thermodynamic operation may occur as an event restricted to the walls that are within the surroundings, directly affecting neither the walls of contact of the system of interest with its surroundings, nor its interior, and occurring  within a definitely limited time. For example, an immovable adiabatic wall may be placed or removed within the surroundings. Consequent upon such an operation restricted to the surroundings, the system may be for a time driven away from its own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Then, according to  the second law of thermodynamics, the whole undergoes changes and eventually reaches a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings. Following Planck, this consequent train of events is called a natural [[thermodynamic process]].<ref>[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949/1967), \u00a7 1.12.</ref> It is allowed in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final states are of thermodynamic equilibrium, even though during the process there is transient departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, when neither the system nor its surroundings are in well defined states of internal equilibrium. A natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of its course. It is thereby radically different from a fictive quasi-static 'process' that proceeds infinitely slowly throughout its course, and is fictively 'reversible'. Classical thermodynamics allows that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium, if the main part of its course is at a finite rate, then it is considered to be natural, and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics, and thereby irreversible. Engineered machines and artificial devices and manipulations are permitted within the surroundings.<ref>Levine, I.N. (1983), p. 40.</ref><ref>Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The allowance of such operations and devices in the surroundings but not in the system is the reason why Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of [[Second law of thermodynamics#Description#Kelvin statement|\"inanimate\" agency]]; a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate.<ref>[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W.]] (1851).</ref>\n\nOtherwise, a thermodynamic operation may directly affect a wall of the system.\n\nIt is often convenient to suppose that some of the surrounding subsystems are so much larger than the system that the process can affect the intensive variables only of the surrounding subsystems, and they are then called reservoirs for relevant intensive variables.\n\n== Local and global equilibrium ==\n\nIt is useful to distinguish between global and local thermodynamic equilibrium. In thermodynamics, exchanges within a system and between the system and the outside are controlled by [[intensive quantity|intensive]] parameters. As an example, [[temperature]] controls [[Heat equation|heat exchanges]]. ''Global thermodynamic equilibrium'' (GTE) means that those [[intensive quantity|intensive]] parameters are homogeneous throughout the whole system, while ''local thermodynamic equilibrium'' (LTE) means that those intensive parameters are varying in space and time, but are varying so slowly that, for any point, one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point.\n\nIf the description of the system requires variations in the intensive parameters that are too large, the very assumptions upon which the definitions of these intensive parameters are based will break down, and the system will be in neither global nor local equilibrium. For example, it takes a certain number of collisions for a particle to equilibrate to its surroundings. If the average distance it has moved during these collisions removes it from the neighborhood it is equilibrating to, it will never equilibrate, and there will be no  LTE. Temperature is, by definition, proportional to the average internal energy of an equilibrated neighborhood. Since there is no equilibrated neighborhood, the concept of temperature doesn't hold, and the temperature becomes undefined.\n\nIt is important to note that this local equilibrium may apply only to a certain subset of particles in the system. For example, LTE is usually applied only to [[mass]]ive particles. In a [[radiation|radiating]] gas, the [[photon]]s being emitted and absorbed by the gas doesn't need to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other or with the massive particles of the gas in order for LTE to exist. In some cases, it is not considered necessary for free electrons to be in equilibrium with the much more massive atoms or molecules for LTE to exist.\n\nAs an example, LTE will exist in a glass of water that contains a melting [[ice cube]]. The temperature inside the glass can be defined at any point, but it is colder near the ice cube than far away from it. If energies of the molecules located near a given point are observed, they will be distributed according to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] for a certain temperature. If the energies of the molecules located near another point are observed, they will be distributed according to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution for another temperature.\n\nLocal thermodynamic equilibrium does not require either local or global stationarity. In other words, each small locality need not have a constant temperature. However, it does require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain its local Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities. A global non-equilibrium state can be stably stationary only if it is maintained by exchanges between the system and the outside. For example, a globally-stable stationary state could be maintained inside the glass of water by continuously adding finely powdered ice into it in order to compensate for the melting, and continuously draining off the meltwater. Natural [[transport phenomena]] may lead a system from local to global thermodynamic equilibrium. Going back to our example, the [[diffusion]] of heat will lead our glass of water toward global thermodynamic equilibrium, a state in which the temperature of the glass is completely homogeneous.<ref>H.R. Griem, 2005</ref>\n\n==Reservations==\n\nCareful and well informed writers about thermodynamics, in their accounts of thermodynamic equilibrium, often enough make provisos or reservations to their statements. Some writers leave such reservations merely implied or more or less unstated.\n\nFor example, one widely cited writer, [[Herbert Callen|H. B. Callen]] writes in this context: \"In actuality, few systems are in absolute and true equilibrium.\" He refers to radioactive processes and remarks that they may take \"cosmic times to complete, [and] generally can be ignored\". He adds \"In practice, the criterion for equilibrium is circular. ''Operationally, a system is in an equilibrium state if its properties are consistently described by thermodynamic theory!''\"<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 15.</ref>\n\nJ.A. Beattie and I. Oppenheim write: \"Insistence on a strict interpretation of the definition of equilibrium would rule out the application of thermodynamics to practically all states of real systems.\"<ref>Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I. (1979), p. 3.</ref>\n\nAnother author, cited by Callen as giving a \"scholarly and rigorous treatment\",<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 485.</ref> and cited by Adkins as having written a \"classic text\",<ref>Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. ''xiii''.</ref> [[Brian Pippard|A.B. Pippard]] writes in that text: \"Given long enough a supercooled vapour will eventually condense, ... . The time involved may be so enormous, however, perhaps 10<sup>100</sup> years or more, ... . For most purposes, provided the rapid change is not artificially stimulated, the systems may be regarded as being in equilibrium.\"<ref>Pippard, A.B. (1957/1966), p. 6.</ref>\n\nAnother author, A. M\u00fcnster, writes in this context. He observes that thermonuclear processes often occur so slowly that they can be ignored in thermodynamics. He comments: \"The concept 'absolute equilibrium' or 'equilibrium with respect to all imaginable processes', has therefore, no physical significance.\" He therefore states that: \"... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\" <ref name=\"Nster\">M\u00fcnster, A. (1970), p. 53.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tisza|L. Tisza]]: \"... in the discussion of phenomena near absolute zero. The absolute predictions of the classical theory become particularly vague because the occurrence of frozen-in nonequilibrium states is very common.\"<ref>Tisza, L. (1966), p. 119.</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system is through contact with the surroundings that allows simultaneous passages of all chemical substances and all kinds of energy. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium may move with uniform acceleration through space but must not change its shape or size while doing so; thus it is defined by a rigid volume in space. It may lie within external fields of force, determined by external factors of far greater extent than the system itself, so that events within the system cannot in an appreciable amount affect the external fields of force. The system can be in thermodynamic equilibrium only if the external force fields are uniform, and are determining its uniform acceleration, or if it lies in a non-uniform force field but is held stationary there by local forces, such as mechanical pressures, on its surface.\n\nThermodynamic equilibrium is a [[primitive notion]] of the theory of thermodynamics. According to [[Philip M. Morse|P.M. Morse]]: \"It should be emphasized that the fact that there are thermodynamic states, ..., and the fact that there are thermodynamic variables which are uniquely specified by the equilibrium state ... are ''not'' conclusions deduced logically from some philosophical first principles. They are conclusions ineluctably drawn from more than two centuries of experiments.\"<ref>[[Philip M. Morse|Morse, P.M.]] (1969), p. 7.</ref> This means that thermodynamic equilibrium is not to be defined solely in terms of other theoretical concepts of thermodynamics. M. Bailyn proposes a fundamental law of thermodynamics that defines and postulates the existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 20.</ref>\n\nTextbook definitions of thermodynamic equilibrium are often stated carefully, with some reservation or other.\n\nFor example, A. M\u00fcnster writes: \"An isolated system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when, in the system, no changes of state are occurring at a measurable rate.\" There are two reservations stated here; the system is isolated; any changes of state are immeasurably slow. He discusses the second proviso by giving an account of a mixture oxygen and hydrogen at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst. M\u00fcnster points out that a thermodynamic equilibrium state is described by fewer macroscopic variables than is any other state of a given system. This is partly, but not entirely, because all flows within and through the system are zero.<ref>M\u00fcnster, A. (1970), p. 52.</ref>\n\nR. Haase's presentation of thermodynamics does not start with a restriction to thermodynamic equilibrium because he intends to allow for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. He considers an arbitrary system with time invariant properties. He tests it for thermodynamic equilibrium by cutting it off from all external influences, except external force fields. If after insulation, nothing changes, he says that the system was in ''equilibrium''.<ref>Haase, R. (1971), pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn a section headed \"Thermodynamic equilibrium\", H.B. Callen defines equilibrium states in a paragraph. He points out that they \"are determined by intrinsic factors\" within the system. They are \"terminal states\", towards which the systems evolve, over time, which may occur with \"glacial slowness\".<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 13.</ref> This statement does not explicitly say that for thermodynamic equilibrium, the system must be isolated; Callen does not spell out what he means by the words \"intrinsic factors\".\n\nAnother textbook writer, C.J. Adkins, explicitly allows thermodynamic equilibrium to occur in a system which is not isolated. His system is, however, closed with respect to transfer of matter. He writes: \"In general, the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium will involve both thermal and work-like interactions with the surroundings.\" He distinguishes such thermodynamic equilibrium from thermal equilibrium, in which only thermal contact is mediating transfer of energy.<ref>Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. ''7''.</ref>\n\nAnother textbook author, [[J.R. Partington]], writes: \"(i) ''An equilibrium state is one which is independent of time''.\" But, referring to systems \"which are only apparently in equilibrium\", he adds : \"Such systems are in states of \u2033false equilibrium.\u2033\" Partington's statement does not explicitly state that the equilibrium refers to an isolated system. Like M\u00fcnster, Partington also refers to the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. He adds a proviso that \"In a true equilibrium state, the smallest change of any external condition which influences the state will produce a small change of state ...\"<ref>Partington, J.R. (1949), p. 161.</ref> This proviso means that thermodynamic equilibrium must be stable against small perturbations; this requirement is essential for the strict meaning of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nA student textbook by F.H. Crawford has a section headed \"Thermodynamic Equilibrium\". It distinguishes several drivers of flows, and then says: \"These are examples of the apparently universal tendency of isolated systems toward a state of complete mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical\u2014or, in a single word, ''thermodynamic\u2014equilibrium.''\"<ref>Crawford, F.H. (1963), p. 5.</ref>\n\nA monograph on classical thermodynamics by H.A. Buchdahl considers the \"equilibrium of a thermodynamic system\", without actually writing the phrase \"thermodynamic equilibrium\". Referring to systems closed to exchange of matter, Buchdahl writes: \"If a system is in a terminal condition which is properly static, it will be said to be in ''equilibrium''.\"<ref>Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 8.</ref> Buchdahl's monograph also discusses amorphous glass, for the purposes of thermodynamic description. It states: \"More precisely, the glass may be regarded as being ''in equilibrium'' so long as experimental tests show that 'slow' transitions are in effect reversible.\"<ref>Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 111.</ref> It is not customary to make this proviso part of the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium, but the converse is usually assumed: that if a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is subject to a sufficiently slow process, that process may be considered to be sufficiently nearly reversible, and the body remains sufficiently nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium during the process.<ref>Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 8.</ref>\n\nA. M\u00fcnster carefully extends his definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for isolated systems by introducing a concept of ''contact equilibrium''. This specifies particular processes that are allowed when considering thermodynamic equilibrium for non-isolated systems, with special concern for open systems, which may gain or lose matter from or to their surroundings. A contact equilibrium is between the system of interest and a system in the surroundings, brought into contact with the system of interest, the contact being through a special kind of wall; for the rest, the whole joint system is isolated. Walls of this special kind were also considered by [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory|C. Carath\u00e9odory]], and are mentioned by other writers also. They are selectively permeable. They may be permeable only to mechanical work, or only to heat, or only to some particular chemical substance. Each contact equilibrium defines an intensive parameter; for example, a wall permeable only to heat defines an empirical temperature. A contact equilibrium can exist for each chemical constituent of the system of interest. In a contact equilibrium, despite the possible exchange through the selectively permeable wall, the system of interest is changeless, as if it were in isolated thermodynamic equilibrium. This scheme follows the general rule that \"... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\" <ref name=\"Nster\" /> Thermodynamic equilibrium for an open system means that, with respect to every relevant kind of selectively permeable wall, contact equilibrium exists when the respective intensive parameters of the system and surroundings are equal.<ref name=\"Nster_a\" /> This definition does not consider the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is through unselective contacts. This definition does not simply state that no current of matter or energy exists in the interior or at the boundaries; but it is compatible with the following definition, which does so state.\n\n[[Mark Zemansky|M. Zemansky]] also distinguishes mechanical, chemical, and thermal equilibrium. He then writes: \"When the conditions for all three types of equilibrium are satisfied, the system is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium\".<ref>[[Mark Zemansky|Zemansky, M.]] (1937/1968), p. 27.</ref>\n\n[[Philip M. Morse|P.M. Morse]] writes that thermodynamics is concerned with \"''states of thermodynamic equilibrium''\". He also uses the phrase \"thermal equilibrium\" while discussing transfer of energy as heat between a body and a heat reservoir in its surroundings, though not explicitly defining a special term 'thermal equilibrium'.<ref>[[Philip M. Morse|Morse, P.M.]] (1969), pp. 6, 37.</ref>\n\nJ.R. Waldram writes of \"a definite thermodynamic state\". He defines the term \"thermal equilibrium\" for a system \"when its observables have ceased to change over time\". But shortly below that definition he writes of a piece of glass that has not yet reached its \"''full'' thermodynamic equilibrium state\".<ref>Waldram, J.R. (1985), p. 5.</ref>\n\nConsidering equilibrium states, M. Bailyn writes: \"Each intensive variable has its own type of equilibrium.\" He then defines thermal equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium, and material equilibrium. Accordingly, he writes: \"If all the intensive variables become uniform, ''thermodynamic equilibrium'' is said to exist.\" He is not here considering the presence of an external force field.<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 21.</ref>\n\n[[John Gamble Kirkwood|J.G. Kirkwood]] and I. Oppenheim define thermodynamic equilibrium as follows: \"A system is in a state of ''thermodynamic equilibrium'' if, during the time period allotted for experimentation, (a) its intensive properties are independent of time and (b) no current of matter or energy exists in its interior or at its boundaries with the surroundings.\" It is evident that they are not restricting the definition to isolated or to closed systems. They do not discuss the possibility of changes that occur with \"glacial slowness\", and proceed beyond the time period allotted for experimentation. They note that for two systems in contact, there exists a small subclass of intensive properties such that if all those of that small subclass are respectively equal, then all respective intensive properties are equal. States of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by this subclass, provided some other conditions are satisfied.<ref>Kirkwood, J.G., Oppenheim, I. (1961), p. 2</ref>\n\n==Characteristics of a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium==\n\n===Homogeneity in the absence of external forces===\nA thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase in the absence of external forces, in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous.<ref name=\"Planck 1903 3\"/> This means that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchanged with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. In general, a strong external force field makes a system of a single phase in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium inhomogeneous with respect to some [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variables]]. For example, a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrated by centrifugation.\n\n===Uniform temperature===\nSuch equilibrium inhomogeneity, induced by external forces, does not occur for the intensive variable [[temperature]]. According to [[Edward A. Guggenheim|E.A. Guggenheim]], \"The most important conception of thermodynamics is temperature.\"<ref>[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949/1967), p.5.</ref> Planck introduces his treatise with a brief account of heat and temperature and thermal equilibrium, and then announces: \"In the following we shall deal chiefly with homogeneous, isotropic bodies of any form, possessing throughout their substance the same temperature and density, and subject to a uniform pressure acting everywhere perpendicular to the surface.\"<ref name=\"Planck 1903 3\">[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1927), p.3.</ref> As did Carath\u00e9odory, Planck was setting aside surface effects and external fields and anisotropic crystals. Though referring to temperature, Planck did not there explicitly refer to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, Carath\u00e9odory's scheme of presentation of classical thermodynamics for closed systems postulates the concept of an \"equilibrium state\" following Gibbs (Gibbs speaks routinely of a \"thermodynamic state\"), though not explicitly using the phrase 'thermodynamic equilibrium', nor explicitly postulating the existence of a temperature to define it.\n\nThe temperature within a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is uniform in space as well as in time. In a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, there are no net internal macroscopic flows. In particular, this means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform.<ref name=\"Planck 1914 40\"/> This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Langrangian multipliers.<ref>Gibbs, J.W.

Carath\u00e9odory initially postulates that experiment reveals that a definite number of real variables define the states that are the points of the manifold of equilibria.<ref name=\"Caratheodory\" /> In the words of Prigogine and Defay (1945): \"It is a matter of experience that when we have specified a certain number of macroscopic properties of a system, then all the other properties are fixed.\"<ref>Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954), p. 1.</ref><ref>Silbey, R.J., [[Robert A. Alberty|Alberty, R.A.]], Bawendi,  M.G. (1955/2005), p. 4.</ref> As noted above, according to A. M\u00fcnster, the number of variables needed to define a thermodynamic equilibrium is the least for any state of a given isolated system. As noted above, J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by a special subclass of intensive variables, with a definite number of members in that subclass.\n\nIf the thermodynamic equilibrium lies in an external force field, it is only the temperature that can in general be expected to be spatially uniform. Intensive variables other than temperature will in general be non-uniform if the external force field is non-zero. In such a case, in general, additional variables are needed to describe the spatial non-uniformity.\n\n===Stability against small perturbations===\nAs noted above, J.R. Partington points out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is stable against small transient perturbations. Without this condition, in general, experiments intended to study systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are in severe difficulties.\n\n===Approach to thermodynamic equilibrium within an isolated system===\n\nWhen a body of material starts from a non-equilibrium state of inhomogeneity or chemical non-equilibrium, and is then isolated, it spontaneously evolves towards its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. It is not necessary that all aspects of internal thermodynamic equilibrium be reached simultaneously; some can be established before others. For example, in many cases of such evolution, internal mechanical equilibrium is established much more rapidly than the other aspects of the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium.<ref name=\"Fitts 43\">Fitts, D.D. (1962), p. 43.</ref> Another example is that, in many cases of such evolution, thermal equilibrium is reached much more rapidly than chemical equilibrium.<ref>Denbigh, K.G. (1951), p. 42.</ref>\n\n===Fluctuations within an isolated system in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium===\n\nIn an isolated system, thermodynamic equilibrium by definition persists over an indefinitely long time. In classical physics it is often convenient to ignore the effects of measurement and this is assumed in the present account.\n\nTo consider the notion of fluctuations in an isolated thermodynamic system, a convenient example is a system specified by its extensive state variables, internal energy, volume, and mass composition. By definition they are time-invariant. By definition, they combine with time-invariant nominal values of their conjugate intensive functions of state, inverse temperature, pressure divided by temperature, and the chemical potentials divided by temperature, so as to exactly obey the laws of thermodynamics.<ref>Tschoegl, N.W. (2000). ''Fundamentals of Equilibrium and Steady-State Thermodynamics'', Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-50426-5}}, p. 21.</ref> But the laws of thermodynamics, combined with the values of the specifying extensive variables of state, are not sufficient to provide knowledge of those nominal values. Further information is needed, namely, of the constitutive properties of the system.\n\nIt may be admitted that on repeated measurement of those conjugate intensive functions of state, they are found to have slightly different values from time to time. Such variability is regarded as due to internal fluctuations. The different measured values average to their nominal values.\n\nIf the system is truly macroscopic as postulated by classical thermodynamics, then the fluctuations are too small to detect macroscopically. This is called the thermodynamic limit. In effect, the molecular nature of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer have vanished from sight, too small to see. According to Buchdahl: \"... there is no place within the strictly phenomenological theory for the idea of fluctuations about equilibrium (see, however, Section 76).\"<ref>Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 16.</ref>\n\nIf the system is repeatedly subdivided, eventually a system is produced that is small enough to exhibit obvious fluctuations. This is a mesoscopic level of investigation. The fluctuations are then directly dependent on the natures of the various walls of the system. The precise choice of independent state variables is then important. At this stage, statistical features of the laws of thermodynamics become apparent.\n\nIf the mesoscopic system is further repeatedly divided, eventually a  microscopic system is produced. Then the molecular character of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer become important in the processes of fluctuation. One has left the realm of classical or macroscopic thermodynamics, and one needs quantum statistical mechanics. The fluctuations can become relatively dominant, and questions of measurement become important.\n\nThe statement that 'the system is its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium' may be taken to mean that 'indefinitely many such measurements have been taken from time to time, with no trend in time in the various measured values'. Thus the statement, that 'a system is in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, with stated nominal values of its functions of state conjugate to its specifying state variables', is far far more informative than a statement that 'a set of single simultaneous measurements of those functions of state have those same values'. This is because the single measurements might have been made during a slight fluctuation, away from another set of nominal values of those conjugate intensive functions of state, that is due to unknown and different constitutive properties. A single measurement cannot tell whether that might be so, unless there is also knowledge of the nominal values that belong to the equilibrium state.\n\n=== Thermal equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Thermal equilibrium}}\n\nAn explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which there are occurring several irreversible processes, entailing non-zero fluxes; the two systems are separated by a wall permeable only to heat. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then \"it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.\"<ref>Eu, B.C. (2002), page 13.</ref> This illustrates the importance for thermodynamics of the concept of temperature.\n\n[[Thermal equilibrium]] is achieved when two systems in [[thermal contact]] with each other cease to have a net exchange of energy. It follows that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium, then their temperatures are the same.<ref>[[Raj Pathria|R. K. Pathria]], 1996</ref>\n\nThermal equilibrium occurs when a system's [[macroscopic]] thermal observables have ceased to change with time.  For example, an [[ideal gas]] whose [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] has stabilised to a specific [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] would be in thermal equilibrium.  This outcome allows a single [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] to be attributed to the whole system. For an isolated body, it is quite possible for mechanical equilibrium to be reached before thermal equilibrium is reached, but eventually, all aspects of equilibrium, including thermal equilibrium, are necessary for thermodynamic equilibrium.<ref>de Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 44.</ref>\n\n==Non-equilibrium==\n{{Main|Non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}\n\nA system's internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium should be distinguished from a \"stationary state\" in which thermodynamic parameters are unchanging in time but the system is not isolated, so that there are, into and out of the system, non-zero macroscopic fluxes which are constant in time.<ref>de Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 43.</ref>\n\nNon-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.\n\nLaws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are also debatable.

It is an internal [[State variables|state]] of a single [[thermodynamic system]], or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable [[Thermodynamic system#Walls|walls]]. In thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net [[macroscopic]] [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] of [[matter]] or of [[energy]], either within a system or between systems. \n\nIn a system that is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, no [[macroscopic]] change occurs. \n\nSystems in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium are simultaneously in mutual [[Thermal equilibrium|thermal]], [[Mechanical equilibrium|mechanical]], [[Chemical equilibrium|chemical]], and [[Radiative equilibrium|radiative]] equilibria. Systems can be in one kind of mutual equilibrium, though not in others. In thermodynamic equilibrium, all kinds of equilibrium hold at once and indefinitely, until disturbed by a [[thermodynamic operation]]. In a macroscopic equilibrium, perfectly or almost perfectly balanced microscopic exchanges occur; this is the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium. \n\nA thermodynamic system in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium has a spatially uniform [[temperature]]. Its [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive properties]], other than temperature, may be driven to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging long-range force field imposed on it by its surroundings.\n\nIn systems that are at a state of [[non-equilibrium]] there are, by contrast, net flows of matter or energy. If such changes can be triggered to occur in a system in which they are not already occurring, the system is said to be in a '''meta-stable equilibrium'''.\n\nThough not a widely named a \"law,\" it is an [[axiom]] of thermodynamics that there exist states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that when a body of material starts from an equilibrium state, in which, portions of it are held at different states by more or less permeable or impermeable partitions, and a thermodynamic operation removes or makes the partitions more permeable and it is isolated, then it spontaneously reaches its own, new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and this is accompanied by an increase in the sum of the [[entropy|entropies]] of the portions.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}\nClassical thermodynamics deals with states of [[dynamic equilibrium]]. The state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is the one for which some [[thermodynamic potential]] is minimized, or for which the [[entropy]] (''S'') is maximized, for specified conditions. One such potential is the [[Helmholtz free energy]] (''A''), for a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and volume:\n\n:<math>A = U - TS</math>\n\nAnother potential, the [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), is minimized at thermodynamic equilibrium in a system with surroundings at controlled constant temperature and pressure:\n\n:<math>G = U - TS + PV</math>\n\nwhere ''T'' denotes the absolute thermodynamic temperature, ''P'' the pressure, ''S'' the entropy, ''V'' the volume, and ''U'' the internal energy of the system.\n\nThermodynamic equilibrium is the unique stable stationary state that is approached or eventually reached as the system interacts with its surroundings over a long time. The above-mentioned potentials are mathematically constructed to be the thermodynamic quantities that are minimized under the particular conditions in the specified surroundings.\n\n== Conditions ==\n* For a completely isolated system, ''S'' is maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n* For a system with controlled constant temperature and volume, ''A'' is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n* For a system with controlled constant temperature and pressure, ''G'' is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nThe various types of equilibriums are achieved as follows:\n*Two systems are in ''thermal equilibrium'' when their [[temperature]]s are the same.\n*Two systems are in ''mechanical equilibrium'' when their [[pressure]]s are the same.\n*Two systems are in ''diffusive equilibrium'' when their [[chemical potential]]s are the same.\n*All [[forces]] are balanced and there is no significant external driving force.\n\n==Relation of exchange equilibrium between systems==\n\nOften the surroundings of a thermodynamic system may also be regarded as another thermodynamic system. In this view, one may consider the system and its surroundings as two systems in mutual contact, with long-range forces also linking them. The enclosure of the system is the surface of contiguity or boundary between the two systems. In the thermodynamic formalism, that surface is regarded as having specific properties of permeability. For example, the surface of contiguity may be supposed to be permeable only to heat, allowing energy to transfer only as heat. Then the two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium when the long-range forces are unchanging in time and the transfer of energy as heat between them has slowed and eventually stopped permanently; this is an example of a contact equilibrium. Other kinds of contact equilibrium are defined by other kinds of specific permeability.<ref name=\"Nster_a\">M\u00fcnster, A. (1970), p. 49.</ref> When two systems are in contact equilibrium with respect to a particular kind of permeability, they have common values of the intensive variable that belongs to that particular kind of permeability. Examples of such intensive variables are temperature, pressure, chemical potential.\n\nA contact equilibrium may be regarded also as an exchange equilibrium. There is a zero balance of rate of transfer of some quantity between the two systems in contact equilibrium. For example, for a wall permeable only to heat, the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite. An adiabatic wall between the two systems is 'permeable' only to energy transferred as work; at mechanical equilibrium the rates of transfer of energy as work between them are equal and opposite. If the wall is a simple wall, then the rates of transfer of volume across it are also equal and opposite; and the pressures on either side of it are equal. If the adiabatic wall is more complicated, with a sort of leverage, having an area-ratio, then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio; this keeps the zero balance of rates of transfer as work.\n\nA radiative exchange can occur between two otherwise separate systems. Radiative exchange equilibrium prevails when the two systems have the same temperature.<ref name=\"Planck 1914 40\">[[Max Planck|Planck. M.]] (1914), p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium of a system==\n\nA collection of matter may be entirely [[Isolated system|isolated]] from its surroundings. If it has been left undisturbed for an indefinitely long time, classical thermodynamics postulates that it is in a state in which no changes occur within it, and there are no flows within it. This is a thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium.<ref>Haase, R. (1971), p. 4.</ref><ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 26.</ref> (This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the \"minus first\" law of thermodynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1119/1.4914528|bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..628M|title = Time and irreversibility in axiomatic thermodynamics|year = 2015|last1 = Marsland|first1 = Robert|last2 = Brown|first2 = Harvey R.|last3 = Valente|first3 = Giovanni|journal = American Journal of Physics|volume = 83|issue = 7|pages = 628\u2013634}}</ref> One textbook<ref>[[George Uhlenbeck|Uhlenbeck, G.E.]], Ford, G.W. (1963), p. 5.</ref> calls it the \"zeroth law\", remarking that the authors think this more befitting that title than its [[Zeroth law of thermodynamics|more customary definition]], which apparently was suggested by [[Ralph H. Fowler|Fowler]].)\n\nSuch states are a principal concern in what is known as classical or equilibrium thermodynamics, for they are the only states of the system that are regarded as well defined in that subject. A system in contact equilibrium with another system can by a [[thermodynamic operation]] be isolated, and upon the event of isolation, no change occurs in it. A system in a relation of contact equilibrium with another system may thus also be regarded as being in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\n==Multiple contact equilibrium==\n\nThe thermodynamic formalism allows that a system may have contact with several other systems at once, which may or may not also have mutual contact, the contacts having respectively different permeabilities. If these systems are all jointly isolated from the rest of the world, those of them that are in contact then reach respective contact equilibria with one another.\n\nIf several systems are free of adiabatic walls between each other, but are jointly isolated from the rest of the world, then they reach a state of multiple contact equilibrium, and they have a common temperature, a total internal energy, and a total entropy.<ref name=\"Caratheodory\">Carath\u00e9odory, C. (1909).</ref><ref>Prigogine, I. (1947), p. 48.</ref><ref>Landsberg, P. T. (1961), pp. 128\u2013142.</ref><ref>Tisza, L. (1966), p. 108.</ref> Amongst intensive variables, this is a unique property of temperature. It holds even in the presence of long-range forces. (That is, there is no \"force\" that can maintain temperature discrepancies.) For example, in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium in a vertical gravitational field, the pressure on the top wall is less than that on the bottom wall, but the temperature is the same everywhere.\n\nA thermodynamic operation may occur as an event restricted to the walls that are within the surroundings, directly affecting neither the walls of contact of the system of interest with its surroundings, nor its interior, and occurring  within a definitely limited time. For example, an immovable adiabatic wall may be placed or removed within the surroundings. Consequent upon such an operation restricted to the surroundings, the system may be for a time driven away from its own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Then, according to  the second law of thermodynamics, the whole undergoes changes and eventually reaches a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings. Following Planck, this consequent train of events is called a natural [[thermodynamic process]].<ref>[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949/1967), \u00a7 1.12.</ref> It is allowed in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final states are of thermodynamic equilibrium, even though during the process there is transient departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, when neither the system nor its surroundings are in well defined states of internal equilibrium. A natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of its course. It is thereby radically different from a fictive quasi-static 'process' that proceeds infinitely slowly throughout its course, and is fictively 'reversible'. Classical thermodynamics allows that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium, if the main part of its course is at a finite rate, then it is considered to be natural, and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics, and thereby irreversible. Engineered machines and artificial devices and manipulations are permitted within the surroundings.<ref>Levine, I.N. (1983), p. 40.</ref><ref>Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The allowance of such operations and devices in the surroundings but not in the system is the reason why Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of [[Second law of thermodynamics#Description#Kelvin statement|\"inanimate\" agency]]; a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate.<ref>[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Thomson, W.]] (1851).</ref>\n\nOtherwise, a thermodynamic operation may directly affect a wall of the system.\n\nIt is often convenient to suppose that some of the surrounding subsystems are so much larger than the system that the process can affect the intensive variables only of the surrounding subsystems, and they are then called reservoirs for relevant intensive variables.\n\n== Local and global equilibrium ==\n\nIt is useful to distinguish between global and local thermodynamic equilibrium. In thermodynamics, exchanges within a system and between the system and the outside are controlled by [[intensive quantity|intensive]] parameters. As an example, [[temperature]] controls [[Heat equation|heat exchanges]]. ''Global thermodynamic equilibrium'' (GTE) means that those [[intensive quantity|intensive]] parameters are homogeneous throughout the whole system, while ''local thermodynamic equilibrium'' (LTE) means that those intensive parameters are varying in space and time, but are varying so slowly that, for any point, one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point.\n\nIf the description of the system requires variations in the intensive parameters that are too large, the very assumptions upon which the definitions of these intensive parameters are based will break down, and the system will be in neither global nor local equilibrium. For example, it takes a certain number of collisions for a particle to equilibrate to its surroundings. If the average distance it has moved during these collisions removes it from the neighborhood it is equilibrating to, it will never equilibrate, and there will be no  LTE. Temperature is, by definition, proportional to the average internal energy of an equilibrated neighborhood. Since there is no equilibrated neighborhood, the concept of temperature doesn't hold, and the temperature becomes undefined.\n\nIt is important to note that this local equilibrium may apply only to a certain subset of particles in the system. For example, LTE is usually applied only to [[mass]]ive particles. In a [[radiation|radiating]] gas, the [[photon]]s being emitted and absorbed by the gas doesn't need to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other or with the massive particles of the gas in order for LTE to exist. In some cases, it is not considered necessary for free electrons to be in equilibrium with the much more massive atoms or molecules for LTE to exist.\n\nAs an example, LTE will exist in a glass of water that contains a melting [[ice cube]]. The temperature inside the glass can be defined at any point, but it is colder near the ice cube than far away from it. If energies of the molecules located near a given point are observed, they will be distributed according to the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] for a certain temperature. If the energies of the molecules located near another point are observed, they will be distributed according to the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution for another temperature.\n\nLocal thermodynamic equilibrium does not require either local or global stationarity. In other words, each small locality need not have a constant temperature. However, it does require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain its local Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities. A global non-equilibrium state can be stably stationary only if it is maintained by exchanges between the system and the outside. For example, a globally-stable stationary state could be maintained inside the glass of water by continuously adding finely powdered ice into it in order to compensate for the melting, and continuously draining off the meltwater. Natural [[transport phenomena]] may lead a system from local to global thermodynamic equilibrium. Going back to our example, the [[diffusion]] of heat will lead our glass of water toward global thermodynamic equilibrium, a state in which the temperature of the glass is completely homogeneous.<ref>H.R. Griem, 2005</ref>\n\n==Reservations==\n\nCareful and well informed writers about thermodynamics, in their accounts of thermodynamic equilibrium, often enough make provisos or reservations to their statements. Some writers leave such reservations merely implied or more or less unstated.\n\nFor example, one widely cited writer, [[Herbert Callen|H. B. Callen]] writes in this context: \"In actuality, few systems are in absolute and true equilibrium.\" He refers to radioactive processes and remarks that they may take \"cosmic times to complete, [and] generally can be ignored\". He adds \"In practice, the criterion for equilibrium is circular. ''Operationally, a system is in an equilibrium state if its properties are consistently described by thermodynamic theory!''\"<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 15.</ref>\n\nJ.A. Beattie and I. Oppenheim write: \"Insistence on a strict interpretation of the definition of equilibrium would rule out the application of thermodynamics to practically all states of real systems.\"<ref>Beattie, J.A., Oppenheim, I. (1979), p. 3.</ref>\n\nAnother author, cited by Callen as giving a \"scholarly and rigorous treatment\",<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 485.</ref> and cited by Adkins as having written a \"classic text\",<ref>Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. ''xiii''.</ref> [[Brian Pippard|A.B. Pippard]] writes in that text: \"Given long enough a supercooled vapour will eventually condense, ... . The time involved may be so enormous, however, perhaps 10<sup>100</sup> years or more, ... . For most purposes, provided the rapid change is not artificially stimulated, the systems may be regarded as being in equilibrium.\"<ref>Pippard, A.B. (1957/1966), p. 6.</ref>\n\nAnother author, A. M\u00fcnster, writes in this context. He observes that thermonuclear processes often occur so slowly that they can be ignored in thermodynamics. He comments: \"The concept 'absolute equilibrium' or 'equilibrium with respect to all imaginable processes', has therefore, no physical significance.\" He therefore states that: \"... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\" <ref name=\"Nster\">M\u00fcnster, A. (1970), p. 53.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tisza|L. Tisza]]: \"... in the discussion of phenomena near absolute zero. The absolute predictions of the classical theory become particularly vague because the occurrence of frozen-in nonequilibrium states is very common.\"<ref>Tisza, L. (1966), p. 119.</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\n\nThe most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system is through contact with the surroundings that allows simultaneous passages of all chemical substances and all kinds of energy. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium may move with uniform acceleration through space but must not change its shape or size while doing so; thus it is defined by a rigid volume in space. It may lie within external fields of force, determined by external factors of far greater extent than the system itself, so that events within the system cannot in an appreciable amount affect the external fields of force. The system can be in thermodynamic equilibrium only if the external force fields are uniform, and are determining its uniform acceleration, or if it lies in a non-uniform force field but is held stationary there by local forces, such as mechanical pressures, on its surface.\n\nThermodynamic equilibrium is a [[primitive notion]] of the theory of thermodynamics. According to [[Philip M. Morse|P.M. Morse]]: \"It should be emphasized that the fact that there are thermodynamic states, ..., and the fact that there are thermodynamic variables which are uniquely specified by the equilibrium state ... are ''not'' conclusions deduced logically from some philosophical first principles. They are conclusions ineluctably drawn from more than two centuries of experiments.\"<ref>[[Philip M. Morse|Morse, P.M.]] (1969), p. 7.</ref> This means that thermodynamic equilibrium is not to be defined solely in terms of other theoretical concepts of thermodynamics. M. Bailyn proposes a fundamental law of thermodynamics that defines and postulates the existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 20.</ref>\n\nTextbook definitions of thermodynamic equilibrium are often stated carefully, with some reservation or other.\n\nFor example, A. M\u00fcnster writes: \"An isolated system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when, in the system, no changes of state are occurring at a measurable rate.\" There are two reservations stated here; the system is isolated; any changes of state are immeasurably slow. He discusses the second proviso by giving an account of a mixture oxygen and hydrogen at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst. M\u00fcnster points out that a thermodynamic equilibrium state is described by fewer macroscopic variables than is any other state of a given system. This is partly, but not entirely, because all flows within and through the system are zero.<ref>M\u00fcnster, A. (1970), p. 52.</ref>\n\nR. Haase's presentation of thermodynamics does not start with a restriction to thermodynamic equilibrium because he intends to allow for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. He considers an arbitrary system with time invariant properties. He tests it for thermodynamic equilibrium by cutting it off from all external influences, except external force fields. If after insulation, nothing changes, he says that the system was in ''equilibrium''.<ref>Haase, R. (1971), pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn a section headed \"Thermodynamic equilibrium\", H.B. Callen defines equilibrium states in a paragraph. He points out that they \"are determined by intrinsic factors\" within the system. They are \"terminal states\", towards which the systems evolve, over time, which may occur with \"glacial slowness\".<ref>Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 13.</ref> This statement does not explicitly say that for thermodynamic equilibrium, the system must be isolated; Callen does not spell out what he means by the words \"intrinsic factors\".\n\nAnother textbook writer, C.J. Adkins, explicitly allows thermodynamic equilibrium to occur in a system which is not isolated. His system is, however, closed with respect to transfer of matter. He writes: \"In general, the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium will involve both thermal and work-like interactions with the surroundings.\" He distinguishes such thermodynamic equilibrium from thermal equilibrium, in which only thermal contact is mediating transfer of energy.<ref>Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. ''7''.</ref>\n\nAnother textbook author, [[J.R. Partington]], writes: \"(i) ''An equilibrium state is one which is independent of time''.\" But, referring to systems \"which are only apparently in equilibrium\", he adds : \"Such systems are in states of \u2033false equilibrium.\u2033\" Partington's statement does not explicitly state that the equilibrium refers to an isolated system. Like M\u00fcnster, Partington also refers to the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. He adds a proviso that \"In a true equilibrium state, the smallest change of any external condition which influences the state will produce a small change of state ...\"<ref>Partington, J.R. (1949), p. 161.</ref> This proviso means that thermodynamic equilibrium must be stable against small perturbations; this requirement is essential for the strict meaning of thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nA student textbook by F.H. Crawford has a section headed \"Thermodynamic Equilibrium\". It distinguishes several drivers of flows, and then says: \"These are examples of the apparently universal tendency of isolated systems toward a state of complete mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical\u2014or, in a single word, ''thermodynamic\u2014equilibrium.''\"<ref>Crawford, F.H. (1963), p. 5.</ref>\n\nA monograph on classical thermodynamics by H.A. Buchdahl considers the \"equilibrium of a thermodynamic system\", without actually writing the phrase \"thermodynamic equilibrium\". Referring to systems closed to exchange of matter, Buchdahl writes: \"If a system is in a terminal condition which is properly static, it will be said to be in ''equilibrium''.\"<ref>Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 8.</ref> Buchdahl's monograph also discusses amorphous glass, for the purposes of thermodynamic description. It states: \"More precisely, the glass may be regarded as being ''in equilibrium'' so long as experimental tests show that 'slow' transitions are in effect reversible.\"<ref>Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 111.</ref> It is not customary to make this proviso part of the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium, but the converse is usually assumed: that if a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is subject to a sufficiently slow process, that process may be considered to be sufficiently nearly reversible, and the body remains sufficiently nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium during the process.<ref>Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 8.</ref>\n\nA. M\u00fcnster carefully extends his definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for isolated systems by introducing a concept of ''contact equilibrium''. This specifies particular processes that are allowed when considering thermodynamic equilibrium for non-isolated systems, with special concern for open systems, which may gain or lose matter from or to their surroundings. A contact equilibrium is between the system of interest and a system in the surroundings, brought into contact with the system of interest, the contact being through a special kind of wall; for the rest, the whole joint system is isolated. Walls of this special kind were also considered by [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory|C. Carath\u00e9odory]], and are mentioned by other writers also. They are selectively permeable. They may be permeable only to mechanical work, or only to heat, or only to some particular chemical substance. Each contact equilibrium defines an intensive parameter; for example, a wall permeable only to heat defines an empirical temperature. A contact equilibrium can exist for each chemical constituent of the system of interest. In a contact equilibrium, despite the possible exchange through the selectively permeable wall, the system of interest is changeless, as if it were in isolated thermodynamic equilibrium. This scheme follows the general rule that \"... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\" <ref name=\"Nster\" /> Thermodynamic equilibrium for an open system means that, with respect to every relevant kind of selectively permeable wall, contact equilibrium exists when the respective intensive parameters of the system and surroundings are equal.<ref name=\"Nster_a\" /> This definition does not consider the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is through unselective contacts. This definition does not simply state that no current of matter or energy exists in the interior or at the boundaries; but it is compatible with the following definition, which does so state.\n\n[[Mark Zemansky|M. Zemansky]] also distinguishes mechanical, chemical, and thermal equilibrium. He then writes: \"When the conditions for all three types of equilibrium are satisfied, the system is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium\".<ref>[[Mark Zemansky|Zemansky, M.]] (1937/1968), p. 27.</ref>\n\n[[Philip M. Morse|P.M. Morse]] writes that thermodynamics is concerned with \"''states of thermodynamic equilibrium''\". He also uses the phrase \"thermal equilibrium\" while discussing transfer of energy as heat between a body and a heat reservoir in its surroundings, though not explicitly defining a special term 'thermal equilibrium'.<ref>[[Philip M. Morse|Morse, P.M.]] (1969), pp. 6, 37.</ref>\n\nJ.R. Waldram writes of \"a definite thermodynamic state\". He defines the term \"thermal equilibrium\" for a system \"when its observables have ceased to change over time\". But shortly below that definition he writes of a piece of glass that has not yet reached its \"''full'' thermodynamic equilibrium state\".<ref>Waldram, J.R. (1985), p. 5.</ref>\n\nConsidering equilibrium states, M. Bailyn writes: \"Each intensive variable has its own type of equilibrium.\" He then defines thermal equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium, and material equilibrium. Accordingly, he writes: \"If all the intensive variables become uniform, ''thermodynamic equilibrium'' is said to exist.\" He is not here considering the presence of an external force field.<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 21.</ref>\n\n[[John Gamble Kirkwood|J.G. Kirkwood]] and I. Oppenheim define thermodynamic equilibrium as follows: \"A system is in a state of ''thermodynamic equilibrium'' if, during the time period allotted for experimentation, (a) its intensive properties are independent of time and (b) no current of matter or energy exists in its interior or at its boundaries with the surroundings.\" It is evident that they are not restricting the definition to isolated or to closed systems. They do not discuss the possibility of changes that occur with \"glacial slowness\", and proceed beyond the time period allotted for experimentation. They note that for two systems in contact, there exists a small subclass of intensive properties such that if all those of that small subclass are respectively equal, then all respective intensive properties are equal. States of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by this subclass, provided some other conditions are satisfied.<ref>Kirkwood, J.G., Oppenheim, I. (1961), p. 2</ref>\n\n==Characteristics of a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium==\n\n===Homogeneity in the absence of external forces===\nA thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase in the absence of external forces, in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous.<ref name=\"Planck 1903 3\"/> This means that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchanged with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. In general, a strong external force field makes a system of a single phase in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium inhomogeneous with respect to some [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variables]]. For example, a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrated by centrifugation.\n\n===Uniform temperature===\nSuch equilibrium inhomogeneity, induced by external forces, does not occur for the intensive variable [[temperature]]. According to [[Edward A. Guggenheim|E.A. Guggenheim]], \"The most important conception of thermodynamics is temperature.\"<ref>[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949/1967), p.5.</ref> Planck introduces his treatise with a brief account of heat and temperature and thermal equilibrium, and then announces: \"In the following we shall deal chiefly with homogeneous, isotropic bodies of any form, possessing throughout their substance the same temperature and density, and subject to a uniform pressure acting everywhere perpendicular to the surface.\"<ref name=\"Planck 1903 3\">[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1927), p.3.</ref> As did Carath\u00e9odory, Planck was setting aside surface effects and external fields and anisotropic crystals. Though referring to temperature, Planck did not there explicitly refer to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, Carath\u00e9odory's scheme of presentation of classical thermodynamics for closed systems postulates the concept of an \"equilibrium state\" following Gibbs (Gibbs speaks routinely of a \"thermodynamic state\"), though not explicitly using the phrase 'thermodynamic equilibrium', nor explicitly postulating the existence of a temperature to define it.\n\nThe temperature within a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is uniform in space as well as in time. In a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, there are no net internal macroscopic flows. In particular, this means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform.<ref name=\"Planck 1914 40\"/> This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Langrangian multipliers.<ref>Gibbs, J.W.

Carath\u00e9odory initially postulates that experiment reveals that a definite number of real variables define the states that are the points of the manifold of equilibria.<ref name=\"Caratheodory\" /> In the words of Prigogine and Defay (1945): \"It is a matter of experience that when we have specified a certain number of macroscopic properties of a system, then all the other properties are fixed.\"<ref>Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954), p. 1.</ref><ref>Silbey, R.J., [[Robert A. Alberty|Alberty, R.A.]], Bawendi,  M.G. (1955/2005), p. 4.</ref> As noted above, according to A. M\u00fcnster, the number of variables needed to define a thermodynamic equilibrium is the least for any state of a given isolated system. As noted above, J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by a special subclass of intensive variables, with a definite number of members in that subclass.\n\nIf the thermodynamic equilibrium lies in an external force field, it is only the temperature that can in general be expected to be spatially uniform. Intensive variables other than temperature will in general be non-uniform if the external force field is non-zero. In such a case, in general, additional variables are needed to describe the spatial non-uniformity.\n\n===Stability against small perturbations===\nAs noted above, J.R. Partington points out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is stable against small transient perturbations. Without this condition, in general, experiments intended to study systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are in severe difficulties.\n\n===Approach to thermodynamic equilibrium within an isolated system===\n\nWhen a body of material starts from a non-equilibrium state of inhomogeneity or chemical non-equilibrium, and is then isolated, it spontaneously evolves towards its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. It is not necessary that all aspects of internal thermodynamic equilibrium be reached simultaneously; some can be established before others. For example, in many cases of such evolution, internal mechanical equilibrium is established much more rapidly than the other aspects of the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium.<ref name=\"Fitts 43\">Fitts, D.D. (1962), p. 43.</ref> Another example is that, in many cases of such evolution, thermal equilibrium is reached much more rapidly than chemical equilibrium.<ref>Denbigh, K.G. (1951), p. 42.</ref>\n\n===Fluctuations within an isolated system in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium===\n\nIn an isolated system, thermodynamic equilibrium by definition persists over an indefinitely long time. In classical physics it is often convenient to ignore the effects of measurement and this is assumed in the present account.\n\nTo consider the notion of fluctuations in an isolated thermodynamic system, a convenient example is a system specified by its extensive state variables, internal energy, volume, and mass composition. By definition they are time-invariant. By definition, they combine with time-invariant nominal values of their conjugate intensive functions of state, inverse temperature, pressure divided by temperature, and the chemical potentials divided by temperature, so as to exactly obey the laws of thermodynamics.<ref>Tschoegl, N.W. (2000). ''Fundamentals of Equilibrium and Steady-State Thermodynamics'', Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|0-444-50426-5}}, p. 21.</ref> But the laws of thermodynamics, combined with the values of the specifying extensive variables of state, are not sufficient to provide knowledge of those nominal values. Further information is needed, namely, of the constitutive properties of the system.\n\nIt may be admitted that on repeated measurement of those conjugate intensive functions of state, they are found to have slightly different values from time to time. Such variability is regarded as due to internal fluctuations. The different measured values average to their nominal values.\n\nIf the system is truly macroscopic as postulated by classical thermodynamics, then the fluctuations are too small to detect macroscopically. This is called the thermodynamic limit. In effect, the molecular nature of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer have vanished from sight, too small to see. According to Buchdahl: \"... there is no place within the strictly phenomenological theory for the idea of fluctuations about equilibrium (see, however, Section 76).\"<ref>Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 16.</ref>\n\nIf the system is repeatedly subdivided, eventually a system is produced that is small enough to exhibit obvious fluctuations. This is a mesoscopic level of investigation. The fluctuations are then directly dependent on the natures of the various walls of the system. The precise choice of independent state variables is then important. At this stage, statistical features of the laws of thermodynamics become apparent.\n\nIf the mesoscopic system is further repeatedly divided, eventually a  microscopic system is produced. Then the molecular character of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer become important in the processes of fluctuation. One has left the realm of classical or macroscopic thermodynamics, and one needs quantum statistical mechanics. The fluctuations can become relatively dominant, and questions of measurement become important.\n\nThe statement that 'the system is its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium' may be taken to mean that 'indefinitely many such measurements have been taken from time to time, with no trend in time in the various measured values'. Thus the statement, that 'a system is in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, with stated nominal values of its functions of state conjugate to its specifying state variables', is far far more informative than a statement that 'a set of single simultaneous measurements of those functions of state have those same values'. This is because the single measurements might have been made during a slight fluctuation, away from another set of nominal values of those conjugate intensive functions of state, that is due to unknown and different constitutive properties. A single measurement cannot tell whether that might be so, unless there is also knowledge of the nominal values that belong to the equilibrium state.\n\n=== Thermal equilibrium ===\n{{Main|Thermal equilibrium}}\n\nAn explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which there are occurring several irreversible processes, entailing non-zero fluxes; the two systems are separated by a wall permeable only to heat. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then \"it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.\"<ref>Eu, B.C. (2002), page 13.</ref> This illustrates the importance for thermodynamics of the concept of temperature.\n\n[[Thermal equilibrium]] is achieved when two systems in [[thermal contact]] with each other cease to have a net exchange of energy. It follows that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium, then their temperatures are the same.<ref>[[Raj Pathria|R. K. Pathria]], 1996</ref>\n\nThermal equilibrium occurs when a system's [[macroscopic]] thermal observables have ceased to change with time.  For example, an [[ideal gas]] whose [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] has stabilised to a specific [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] would be in thermal equilibrium.  This outcome allows a single [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] to be attributed to the whole system. For an isolated body, it is quite possible for mechanical equilibrium to be reached before thermal equilibrium is reached, but eventually, all aspects of equilibrium, including thermal equilibrium, are necessary for thermodynamic equilibrium.<ref>de Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 44.</ref>\n\n==Non-equilibrium==\n{{Main|Non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}\n\nA system's internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium should be distinguished from a \"stationary state\" in which thermodynamic parameters are unchanging in time but the system is not isolated, so that there are, into and out of the system, non-zero macroscopic fluxes which are constant in time.<ref>de Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 43.</ref>\n\nNon-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.\n\nLaws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are also debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the maximum entropy production principle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ziegler|first1=H.|title=An Introduction to Thermomechanics.|date=1983|location=North Holland, Amsterdam.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=Lars|title=Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes|journal=Phys.

At the 2010 census, its population was 2,950,195 whom 903,871 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of Yuancheng urban District and Dongyuan County largely being urbanized. Zijin County itself is quickly being conurbated in the agglomeration. The majority of the people are [[Hakka people|Hakka]].\nThe city includes many rainforests and the largest lake in Guangdong: [[Xinfengjiang Reservoir]]. The literal meaning of the city's name is \"origin of the river\". It has recently been officially titled as the \"Hometown of the Dinosaur in China\", due to the thousands of dinosaur egg fossils that have been unearthed in its vicinity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Qian|first1=Wang|title=Heyuan, Hometown of the Dinosaur|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2005/Apr/125456.htm|accessdate=5 August 2015|agency=China.org.cn|date=11 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nHeyuan is located in the north-east region of Guangdong, upper reach of [[Dong River (China)|Dong River]] at its confluence with the [[Xingeng River]]. Its latitude spans 23\u00b0 10'\u201324\u00b0 50' N, and longitude 114\u00b0 13'\u2013115\u00b0 35' E. It borders [[Huizhou]] to the south, [[Ganzhou]] ([[Jiangxi]]) to the north, [[Meizhou]] to the east and [[Shaoguan]] to the west. Heyuan is a regional hub that connects the coastal areas of Guangdong and the interior countryside.\n\nHeyuan is rich in natural resources and fertile land. There are {{convert|1000|km2|abbr=on}} of cultivated land, {{convert|13600|km\u00b2|abbr=on}} of hilly land, and {{convert|640|km\u00b2}} of water area. Many mineral deposits such as iron ore, tungsten, tin, fluorite are found in Heyuan.\n\n=== Climate ===\nHeyuan has a monsoon-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''), with short, mild to warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers. Winter begins sunny and dry but becomes progressively wetter and cloudier. Spring is generally overcast and often rainy, while summer continues to be rainy though is much sunnier; there are 9.1 days annually with {{convert|50|mm|2|abbr=on}} of rainfall. Autumn is sunny and dry. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|13.1|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.5|\u00b0C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|21.83|\u00b0C|1}}.

As bike sales increased in the U.S., and after workers at the Schwinn plant in Chicago went on strike in 1980, Giant became a key supplier, making more than two-thirds of Schwinn bikes by the mid-1980s, representing 75% of Giant's sales. When Schwinn decided to find a new source and in 1987 signed a contract with the China Bicycle Company to produce bikes in [[Shenzhen]], Giant, under new president Bill Austin (formerly vice-president marketing at Schwinn), established its own brand of bicycles to compete in the rapidly expanding $200-and-above price range. In 1984, Giant also set up a [[joint venture]], \"Giant Europe,\" with Andries Gaastra of Dutch bicycle manufacturer [[Koga-Miyata]].<ref>[http://www.vakantiefietser.nl/px/pers/gaastra.pdf Interview with Andries Gaastra (Dutch)]</ref> In 1992, Gaastra sold his shares back, and Giant became a full shareholder of Giant Europe.\n\nBy 2018, Giant had sales in over 50 countries, in more than 12,000<ref name=\"Giant\">{{cite web |url=http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/aboutgiant |website=Giant Bicycles.com| title=About Giant}}</ref> retail stores.

The tighter chainstay-seatstay configuration is said to be inherently stiffer than a more conventional frame design, and because less material is used, the Compact Road design is also said to be lighter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/icons-of-cycling-giant-tcr-206346|title=Icons of cycling: Giant TCR - Cycling Weekly|date=2016-01-15|work=Cycling Weekly|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}</ref> With more responsive cornering and improved acceleration, as well as improved aerodynamics, the Giant design became largely imitated.\n\nBy 1998, with [[Mike Burrows]], Giant refined the design for racing by the professional [[ONCE (cycling team)|ONCE team]]. This was only after initial resistance by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] and subsequent amendment to its regulations to allow for bicycles with a sloping top tube.\n\nGiant road frames were originally made of [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061 (ALUXX) aluminium alloy]] and were also characterised by bladed forks and seatposts to reduce air resistance. Frames came in three sizes (small, medium, and large), with riders fitted through the use of stems and seatposts of different lengths. By 2018, Giant road frames were available in up to six sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium, Medium/Large, Large and X-Large).\n\nIn 2003, the TCR frame was offered in carbon fibre construction and marketed as the TCR Composite range. In 2006, Giant added a higher-grade carbon fibre frame marketed as the TCR Advanced frame, which was characterised by an integrated seatpost (ISP). These frames were most notably raced at the Tour de France by T-Mobile's professional team. Using this design, the seatpost on the new frame must be cut precisely to fit the owner by a trained Giant dealer.

As bike sales increased in the U.S., and after workers at the Schwinn plant in Chicago went on strike in 1980, Giant became a key supplier, making more than two-thirds of Schwinn bikes by the mid-1980s, representing 75% of Giant\u2019s sales. When Schwinn decided to find a new source and in 1987 signed a contract with the China Bicycle Company to produce bikes in [[Shenzhen]], Giant, under new president Bill Austin (formerly vice-president marketing at Schwinn), established its own brand of bicycles to compete in the rapidly expanding $200-and-above price range. In 1984, Giant also set up a [[joint venture]], \"Giant Europe,\" with Andries Gaastra of Dutch bicycle manufacturer [[Koga-Miyata]].<ref>[http://www.vakantiefietser.nl/px/pers/gaastra.pdf Interview with Andries Gaastra (Dutch)]</ref> In 1992, Gaastra sold his shares back, and Giant became a full shareholder of Giant Europe.\n\nBy 2018, Giant had sales in over 50 countries, in more than 12,000<ref name=\"Giant\">{{cite web |url=http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/aboutgiant |website=Giant Bicycles.com| title=About Giant}}</ref> retail stores.

The tighter chainstay-seatstay configuration is said to be inherently stiffer than a more conventional frame design, and because less material is used, the Compact Road design is also said to be lighter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/icons-of-cycling-giant-tcr-206346|title=Icons of cycling: Giant TCR - Cycling Weekly|date=2016-01-15|work=Cycling Weekly|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}</ref> With more responsive cornering and improved acceleration, as well as improved aerodynamics, the Giant design became largely imitated.\n\nBy 1998, with [[Mike Burrows]], Giant refined the design for racing by the professional [[ONCE (cycling team)|ONCE team]]. This was only after initial resistance by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] and subsequent amendment to its regulations to allow for bicycles with a sloping top tube.\n\nGiant road frames were originally made of [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061 (ALUXX) aluminium alloy]] and were also characterised by bladed forks and seatposts to reduce air resistance. Frames came in three sizes (small, medium, and large), with riders fitted through the use of stems and seatposts of different lengths. By 2018, Giant road frames were available in up to six sizes (X-Small, Small, Medium, Medium/Large, Large and X-Large).\n\nIn 2003, the TCR frame was offered in carbon fibre construction and marketed as the TCR Composite range. In 2006, Giant added a higher-grade carbon fibre frame marketed as the TCR Advanced frame, which was characterised by an integrated seatpost (ISP). These frames were most notably raced at the Tour de France by T-Mobile's professional team. Using this design, the seatpost on the new frame must be cut precisely to fit the owner by a trained Giant dealer. The TCR Advanced SL frames with ISP continued to be raced internationally, most notably by the Rabobank team (2009-2013), Team Giant-Shimano (2014), Giant-Alpecin (2015\u20132016) and Team Sunweb (2017-2018).\n\nIn terms of other innovations, Giant also introduced its Maestro suspension in 2006.

Then the following are equivalent:{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | pp=403-404}} \n# ''(Z, T)'' is a [[tensor product]] of ''X'' and ''Y'';\n# (a) the image of ''T'' spans all of ''Z'', and (b) ''X'' and ''Y'' are ''T''-linearly disjoint (this means that for all positive integers ''n'' and all elements <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> such that <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{n} T(x_i, y_i) = 0</math>, (i) if all <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> are linearly independent then all <math>y_i</math> are 0, and (ii) if all <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n</math> are linearly independent then all <math>x_i</math> are 0).\n:* Equivalently, ''X'' and ''Y'' are ''T''-linearly disjoint if and only if for all linearly independent sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_m</math> in ''X'' and all linearly independent sequences <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n</math> in ''Y'', the vectors <math>\\left\\{ T(x_i, y_j) : 1 \\leq i \\leq m, 1 \\leq j \\leq n \\right\\}</math> are linearly independent.\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nHenceforth, all topological vector spaces considered will be assumed to be locally convex. \nIf ''Z'' is any locally convex topological vector space, then for any [[equicontinuous]] subsets <math>G \\subseteq X^{\\prime}</math> and <math>H \\subseteq Y^{\\prime}</math>, and any neighborhood <math>N</math> in ''Z'', define \n:<math>\\mathcal{U}(G, H, N) = \\{b \\in \\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{b}, Y^{\\prime}_{b}; Z \\right) : b(G, H) \\subseteq N\\}</math>\nIt can be shown that every set <math>b(G, H)</math> is bounded, which is necessary and sufficient for the collection of all such <math>\\mathcal{U}(G, H, N)</math> to form a locally convex TVS topology on <math>\\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{b}, Y^{\\prime}_{b}; Z \\right)</math> called the '''\u03b5-topology'''.

They were built by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] from 1948 to 1949 for the [[Independent Subway System|IND]]/[[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]] [[B Division (New York City Subway)|B Division]]. A total of 400 cars were built, arranged as single units. Two versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars and General Electric (GE)-powered cars. The R10s introduced many innovations, including  an all-welded low-alloy high tensile (LAHT) steel construction, dynamic braking, improved propulsion, and various cosmetic features.\n\nThe first R10s entered service on November 20, 1948. Various modifications were made over the years to the R10 fleet, and about 110 cars were lightly overhauled in 1984\u20131986. Some R10s were replaced by the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46s]] in the late 1970s; the remaining cars, despite having low reliability rates, outlasted several newer car classes. The remaining R10s were replaced by the [[R68 (New York City Subway car)|R68]]s and [[R68A (New York City Subway car)|R68A]]s, and last ran on October 29, 1989. Two cars have been preserved, while the rest were scrapped.\n\n==Description==\nThe R10s were originally numbered 1803\u20131852 and 3000\u20133349. Cars 1803-1852 were renumbered 2950\u20132999 in 1970. \n\nThe R10s introduced many innovations. For the first time, the car body was of an all-welded low-alloy high tensile (LAHT) steel construction. This gave the body great strength, as the body and underframe were [[welded]] together to form a single, durable and rigid car body which had strong structural integrity. The R10s also featured a new type of braking system known as the \"SMEE\" schedule braking, which introduced [[dynamic braking]]. Dynamic braking reduced wear and tear on brake shoes, reducing maintenance costs. Improved propulsion, in the form of four {{convert|100|hp}} traction motors design instead of the traditional two {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}} motors (the setup used in the [[Arnines]]) improved acceleration from 1.75&nbsp;mph per second to the current 2.5&nbsp;mph/s. They also featured roofline side destination signs, an arrangement that drew criticism. The R10s were also the first subway cars to incorporate roller bearings instead of the standard friction bearings found on all older railway stock, as well as being the last subway cars ordered with air-operated door engines. Additionally, the R10s were the first subway cars to be equipped with air horns, as opposed to air whistles found on all pre-war subway cars. Finally, the cars introduced the [[General Steel Industries]] cast steel truck frame design also used on many passenger cars and coaches up until the R68As in 1989. Sealed beam headlights were installed on all cars of this class starting in 1956.\n\nThese cars were nicknamed '''Thunderbirds''' by their operating personnel and rail fans because of the cars' high speeds.\n\nAlthough the R10s could operate in mixed consists of later SMEE cars, the R10s for the most part ran in solid consists throughout their careers, although they were briefly mixed with R16s in the late 1950s when fifty R16s cars were assigned to the A, and the R42s assigned to the A line during 1969\u20131970.\n\nThe R10s bore several schemes during their service lives. The cars were delivered in two-tone grey/orange stripes. They were then repainted into an aqua blue/white scheme (with or without blue stripe), and finally repainted into the MTA's silver with blue stripe scheme. A handful of cars also carried a tartar red paint scheme for a short time, and the  110 Westinghouse units that went under the GOH program were painted into a green body with a silver roof and black front hood.\n\nThe R10 was the last B-Division car to have to have seats that had thick strand woven cloths covering the entire seat.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-introduction===\nIn 1947, following an accident in 1946,  [[R7/A (New York City Subway car)|R7A]] car 1575 was rebuilt from its original appearance by ACF and became the prototype for the R10. The car was designed to test new interior and cosmetic features. After it was rebuilt, 1575 re-entered service on June 30, 1947; however, while it cosmetically resembled an R10, mechanically and electrically it was still an R7A and could only operate with other pre-war [[Arnines|IND Arnines]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Independent_Fleet_(1932-1939)#Car_Notes| title=The Independent Fleet (1932-1939): Car Notes| website=NYCSubway.org}} {{unreliable source|date=January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/caption.pl?/img/cars/sheet008a-r7a-1575.jpg| title=Passenger Car No. 1575; Contract R7A (Rebuilt as R-10 Sample)| website=NYCSubway.org}}</ref>\n\n===Delivery and revenue service===\nThe R10s first ran in service on the A route on November 20, 1948. They were initially the mainstay, and were exclusively assigned to this train, where they remained for almost 30 years, and became synonymous with that route for more than 20 years.\n\nFifty cars #'s 3300-3349 were transferred to the [[New York City Subway nomenclature#BMT|BMT Eastern Division]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?75642|title=Showing Image 75642|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> in 1954 to help familiarize crews with SMEE equipment in anticipation of the arrival of the R16 cars. Cars 3300-3319 were eventually returned to the IND in 1956 to supply extra A trains for the newly extended IND Fulton Street Line over the existing BMT's Liberty Avenue elevated line to Lefferts Boulevard, along with the newly opened IND Rockaway Line on former LIRR trackage, leaving cars 3320-3349 remaining on the BMT Eastern Division's #15 Jamaica Line until 1961, when new [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27]]s and [[R30 (New York City Subway car)|R30]]s were delivered to the BMT routes, which in turn transferred and returned these cars back to the A.\n\nThen some R10s were finally displaced from the A beginning in 1969 when brand new R42 cars and displaced R40 cars were transferred from Jamaica Yard beginning in early 1978 (which was in turn receiving brand new R46s) were directly assigned to the A (so that the A train could be equipped with some air-conditioned cars). The displaced R10s were then reassigned to the B and rush hours-only CC (now the B and C) to replace aging [[R1 (New York City Subway car)|R1]]s on that line. During 1978-1979 some were also transferred to Jamaica Yard for use on the GG (now the G Brooklyn/Queens Crosstown Local), and also cars 3050\u20133099 to East New York Yard for use on the LL (now the L 14 Street Canarsie Local), in order to fill a car shortage created by the ongoing R46 truck problems.\n\nIn 1975, car 3192 had a new [[R40/A (New York City Subway car)|R40A]]/[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] type front installed; it was a prototype car for a complete rebuilding of the fleet, which would add modern interiors and air-conditioning. The unit was scrapped in 1980 inside Coney Island Yard and the rebuilding program never took place with the other cars because of the higher cost of rebuilding the cars as opposed to purchasing new cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?2485|title=Showing Image 2485|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thejoekorner.com/cars/oddcars.htm#8217| title=NYC Oddball Subway Cars: R-27 Car 8217| website=The JoeKorNer}}</ref>\n\nThere was a light overhaul program for 110 of the WH-powered cars between December 1984 and February 1986 in an effort to get the entire fleet in a non-graffiti state. The rehabilitation of the select R10s was done in-house at a budgeted cost of $65,000 per car.\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:MTA NYC Subway ACF R10 3189.jpg|thumb|left|R10 car 3189 at Pitkin Yard]]\n\nSome R10s were replaced by the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46s]] in the late 1970s. While the remaining cars may have been considered the second worst operating revenue service car during the 1980s based on MDBF (Mean Distance Between Failures), doing better than only the R46s, many R10s outlasted the newer R11s and R16s, as well as a number of R27s and R30s.\n\nThe remaining R10s were replaced by the [[R68 (New York City Subway car)|R68]]s and [[R68A (New York City Subway car)|R68A]]s. The last train of GE-powered R10s and non-overhauled WH-powered R10s ran on November 10, 1988, ten days short of the 40th anniversary of their debut. The rebuilt WH-powered R10s were withdrawn from March 1989 to September 8, 1989, when the last revenue service train ran on the {{NYCS|C}}. On October 29, 1989, a train of R10s (3018-3203-3182-2974-3143-3045-3145-3216) led one final farewell excursion run on various IND-BMT Division routes, including the then-new [[IND 63rd Street Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?127428|title=Showing Image 127428|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?42109|title=Showing Image 42109|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> \n\nAfter retirement, most cars were sent to what is now [[Sims Metal Management]]'s Newark facility to be scrapped and processed. Most R10s were scrapped by June 1990; the last R10 to be taken off property was 3081, the last GE-powered unit in existence. The car was scrapped sometime in 1993.\n\nTwo cars have been preserved:\n* Car '''3184''' has been preserved by the Railway Preservation Corp. and was previously displayed at the [[New York Transit Museum]]. It was repainted into its original two-tone gray and orange striped paint scheme, similar to R7A 1575. The car was restored to operating status in 2017 and has been operating on New York City Transit Museum-sponsored excursions since July 2017, specifically on the ''[[Train of Many Metals]]'' (''TOMM'').\n* Car '''3189''' has been preserved by the New York Transit Museum. The car had an experimental 3-passenger transverse fiberglass interior seating installed in 1969. It was retired from revenue service in 1984, but was later repainted solid blue and used as a Road Car Inspector School Training Car at the TA's [[Pitkin Yard]] in Brooklyn. This car is currently undergoing restoration at the 207th Street Yard.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book| last=Sansone| first=Gene| title=Evolution of New York City subways: An illustrated history of New York City's transit cars, 1867\u20131997| publisher=New York Transit Museum Press| location=New York| year=1997| isbn=978-0-9637492-8-4}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|R10 (New York City Subway car)}}\n*[http://nycsubway.org/cars/r10.html R10 cars at nycsubway.org]\n*[http://www.nycsubway.org/articles/theymovedthemillions5.html ''They Moved Millions'']\n*[http://nycsubway.org/perl/show?2498 Picture of R10 train on LL line during 1979-1984 period]\n\n{{NYCS rolling stock}}\n\n[[Category:Train-related introductions in 1948]]\n[[Category:American Car and Foundry Company]]\n[[Category:New York City Subway rolling stock|R010]]\n[[Category:1948 in rail transport]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox train\n| background = \n| name = R10\n| image = R10 3184.jpg\n| imagealt = \n| imagesize = 250px\n| caption = R10 car 3184 at [[Sheepshead Bay (BMT Brighton Line)|Sheepshead Bay]] on the ''[[Train of Many Metals]]'' in 2018\n| interiorimage = MTA NYC R7A 1575 interior.JPG\n| interiorimagealt = \n| interiorcaption = Interior of R7A car 1575 that was used as the prototype for the R10\n| service = 1948-1989\n| manufacturer = [[American Car & Foundry]]\n| factory = \n| family = \n| replaced = \n| yearconstruction = 1948\u20131949\n| yearservice = 1948\n| refurbishment = 1984\u20131986\n| yearscrapped = 1983\u20131984, 1988\u20131995\n| numberbuilt = 400\n| numberservice = \n| numberpreserved = 2\n| numberscrapped = 398\n| formation = Single units\n| fleetnumbers = ''1948\u20131970:'' 1803\u20131852 and 3000\u20133349<br>''1970\u20131989:'' 2950\u20132974, 3000\u20133049, 3100\u20133224 (WH); 2975\u20132999, 3050\u20133099, 3225\u20133349 (GE)\n| capacity = 56 (seated)\n| operator = [[New York City Board of Transportation|NYC Board of Transportation]]<br>[[New York City Transit Authority]]\n| depots = \n| lines = \n| carbody = [[LAHT Carbon steel]]\n| trainlength = \n| carlength = {{convert|60.3|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|10|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|12.2|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| floorheight = \n| platformheight = {{convert|3.76|ft|2|abbr=on}}\n| entrylevelorstep = \n| doors = 8 sets of 50 inch wide side doors per car\n| art-sections = \n| maxspeed = {{convert|55|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|81200|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n| acceleration = {{convert|2.5|mph/s|km/h/s|abbr=on}}\n| deceleration = \n| traction = '''[[General Electric]] cars''': GE PCM type 17KG116A switch group, with 17KC76A1 master controller, using GE 1240-A3 motors ({{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} each).

They were built by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] from 1948 to 1949 for the [[Independent Subway System|IND]]/[[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]] [[B Division (New York City Subway)|B Division]]. A total of 400 cars were built, arranged as single units. Two versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars and General Electric (GE)-powered cars. The R10s introduced many innovations, including  an all-welded low-alloy high tensile (LAHT) steel construction, dynamic braking, improved propulsion, and various cosmetic features.\n\nThe first R10s entered service on November 20, 1948. Various modifications were made over the years to the R10 fleet, and about 110 cars were lightly overhauled in 1984-1986. Some R10s were replaced by the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46s]] in the late 1970s; the remaining cars, despite having low reliability rates, outlasted several newer car classes. The remaining R10s were replaced by the [[R68 (New York City Subway car)|R68]]s and [[R68A (New York City Subway car)|R68A]]s, and last ran on October 29, 1989. Two cars have been preserved, while the rest were scrapped.\n\n==Description==\nThe R10s were originally numbered 1803\u20131852 and 3000\u20133349. Cars 1803-1852 were renumbered 2950\u20132999 in 1970. \n\nThe R10s introduced many innovations. For the first time, the car body was of an all-welded low-alloy high tensile (LAHT) steel construction. This gave the body great strength, as the body and underframe were [[welded]] together to form a single, durable and rigid car body which had strong structural integrity. The R10s also featured a new type of braking system known as the \"SMEE\" schedule braking, which introduced [[dynamic braking]]. Dynamic braking reduced wear and tear on brake shoes, reducing maintenance costs. Improved propulsion, in the form of four {{convert|100|hp}} traction motors design instead of the traditional two {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}} motors (the setup used in the [[Arnines]]) improved acceleration from 1.75&nbsp;mph per second to the current 2.5&nbsp;mph/s. They also featured roofline side destination signs, an arrangement that drew criticism. The R10s were also the first subway cars to incorporate roller bearings instead of the standard friction bearings found on all older railway stock, as well as being the last subway cars ordered with air-operated door engines. Additionally, the R10s were the first subway cars to be equipped with air horns, as opposed to air whistles found on all pre-war subway cars. Finally, the cars introduced the [[General Steel Industries]] cast steel truck frame design also used on many passenger cars and coaches up until the R68As in 1989. Sealed beam headlights were installed on all cars of this class starting in 1956.\n\nThese cars were nicknamed '''Thunderbirds''' by their operating personnel and rail fans because of the cars' high speeds.\n\nAlthough the R10s could operate in mixed consists of later SMEE cars, the R10s for the most part ran in solid consists throughout their careers, although they were briefly mixed with R16s in the late 1950s when fifty R16s cars were assigned to the A, and the R42s assigned to the A line during 1969-1970.\n\nThe R10s bore several schemes during their service lives. The cars were delivered in two-tone grey/orange stripes. They were then repainted into an aqua blue/white scheme (with or without blue stripe), and finally repainted into the MTA's silver with blue stripe scheme. A handful of cars also carried a tartar red paint scheme for a short time, and the  110 Westinghouse units that went under the GOH program were painted into a green body with a silver roof and black front hood.\n\nThe R10 was the last B-Division car to have to have seats that had thick strand woven cloths covering the entire seat.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-introduction===\nIn 1947, following an accident in 1946,  [[R7/A (New York City Subway car)|R7A]] car 1575 was rebuilt from its original appearance by ACF and became the prototype for the R10. The car was designed to test new interior and cosmetic features. After it was rebuilt, 1575 re-entered service on June 30, 1947; however, while it cosmetically resembled an R10, mechanically and electrically it was still an R7A and could only operate with other pre-war [[Arnines|IND Arnines]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Independent_Fleet_(1932-1939)#Car_Notes| title=The Independent Fleet (1932-1939): Car Notes| website=NYCSubway.org}} {{unreliable source|date=January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/caption.pl?/img/cars/sheet008a-r7a-1575.jpg| title=Passenger Car No. 1575; Contract R7A (Rebuilt as R-10 Sample)| website=NYCSubway.org}}</ref>\n\n===Delivery and revenue service===\nThe R10s first ran in service on the A route on November 20, 1948. They were initially the mainstay, and were exclusively assigned to this train, where they remained for almost 30 years, and became synonymous with that route for more than 20 years.\n\nFifty cars #'s 3300-3349 were transferred to the [[New York City Subway nomenclature#BMT|BMT Eastern Division]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?75642|title=Showing Image 75642|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> in 1954 to help familiarize crews with SMEE equipment in anticipation of the arrival of the R16 cars. Cars 3300-3319 were eventually returned to the IND in 1956 to supply extra A trains for the newly extended IND Fulton Street Line over the existing BMT's Liberty Avenue elevated line to Lefferts Boulevard, along with the newly opened IND Rockaway Line on former LIRR trackage, leaving cars 3320-3349 remaining on the BMT Eastern Division's #15 Jamaica Line until 1961, when new [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27]]s and [[R30 (New York City Subway car)|R30]]s were delivered to the BMT routes, which in turn transferred and returned these cars back to the A.\n\nThen some R10s were finally displaced from the A beginning in 1969 when brand new R42 cars and displaced R40 cars were transferred from Jamaica Yard beginning in early 1978 (which was in turn receiving brand new R46s) were directly assigned to the A (so that the A train could be equipped with some air-conditioned cars). The displaced R10s were then reassigned to the B and rush hours-only CC (now the B and C) to replace aging [[R1 (New York City Subway car)|R1]]s on that line. During 1978-1979 some were also transferred to Jamaica Yard for use on the GG (now the G Brooklyn/Queens Crosstown Local), and also cars 3050-3099 to East New York Yard for use on the LL (now the L 14 Street Canarsie Local), in order to fill a car shortage created by the ongoing R46 truck problems.\n\nIn 1975, car 3192 had a new [[R40/A (New York City Subway car)|R40A]]/[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42]] type front installed; it was a prototype car for a complete rebuilding of the fleet, which would add modern interiors and air-conditioning. The unit was scrapped in 1980 inside Coney Island Yard and the rebuilding program never took place with the other cars because of the higher cost of rebuilding the cars as opposed to purchasing new cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?2485|title=Showing Image 2485|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thejoekorner.com/cars/oddcars.htm#8217| title=NYC Oddball Subway Cars: R-27 Car 8217| website=The JoeKorNer}}</ref>\n\nThere was a light overhaul program for 110 of the WH-powered cars between December 1984 and February 1986 in an effort to get the entire fleet in a non-graffiti state. The rehabilitation of the select R10s was done in-house at a budgeted cost of $65,000 per car.\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:MTA NYC Subway ACF R10 3189.jpg|thumb|left|R10 car 3189 at Pitkin Yard]]\n\nSome R10s were replaced by the [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46s]] in the late 1970s. While the remaining cars may have been considered the second worst operating revenue service car during the 1980s based on MDBF (Mean Distance Between Failures), doing better than only the R46s, many R10s outlasted the newer R11s and R16s, as well as a number of R27s and R30s.\n\nThe remaining R10s were replaced by the [[R68 (New York City Subway car)|R68]]s and [[R68A (New York City Subway car)|R68A]]s. The last train of GE-powered R10s and non-overhauled WH-powered R10s ran on November 10, 1988, ten days short of the 40th anniversary of their debut. The rebuilt WH-powered R10s were withdrawn from March 1989 to September 8, 1989, when the last revenue service train ran on the {{NYCS|C}}. On October 29, 1989, a train of R10s (3018-3203-3182-2974-3143-3045-3145-3216) led one final farewell excursion run on various IND-BMT Division routes, including the then-new [[IND 63rd Street Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?127428|title=Showing Image 127428|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?42109|title=Showing Image 42109|work=nycsubway.org}}</ref> \n\nAfter retirement, most cars were sent to what is now [[Sims Metal Management]]'s Newark facility to be scrapped and processed.

It lay there for 14 years until 1988, when it was sold, dismantled, refurbished and shipped to Turkey where it was used to drive the Moda tunnel for the Istanbul Sewerage Scheme, designed and supervised by British Civil Engineers Binnie & Partners, and officially opened by Margaret Thatcher in 1989.\n\n=== Initiation of project ===\n{{see also|Premiership of Margaret Thatcher#Channel Tunnel}}\nIn 1979, the \"Mouse-hole Project\" was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not object to a privately funded project, although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains. In 1981, Thatcher and the French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:\n\n* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M).\n* Eurobridge, a {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} [[suspension bridge]] with a series of {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} spans with a roadway in an enclosed tube.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zhjOPdmyz1wC&lpg=PA17&pg=PA18#v=onepage |title=''New Scientist'' on Google Books |access-date=12 October 2019|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business |date=2 May 1985 }}</ref>\n* Euroroute, a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.\n* Channel Expressway, a large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name \"Flexilink\". In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but concerns about ventilation, accident management and driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\">Wilson pp. 14\u201321</ref> Reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel, least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}}\n\n=== Arrangement ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel project relations flow chart 1.svg|thumb|A block diagram describing the organisation structure used on the project. Eurotunnel is the central organisation for construction and operation (via a concession) of the tunnel]]\n\nThe British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France\u2013Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was done by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was done by the five British construction companies in the ''Translink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by a bi-national project organisation called [[TransManche Link]] (TML).<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> The ''Ma\u00eetre d'Oeuvre'' was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.10\u201311\">Kirkland pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project had widespread approval. The French National Assembly approved it unanimously in April 1987, and after a public inquiry, the Senate approved it unanimously in June. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and passed by 94&nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into law in July.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162022/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 96/97\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&nbsp;96\u201397</ref> TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993){{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}} to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and [[SNCF]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.\n\nPrivate funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale.

Also visible is the segmented tunnel lining]]\n\nSurveying undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk [[marl]] stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.\n\nBetween the portals at Beussingue and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] the tunnel is {{convert|50.5|km|mi|0}} long, with {{convert|3.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the French side and {{convert|9.3|km|mi|0}} on the UK side, and {{convert|37.9|km|mi|0}} under sea.<ref name=\"ICE p. 95\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95{{inconsistent|reason=The book has only 65 pages: please verify the source.}}</ref> It is the third-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] in Switzerland and the [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.<ref name=\"Daily Post 2006\">{{cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = 'Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 }}</ref> The average depth is {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below the seabed.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.13\">Kirkland p. 13</ref> On the UK side, of the expected {{convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on}} of spoil approximately {{convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd}} was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] {{convert|74|acre|ha|0}}<ref name=\"Anderson Story p xvi-xvii\"/> of land.<ref name=\"ICE p. 208\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208</ref> This land was then made into the [[Samphire Hoe Country Park]].

However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 51\">Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel geological profile 1.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Geological profile along the tunnel as constructed. For most of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk [[marl]] stratum (layer)]]\n\nSuccessful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:\n\n* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1605.\n* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90\u2013100&nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay.\n* A {{convert|25|\u2013|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30\u201340% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.<ref name=\"Eng Geol\">{{cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0-7277-2045-7 | page = 57 |display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nOn the English side, the stratum [[Strike and dip|dip]] is less than 5\u00b0; on the French side this increases to 20\u00b0. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist; on the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/>\n\nThe Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964\u201365 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage [[adit]]s.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/> The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\">Kirkland pp. 21\u201350</ref>\n\n=== Surveying ===\nMarine soundings and samplings by Thom\u00e9 de Gamond were carried out during 1833\u201367, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&nbsp;marine and 70&nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/> Surveys were undertaken in 1958\u20131959, 1964\u20131965, 1972\u20131974 and 1986\u20131988.\n\nThe surveying in 1958\u201359 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964\u201365 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/>\n\nGiven the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972\u201373 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986\u201387 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\">Kirkland pp. 22\u201326</ref>\n\n=== Tunnelling ===\n[[File:Eurotunnel schema (empty service).svg|thumb|Typical cross section, with the service tunnel between the two rail tunnels; shown linking the rail tunnels is a piston relief duct, necessary to manage changes in air pressure caused by the very fast movement of trains]]\n\nTunnelling was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, which opened in 1988. A serious health and safety risk with building tunnels underwater is major water inflow due to the high [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.\n\nThe objective was to construct two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}}  service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} in diameter connecting the rail tunnels {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 63\u2013128</ref> with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in [[Seattle]]; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.\n\nPrecast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key.<ref name=\"Wilson p.38\">Wilson p. 38</ref> On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff \u2013 same place as the marine tunnels \u2013 not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the [[Isle of Grain]] in the Thames estuary,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the [[Foster Yeoman]] coastal super quarry at [[Glensanda]] in [[Loch Linnhe]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nOn the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance [[Tunnel boring machine|TBMs]] with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.29\">Kirkland p. 29</ref> Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.<ref name=\"Wilson p. 44\">Wilson p. 44</ref> A {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.117\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 117\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the English machines, which were given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, S\u00e9verine.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | first = Pierre-Jean | last = Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher = pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326113849/http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | archive-date = 26 March 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the tunnelling, one machine was on display at the side of the M20 motorway in [[Folkestone]] until [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] sold it on eBay for \u00a339,999 to a scrap metal merchant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotunnel.com/build/ |title=How the Channel Tunnel was Built |publisher=Eurotunnel Le Shuttle |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Another machine (T4 \"Virginie\") still survives on the French side, adjacent to Junction 41 on the [[A16 autoroute|A16]], in the middle of the D243E3/D243E4 roundabout.

The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100&nbsp;kg support the rails every 60&nbsp;cm and are held by 12&nbsp;mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.<ref name=\"bonnett782\">Bonnett 2005, p. 78</ref> The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60&nbsp;kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on {{convert|6|mm|1|abbr=on}} rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.\n\nMaintenance activities are less than projected. Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built; 150 m long, 10 m high and 18 m wide. The English crossover is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from Sangatte.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=14}}\n\n==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====\nThe ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=8}}\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:TGV TMST 3011-2 - Sortie Tunnel sous la Manche \u00e0 Coquelles - Florian F\u00e8vre.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the tunnel near Coquelles, France]]\n\n==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}\n\nInitially 38&nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train.

By mid-1989 the price had risen to \u00a311.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during demonstration runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.josephcoates.com/pdf_files/268_Megaprojects_and_Risk.pdf | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | publisher=josephcoates.com | accessdate =19 July 2009 }}</ref> In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34&nbsp;years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 32\u201334\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 32\u201334</ref> A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have been better off if it had not been constructed.<ref name=\"Anguera 2006\"/><ref name=\"Flyvbjerg\">{{cite book |author1=Flyvbjerg, B.

There are [[juxtaposed controls]], meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are placed only at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]], while British officials operate at [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]], [[Lille-Europe]], [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] and [[Gare du Nord|Paris-Gare du Nord]].  There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.\n\nFor Eurostar trains travelling from places south of Paris, there is no passport and security check before departure, and those trains must stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are done on board. There have been plans for services from [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille. A direct service from London to Amsterdam started on 4 April 2018; following the building of check-in terminals at Amsterdam and Rotterdam and intergovernmental agreement, a direct service from the two Dutch cities to London will start on 30 April 2020.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe reason for juxtaposed controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because a check of all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates long queues if done at arrival.\n\n===No-deal Brexit plan===\n\nUnder a planned legislation which was published on 12 February 2019, it will give the UK and France time to renegotiate the terms under which the railway service operates. Trains will be permitted to use the Channel Tunnel for three months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under a proposed [[European Commission]] law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47215904|title=Brexit: No-deal plan for Channel Tunnel operations|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Terminals ==\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Calais Terminal|Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal}}\n\n[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|Car being driven onto a shuttle carriage at the French terminal in [[Coquelles]]]]\n\nThe terminals' sites are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and [[Coquelles]] (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&nbsp;cars and 113&nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]] for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging.\n\nThe French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.255\u2013270\">Kirkland pp. 255\u2013270</ref> At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of main-line track, 45&nbsp;turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track and 44&nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.157\u2013174\">Kirkland pp. 157\u2013174</ref> There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].\n\n== Regional impact ==\nA 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 220-222\">European Commission pp. 220\u2013222</ref> Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of [[Ashford International railway station]], without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 248-252\">European Commission pp. 248\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'. Tunnel-induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth.<ref name=\"Fayman\">{{cite journal | last = Fayman | first = Sonia |author2=Metge, Pierre |date=September 1995 | title = The regional impact of the Channel Tunnel: Qualitative and quantitative analysis |journal=European Planning Studies | volume = 3 |issue= 3 | page = 333 | doi = 10.1080/09654319508720310 }}</ref> The South East of England is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental Europe, but the benefits are unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region.

The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. \"Pods\" with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|tonne}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to {{convert|1|tonne}} can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.247\u2013254\">Kirkland pp. 247\u2013254</ref>\n\nThe three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\"/>\n\nTrains travelling at high speed create [[piston effect]] pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\">Kirkland pp. 212\u2013230</ref> Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.<ref name=\"CT experience\">The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19\u201323</ref>\n\nThe safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station \u2013 now part of the [[Building Research Establishment]] \u2013 to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.231\u2013240\">Kirkland pp. 231\u2013240</ref> The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or [[ultraviolet radiation]], smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |work=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane}}</ref> The ventilation system can control smoke movement.

In 1958 the 1881 workings were cleared in preparation for a \u00a3100,000 geological survey by the Channel Tunnel Study Group. 30% of the funding came from the Channel Tunnel Co Ltd, the largest shareholder of which was the [[British Transport Commission]], as successor to the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]].<ref>''Railway Magazine'' November 1958 p. 805</ref> A detailed geological survey was carried out in 1964 and 1965.<ref name=\"halcrow-film-1964\u201365\">{{cite web |title=Channel Tunnel Site Investigation \u2013 1964 |publisher=Halcrow Group |date=13 July 2011 |url=http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/ |accessdate=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001065054/http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/ |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}  Online presentation of a 1964\u201365 film documentary of a geological survey of the Channel, with a brief summary.</ref>\n\nAlthough the two countries agreed to build a tunnel in 1964, the phase 1 initial studies and signing of a second agreement to cover phase 2 took until 1973.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title = Illustrated London News|year = 1975}}</ref>  Construction work of this government-funded project to create two tunnels designed to accommodate car shuttle wagons on either side of a service tunnel started on both sides of the Channel in 1974.\n\nOn 20 January 1975, to the dismay of their French partners, the now-governing Labour Party in Britain cancelled the project due to uncertainty about [[European Economic Community|EEC]] membership, doubling cost estimates and the general economic crisis at the time.  By this time the British tunnel boring machine was ready and the Ministry of Transport was able to do a {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} experimental drive.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\" /> This short tunnel was reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the British side.

It lay there for 14 years until 1988, when it was sold, dismantled, refurbished and shipped to Turkey where it was used to drive the Moda tunnel for the Istanbul Sewerage Scheme, designed and supervised by British Civil Engineers Binnie & Partners, and officially opened by Margaret Thatcher in 1989.\n\n=== Initiation of project ===\n{{see also|Premiership of Margaret Thatcher#Channel Tunnel}}\nIn 1979, the \"Mouse-hole Project\" was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not object to a privately funded project, although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains. In 1981, Thatcher and the French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:\n\n* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M).\n* Eurobridge, a {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} [[suspension bridge]] with a series of {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} spans with a roadway in an enclosed tube.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zhjOPdmyz1wC&lpg=PA17&pg=PA18#v=onepage |title=''New Scientist'' on Google Books |access-date=12 October 2019|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business |date=2 May 1985 }}</ref>\n* Euroroute, a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.\n* Channel Expressway, a large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name \"Flexilink\". In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but concerns about ventilation, accident management and driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\">Wilson pp. 14\u201321</ref> Reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel, least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}}\n\n=== Arrangement ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel project relations flow chart 1.svg|thumb|A block diagram describing the organisation structure used on the project. Eurotunnel is the central organisation for construction and operation (via a concession) of the tunnel]]\n\nThe British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France\u2013Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was done by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was done by the five British construction companies in the ''Translink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by a bi-national project organisation called [[TransManche Link]] (TML).<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> The ''Ma\u00eetre d'Oeuvre'' was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.10\u201311\">Kirkland pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project had widespread approval. The French National Assembly approved it unanimously in April 1987, and after a public inquiry, the Senate approved it unanimously in June. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and passed by 94&nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into law in July.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162022/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 96/97\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&nbsp;96\u201397</ref> TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993){{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}} to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and [[SNCF]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.\n\nPrivate funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale.

The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS).

For most of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk [[marl]] stratum (layer)]]\n\nSuccessful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:\n\n* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1605.\n* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90\u2013100&nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay.\n* A {{convert|25|\u2013|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30\u201340% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.<ref name=\"Eng Geol\">{{cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0-7277-2045-7 | page = 57 |display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nOn the English side, the stratum [[Strike and dip|dip]] is less than 5\u00b0; on the French side this increases to 20\u00b0. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist; on the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/>\n\nThe Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964\u201365 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage [[adit]]s.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/> The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\">Kirkland pp. 21\u201350</ref>\n\n=== Surveying ===\nMarine soundings and samplings by Thom\u00e9 de Gamond were carried out during 1833\u201367, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&nbsp;marine and 70&nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/> Surveys were undertaken in 1958\u20131959, 1964\u20131965, 1972\u20131974 and 1986\u20131988.\n\nThe surveying in 1958\u201359 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964\u201365 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/>\n\nGiven the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972\u201373 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986\u201387 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\">Kirkland pp. 22\u201326</ref>\n\n=== Tunnelling ===\n[[File:Eurotunnel schema (empty service).svg|thumb|Typical cross section, with the service tunnel between the two rail tunnels; shown linking the rail tunnels is a piston relief duct, necessary to manage changes in air pressure caused by the very fast movement of trains]]\n\nTunnelling was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, which opened in 1988. A serious health and safety risk with building tunnels underwater is major water inflow due to the high [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.\n\nThe objective was to construct two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}}  service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} in diameter connecting the rail tunnels {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 63\u2013128</ref> with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in [[Seattle]]; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.\n\nPrecast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key.<ref name=\"Wilson p.38\">Wilson p. 38</ref> On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff \u2013 same place as the marine tunnels \u2013 not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the [[Isle of Grain]] in the Thames estuary,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the [[Foster Yeoman]] coastal super quarry at [[Glensanda]] in [[Loch Linnhe]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nOn the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance [[Tunnel boring machine|TBMs]] with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.29\">Kirkland p. 29</ref> Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.<ref name=\"Wilson p. 44\">Wilson p. 44</ref> A {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.117\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 117\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the English machines, which were given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, S\u00e9verine.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | first = Pierre-Jean | last = Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher = pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326113849/http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | archive-date = 26 March 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the tunnelling, one machine was on display at the side of the M20 motorway in [[Folkestone]] until [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] sold it on eBay for \u00a339,999 to a scrap metal merchant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotunnel.com/build/ |title=How the Channel Tunnel was Built |publisher=Eurotunnel Le Shuttle |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Another machine (T4 \"Virginie\") still survives on the French side, adjacent to Junction 41 on the [[A16 autoroute|A16]], in the middle of the D243E3/D243E4 roundabout.

The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100&nbsp;kg support the rails every 60&nbsp;cm and are held by 12&nbsp;mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.<ref name=\"bonnett782\">Bonnett 2005, p. 78</ref> The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60&nbsp;kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on {{convert|6|mm|1|abbr=on}} rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.\n\nMaintenance activities are less than projected. Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built; 150 m long, 10 m high and 18 m wide. The English crossover is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from Sangatte.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=14}}\n\n==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====\nThe ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=8}}\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:TGV TMST 3011-2 - Sortie Tunnel sous la Manche \u00e0 Coquelles - Florian F\u00e8vre.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the tunnel near Coquelles, France]]\n\n==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}\n\nInitially 38&nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train.

There are [[juxtaposed controls]], meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are placed only at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]], while British officials operate at [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]], [[Lille-Europe]], [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] and [[Gare du Nord|Paris-Gare du Nord]].  There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.\n\nFor Eurostar trains travelling from places south of Paris, there is no passport and security check before departure, and those trains must stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are done on board. There have been plans for services from [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille. A direct service from London to Amsterdam started on 4 April 2018; following the building of check-in terminals at Amsterdam and Rotterdam and intergovernmental agreement, a direct service from the two Dutch cities to London will start on 30 April 2020.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe reason for juxtaposed controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because a check of all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates long queues if done at arrival.\n\n===No-deal Brexit plan===\n\nUnder a planned legislation which was published on 12 February 2019, it will give the UK and France time to renegotiate the terms under which the railway service operates. Trains will be permitted to use the Channel Tunnel for three months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under a proposed [[European Commission]] law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47215904|title=Brexit: No-deal plan for Channel Tunnel operations|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Terminals ==\n{{Main|Eurotunnel Calais Terminal|Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal}}\n\n[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|Car being driven onto a shuttle carriage at the French terminal in [[Coquelles]]]]\n\nThe terminals' sites are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and [[Coquelles]] (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&nbsp;cars and 113&nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]] for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging.\n\nThe French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.255\u2013270\">Kirkland pp. 255\u2013270</ref> At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of main-line track, 45&nbsp;turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track and 44&nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.157\u2013174\">Kirkland pp. 157\u2013174</ref> There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].\n\n== Regional impact ==\nA 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 220-222\">European Commission pp. 220\u2013222</ref> Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of [[Ashford International railway station]], without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 248-252\">European Commission pp. 248\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'.

The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. \"Pods\" with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|tonne}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to {{convert|1|tonne}} can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.247\u2013254\">Kirkland pp. 247\u2013254</ref>\n\nThe three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\"/>\n\nTrains travelling at high speed create [[piston effect]] pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\">Kirkland pp. 212\u2013230</ref> Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.<ref name=\"CT experience\">The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19\u201323</ref>\n\nThe safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station \u2013 now part of the [[Building Research Establishment]] \u2013 to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.231\u2013240\">Kirkland pp. 231\u2013240</ref> The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or [[ultraviolet radiation]], smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |work=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane}}</ref> The ventilation system can control smoke movement.
