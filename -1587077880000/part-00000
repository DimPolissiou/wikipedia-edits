Using the authentic script taken from the only surviving transcript recorded during the meeting, the film delves into the [[psychology]] of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] officials involved in the \"[[Final Solution]] of the Jewish Question\" during [[World War II]].\n\nThe movie was written by [[Loring Mandel]], directed by [[Frank Pierson]], and starred an ensemble cast, including [[Colin Firth]], [[David Threlfall]], [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Adolf Eichmann]]. Branagh won an [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actor, and Tucci was awarded a [[Golden Globe]] for his supporting role as Eichmann.\n\n==Plot==\nOn January 20, 1942, as [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany's]] war effort sours due to the failure of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the entrance of the [[United States]] into [[World War II]], and the death of [[Walther von Reichenau]], a [[Wannsee Conference|meeting]] is held to determine the method by which the government is to implement [[Adolf Hitler]]'s policy, that the [[German-occupied Europe|German sphere of influence]] should be [[Judenfrei|free of Jews]], including those in the occupied territories of [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Poland]], [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Latvia, Estonia,]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|France]]. As the film opens, various officials from different German agencies arrive and mingle at a lakeside [[villa]] in the [[Berlin]] [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|borough]] of [[Wannsee]]. Among those present:\n\n*[[Wilhelm Stuckart]] ([[Colin Firth]]), a lawyer representing the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Ministry]] and co-author of the [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Nuremberg Laws]]\n*[[Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger]] ([[David Threlfall]]), deputy head of the [[Reich Chancellery]]\n*[[Gerhard Klopfer]] ([[Ian McNeice]]), a [[Falstaff|Falstaffian]] lawyer from the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]]\n*[[Otto Hofmann]] ([[Nicholas Woodeson]]), Chief of the [[RuSHA|SS Race and Settlement Main Office]]\n*[[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]] ([[Kevin McNally]]), the obsequious [[Foreign Ministry]]'s liaison to the [[SS]].\n*[[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] ([[Brendan Coyle]]), [[Gestapo]] chief and [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s immediate superior\n*[[Josef B\u00fchler]] ([[Ben Daniels]]), State Secretary for the [[General Government]] of occupied [[Poland]] \n*[[Rudolf Lange]] ([[Barnaby Kay]]), a [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) Commander \n*[[Alfred Meyer]] ([[Brian Pettifer]]), Deputy Reich Minister, Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories\n*[[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]] ([[Jonathan Coy]]), the apparently out-ranked Director of the Office of the [[Four Year Plan]]\n*[[Reinhard Heydrich]] ([[Kenneth Branagh]]), [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s right-hand man in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], who begins by explaining the purpose of the meeting. \n\nIt is quickly established by those present that there is a significant \"[[Jewish question|Jewish problem]]\", in that the Jews of Europe cannot be efficiently contained, nor can they be forced onto other countries. Kritzinger interrupts at several points to opine that the meeting is pointless, given that the [[Jewish Question]] had previously been settled, but Heydrich promises to revisit his concerns. Heydrich announces that the government's policy will change from emigration from German-held territories to \"evacuation\" to the Occupied Eastern Territories, and that [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] will be forced to cooperate. As the squalor at the camps and ghettos for Jews, including [[Theresienstadt Ghetto|Theresienstadt,]] becomes apparent to the attendees, there is consternation over the use of [[Euphemism|euphemisms]] from the SS members, including Meyer, who want to adopt an open policy of [[genocide]].\n\nA discussion follows of the possibilities of [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]], and of the exemptions for [[Mischling|mixed race Jews]] who have one or more non-Jewish grandparents. At this point, Stuckart loses his temper and insists that a sturdy legal framework is paramount, and that ''[[ad hoc]]'' application of standards will lead to administrative chaos. He also chides Klopfer for his simplistic portrayal of Jews as subhuman beasts, simultaneously painting his own picture of Jews as clever, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and untrustworthy. \n\nHeydrich calls a break in the proceedings, and after praising Stuckart aloud takes him aside to warn him about the consequences of his stubbornness, implying that others in the SS will take an unwanted interest in his actions. When the meeting reconvenes, Heydrich steers the discussion in the direction of [[Genocide|wholesale extermination]] using [[gas chamber]]s. This causes consternation among some attendees, notably Kritzinger, who objects on the grounds that Hitler had given him personal guarantees that extermination of the Jews was not being considered, and B\u00fchler who is shocked to discover that the SS have been building [[extermination camps]] at [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and making preparations for the \"[[The Holocaust|Final Solution]]\" under his nose.\n\nIt eventually becomes clear to everyone at the meeting that they have been called together not to discuss the problem but to be given orders by the SS, who are intent on wresting control of the operation from other agencies such as the Interior Ministry and the Reich Chancellery. Eichmann now describes the method that will be used, i.e. the gassing of Jews. Many have already been killed in [[Nazi gas van|specially designed trucks]] and his figures include tens of thousands of victims. Eichmann explains that permanent [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]] will be built at locations such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He even describes their bodies as coming out \"pink\" (a symptom of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]), at which point Hofmann is suddenly taken ill. He later puts it down to a bad cigar.\n\nThroughout the meeting and over refreshments attendees raise other side issues, reflecting the interests of their respective work areas.  Lange warns executing Jews by shooting has a deleterious effect on the morale of his troops, and he clashes with Luther's indifference. Klopfer requests that the Party retains some discretionary power over the process. B\u00fchler presses for urgency, concerned that [[typhus]] could break out from the over-populated ghettos in Poland.  Meyer and Neumann do not want production stymied due to disruption or the loss of skilled workers.  Heydrich admonishes Hofmann over his insistence that his office takes the lead in managing resettlement in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]].\n\nA break is called and this time it is Kritzinger's turn to be taken aside and intimidated by Heydrich, who warns that Kritzinger is influential but not invulnerable. Heydrich tells Kritzinger that he wants not only consent but active support, and Kritzinger realizes that any hopes he had of assuring livable conditions for the Jewish population are unrealistic. In return, he tells Heydrich a [[cautionary tale]] about a man consumed by hatred of his father, so much so that his life loses its meaning once his father dies; Heydrich later interprets this as a warning that a similar fate awaits them if they allow their lives to revolve around antisemitism.\n\nHeydrich then recalls and concludes the meeting, giving clear directives that the SS are to be obeyed in all matters relating to the elimination of the Jews. He also asks for explicit assent and support from each official, one by one. After giving careful instructions on the secrecy of the minutes and notes of the meeting, they are adjourned and begin to depart.\n\nAs the servants at the [[villa]] tidy away the remains of the meeting, and the officials depart, a brief account of the fate of each one is given. Most of the members either died during the war or were acquitted by Allied military tribunals to live a peaceful life in postwar [[West Germany]]. Heydrich would be assassinated by [[Resistance in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovak partisans]] for his brutal rule in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Bohemia and Moravia]] within several weeks, while Eichmann would flee to [[Buenos Aires]] but be captured and sentenced to death by [[Israel]] in the 1960s. The movie ends with the house tidied up and all records of the meeting destroyed as if it had never happened. The final card before the credits reveals that Luther's copy of the Wannsee minutes, recovered by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in the archives of the [[Federal Foreign Office|German Foreign

Using the authentic script taken from the only surviving transcript recorded during the meeting,the film delves into the [[psychology]] of [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] officials involved in the \"[[Final Solution]] of the Jewish Question\" during [[World War II]].\n\nThe movie was written by [[Loring Mandel]], directed by [[Frank Pierson]], and starred an ensemble cast, including [[Colin Firth]], [[David Threlfall]], [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[Adolf Eichmann]]. Branagh won an [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actor, and Tucci was awarded a [[Golden Globe]] for his supporting role as Eichmann.\n\n==Plot==\nOn January 20, 1942, as [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany's]] war effort sours due to the failure of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the entrance of the [[United States]] into [[World War II]], and the death of [[Walther von Reichenau]], a [[Wannsee Conference|meeting]] is held to determine the method by which the government is to implement [[Adolf Hitler]]'s policy, that the [[German-occupied Europe|German sphere of influence]] should be [[Judenfrei|free of Jews]], including those in the occupied territories of [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Poland]], [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Latvia, Estonia,]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|France]]. As the film opens, various officials from different German agencies arrive and mingle at a lakeside [[villa]] in the [[Berlin]] [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|borough]] of [[Wannsee]]. Among those present:\n\n*[[Wilhelm Stuckart]] ([[Colin Firth]]), a lawyer representing the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Ministry]] and co-author of the [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Nuremberg Laws]]\n*[[Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger]] ([[David Threlfall]]), deputy head of the [[Reich Chancellery]]\n*[[Gerhard Klopfer]] ([[Ian McNeice]]), a [[Falstaff|Falstaffian]] lawyer from the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]]\n*[[Otto Hofmann]] ([[Nicholas Woodeson]]), Chief of the [[RuSHA|SS Race and Settlement Main Office]]\n*[[Martin Luther (diplomat)|Martin Luther]] ([[Kevin McNally]]), the obsequious [[Foreign Ministry]]'s liaison to the [[SS]].\n*[[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] ([[Brendan Coyle]]), [[Gestapo]] chief and [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s immediate superior\n*[[Josef B\u00fchler]] ([[Ben Daniels]]), State Secretary for the [[General Government]] of occupied [[Poland]] \n*[[Rudolf Lange]] ([[Barnaby Kay]]), a [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) Commander \n*[[Alfred Meyer]] ([[Brian Pettifer]]), Deputy Reich Minister, Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories\n*[[Erich Neumann (politician)|Erich Neumann]] ([[Jonathan Coy]]), the apparently out-ranked Director of the Office of the [[Four Year Plan]]\n*[[Reinhard Heydrich]] ([[Kenneth Branagh]]), [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s right-hand man in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], who begins by explaining the purpose of the meeting. \n\nIt is quickly established by those present that there is a significant \"[[Jewish question|Jewish problem]]\", in that the Jews of Europe cannot be efficiently contained, nor can they be forced onto other countries. Kritzinger interrupts at several points to opine that the meeting is pointless, given that the [[Jewish Question]] had previously been settled, but Heydrich promises to revisit his concerns. Heydrich announces that the government's policy will change from emigration from German-held territories to \"evacuation\" to the Occupied Eastern Territories, and that [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] will be forced to cooperate. As the squalor at the camps and ghettos for Jews, including [[Theresienstadt Ghetto|Theresienstadt,]] become apparent to the attendees, there is consternation over the use of [[Euphemism|euphemisms]] from the SS members, including Meyer, who want to adopt an open policy of [[genocide]].\n\nA discussion follows of the possibilities of [[Compulsory sterilization|sterilization]], and of the exemptions for [[Mischling|mixed race Jews]] who have one or more non-Jewish grandparents. At this point, Stuckart loses his temper and insists that a sturdy legal framework is paramount, and that ''[[ad hoc]]'' application of standards will lead to administrative chaos. He also chides Klopfer for his simplistic portrayal of Jews as subhuman beasts, simultaneously painting his own picture of Jews as clever, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], and untrustworthy. \n\nHeydrich calls a break in the proceedings, and after praising Stuckart aloud takes him aside to warn him about the consequences of his stubbornness, implying that others in the SS will take an unwanted interest in his actions. When the meeting reconvenes, Heydrich steers the discussion in the direction of [[Genocide|wholesale extermination]] using [[gas chamber]]s. This causes consternation among some attendees, notably Kritzinger, who objects on the grounds that Hitler had given him personal guarantees that extermination of the Jews was not being considered, and B\u00fchler who is shocked to discover that the SS have been building [[extermination camps]] at [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and making preparations for the \"[[The Holocaust|Final Solution]]\" under his nose.\n\nIt eventually becomes clear to everyone at the meeting that they have been called together not to discuss the problem but to be given orders by the SS, who are intent on wresting control of the operation from other agencies such as the Interior Ministry and the Reich Chancellery. Eichmann now describes the method that will be used, i.e. the gassing of Jews. Many have already been killed in [[Nazi gas van|specially-designed trucks]] and his figures include tens of thousands of victims. Eichmann explains that permanent [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]] will be built at locations such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. He even describes their bodies as coming out \"pink\" (a symptom of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]), at which point Hofmann is suddenly taken ill. He later puts it down to a bad cigar.\n\nThroughout the meeting and over refreshments attendees raise other side issues, reflecting the interests of their respective work areas.  Lange warns executing Jews by shooting has a deleterious effect on the morale of his troops, and he clashes with Luther's indifference. Klopfer requests that the Party retains some discretionary power over the process. B\u00fchler presses for urgency, concerned that [[typhus]] could break out from the over-populated ghettos in Poland.  Meyer and Neumann do not want production stymied due to disruption or the loss of skilled workers.  Heydrich admonishes Hofmann over his insistence that his office takes the lead in managing resettlement in [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]].\n\nA break is called and this time it is Kritzinger's turn to be taken aside and intimidated by Heydrich, who warns that Kritzinger is influential but not invulnerable. Heydrich tells Kritzinger that he wants not only consent but active support, and Kritzinger realizes that any hopes he had of assuring livable conditions for the Jewish population are unrealistic. In return, he tells Heydrich a [[cautionary tale]] about a man consumed by hatred of his father, so much so that his life loses its meaning once his father dies; Heydrich later interprets this as a warning that a similar fate awaits them if they allow their lives to revolve around antisemitism.\n\nHeydrich then recalls and concludes the meeting, giving clear directives that the SS are to be obeyed in all matters relating to the elimination of the Jews. He also asks for explicit assent and support from each official, one by one. After giving careful instructions on the secrecy of the minutes and notes of the meeting, they are adjourned and begin to depart.\n\nAs the servants at the [[villa]] tidy away the remains of the meeting, and the officials depart, a brief account of the fate of each one is given. Most of the members either died during the war or were acquitted by Allied military tribunals to live a peaceful life in postwar [[West Germany]]. Heydrich would be assassinated by [[Resistance in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czechoslovak partisans]] for his brutal rule in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Bohemia and Moravia]] within several weeks, while Eichmann would flee to [[Buenos Aires]] but be captured and sentenced to death by [[Israel]] in the 1960s.

It forecasts the [[societal collapse|downfall]] of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] due to internal weaknesses and [[Muslim population growth]] in Western countries and the world generally. Based on his own observations, Steyn says that the fall of the Western world is caused by three factors, [[Demography|Demographic]] decline, unsustainability of the advanced Western social-democratic state, and exhaustion of civilization. By 2007, Steyn's ''America Alone'',  had already convinced many American conservatives that there was an imminent and inevitable Muslim invasion.<ref name=\"newrepublic_Hari_20070701\"/>  The [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] (CIC) filed [[Human rights complaints against Maclean's magazine|Human rights complaints against ''Maclean's'' magazine]]\u2014in which they accused the magazine of [[Islamophobia]]\u2014with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]], the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] and the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]], based partly on ''Maclean's'' publication of a chapter from Steyn's book, \"The Future Belongs to Islam\".\n\n==Overview==\nIn ''America Alone'', which is set in the context of the [[War on Terror|global war on terror]], Steyn argues that \"much of what we loosely call the [[Western world]] will not survive the [[21st century|twenty-first century]], and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes, including many if not most European countries.\"<ref name=\"Steyn_Regnery_2006\">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Steyn |title=America Alone: The End Of The World As We Know It |publisher= [[Regnery Publishing]]  |date = September 16, 2006 | pages= 224 | isbn =  0-89526-078-6| oclc= 70866885}}</ref>{{rp|xiii}} According to a July 1, 2007 ''[[The New Republic]]'' article, Steyn says that white people \"are too self-absorbed to breed\", while the Muslim population is increasing rapidly\u2014the 20 million European Muslims in 2006, will have increased to over 150 million by 2015. As a result, there will be a \"large-scale evacuation operations circa 2015\".

He said that civilization is exhausted because Western nations are so focused on moral and [[cultural relativism]]\u2014with \"diversity\" and \"racism\" as their new favorite words\u2014that they are unable to see that their existence is threatened.

The movement that eventually led to the project's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.\n\nThe dam was proposed for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been {{convert|180|MW}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/professor-west-reminds-tasmania-that-hydro-past-constrains-future/ |title=Professor West reminds Tasmania that hydro past constrains future |work=Tasmanian Times |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive [[Franklin River]], which joins the Gordon nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area]] register.\n\nThe campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the [[non-violent protest]]{{verify source|date=June 2015}} campaign against the building of three dams on [[Lake Pedder]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.\n\nIn December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer [[Peter Dombrovskis]], helped bring down the government of [[Malcolm Fraser]] at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. The new government, under [[Bob Hawke]], had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and [[Tasmanian Government]] followed, resulting in a landmark [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruling in the federal government's favour.<ref name=hca/>\n\n== Announcement of the plans ==\n{{Location map+ | Tasmania\n| caption = Original locations of the proposed dams in Tasmania\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n \u00a0{{Location map~ | Tasmania\n \u00a0 \u00a0| label = Gordon below Franklin \n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = -42.584\n    | lon_deg = 145.732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Dam #2\n    | position = right\n    | lat_deg = -42.376\n    | lon_deg = 145.757 }}\n}}\n\nIn 1978, the Tasmanian [[Hydro Electric Commission]] (HEC) announced intentions to construct the dam.

It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.\n\nHowever, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]], and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, [[Olegas Truchanas]], attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, ''The Last Wild River'', was shown on Tasmania's two commercial television stations.\n\nIn June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stephen  | first = Sarah  | title = 10th anniversary of the Franklin blockade  | magazine = Green Left Weekly  | issue= 80 | location = Sydney  | date = 18 November 1992  | url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2601 | accessdate = 9 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts at compromise ==\nThe [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] state government, under premier [[Doug Lowe (Australian politician)|Doug Lowe]], backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park|Wild Rivers National Park]]. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme.<ref>For maps of the proposed schemes see - Thompson, Peter (1981) ''Power In Tasmania'' ACF {{ISBN|0858020645}}  pp.36 noting the potential confusion for which schemes was what -''Integrated'' meant damming the King and Franklin as one, and the Lower Franklin and Oga rivers as the other.  ''Separate'' meant Gordon above the Olga, and The King  and Fraklin dammed the same as in the  Integrated scheme</ref> While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.\n\nIn July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative dominated Legislative Council then blocked the [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] government's 'Gordon-above-Olga' compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/history-franklin-river-campaign-1976-83|title=History of the Franklin River Campaign 1976-83 {{!}} The Wilderness Society|date=15 June 2001|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|access-date=13 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==\nIn 1981, [[Australian Democrats]] Senator [[Don Chipp]] initiated a Senate inquiry into \"the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world\" and \"the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance\".\n\nFrom early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years BP in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by [[geomorphology]] student Kevin Kieran in January 1977,<ref name =Griffiths/> and he first named it [[Fraser Cave]] by after the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]], because ''...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...'''.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_iceage_walktotasmania/index1.htm AUSTRALIA, An Ice Age - Walk to Tasmania]</ref> It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]].

In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" /> There had been a significant campaign for voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" />\n\nThe ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by [[Harry Holgate]], a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and [[Mary Willey]], another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. [[Norm Sanders]], an [[Australian Democrats]] MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]]. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== The campaigns broadens ==\nDuring 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states. The iconic \"No Dams\" triangle sticker was printed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.australiaforvisitors.com/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park.html | title=Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park | publisher=Australia for Visitors | date=2005\u20132011 | accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> Rallies and events were held in cities around Australia.  Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam's construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor [[David Bellamy]] addressed 5,000{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} people at a Melbourne rally.\n\nBy the end of 1982, any perception that \"greenies\" equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, [[Bob Brown]] and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet,<ref>The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column plugged this dinner a couple of days before.</ref><ref>Tim Lamble[?spelling] operated his programmed slide show with dual projectors fading in and out 35mm slides of Tasmanian wilderness photographs, set to recorded music.</ref> ABC's classical music radio station featured a \"Concert for the Franklin\", and electronics entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.\n\nIn the federal [[1982 Lowe by-election|Lowe by-election]] in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers<ref>Volunteers were co-opted from the Australian Conservation Foundation by the NSW South West Tasmania Committee.</ref> at every polling booth encouraged voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper, and 9% did so.<ref>Scrutineers issued this figure in a press release, suggesting a headline like \"Franklin River comes 3rd in by-election\".

On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at \"Warners Landing\" ({{coord|42|34|7|S|145|41|24|E|type:mountain_region:AU-TAS}}) drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in [[Hobart]] also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] to contest a seat in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was replaced in the Assembly by [[Bob Brown]], who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.\n\nThroughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist [[David Bellamy]] was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security [[HM Prison Risdon|Risdon Prison]] for a night, as there was nowhere else to hold him.\n\nIn February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled 'G-Day'. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.\n\nOn 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph:<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/63/p08a02.html Pictures Collection: Peter Dombrovskis Wilderness Images], National Library of Australia. \"The photograph made the Franklin River a household word, and became an icon of the environmentalist cause.\"</ref> ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'' by [[Peter Dombrovskis]].

The new [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], had vowed to stop the dam from being built,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://envlaw.com.au/tasmanian-dam-case/|title=Environmental Law Australia {{!}} Tasmanian Dam Case|website=envlaw.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke's majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke's government first passed regulations under the existing ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' 1975, and then passed the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. The issue was brought before the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the 'external affairs' provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam's construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'', Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe resulting court case became known as [[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government's favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since. Justice [[Lionel Murphy]] wrote most broadly of the Franklin Dam decision's broader environmental and social implications in terms of the [[UNESCO]] Convention's [[common heritage of humanity]] principle, stating that \"The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war...[t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity.\"<ref>Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.</ref> The High Court ruling ended the dam's construction, and the plans have never been revived.\n\nThe demise of plans for the Franklin Dam also largely ended the building of dams for the generation of hydroelectricity in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |author=Harries, David |title=Hydroelectricity in Australia: past, present and future |date=March 2011 |journal=Ecogeneration |publisher=Great Southern Press |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706183448/http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, dam-building by the Hydro was not finished. The corporation was still able to construct a 'compromise' power development scheme on the nearby [[King River, Tasmania|King River]] and [[Henty River]] to compensate for the loss of the potential power generation from the Franklin scheme. Further on in time, the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] - the reconstruction of the old Mount Lyell Abt Railway between [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] and Regatta point, was mainly financed by compensation funds allocated to the Tasmanian Government for the \"loss\" of the Franklin River or Gordon River dams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Postscript==\n\nIn April 1983 the Australian Government sent a [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage jet]] and later an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RF-111]],<ref>[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=158 Second \u2018spy\u2019 mission to Tasmania], 8 April 1983, Air Power Development Centre,Department of Defence</ref> from the Royal Australian Air Force, to undertake a reconnaissance mission over the dam to gather evidence that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Lowe, Doug |subject-link=Doug Lowe (Australian politician) |subject2=Brown, Bob |subject-link2=Bob Brown |subject3=Gray, Robin |subject-link3=Robin Gray (Australian politician) |subject4=Holgate, Harry |subject-link4=Harry Holgate |subject5=others |interviewer=Maura Angle |title=We look back at one of Tasmania's most defining periods in history, the Franklin dam dispute |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2003/s890008.htm |type=Interview: Transcript |work=[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] |publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] |location=[[Tasmania]] |date=27 June 2003 |year= |page= |pages= |access-date=11 July 2015  |quote=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf Papers on Parliament 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001024544/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf |date=1 October 2009 }} ''\"In preparing the Commonwealth's case for the inevitable High Court challenge by Tasmania, Evans earned the popular title of 'Biggles' for arranging to have Royal Australian Air Force planes fly 'spy flights' over the dam site to collect court evidence.\"'' (p27)</ref> One of the reconnaissance photographs showing the continuing work on the site is displayed at College of Law staff library in the [[Australian National University]].\n\nOn 1 July 2008, former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] spoke at Hobart's [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart|Grand Chancellor Hotel]] at a dinner to mark the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision on the [[Tasmanian Dam Case]]. He said the campaign to protect the [[Franklin River]] had important lessons for the struggle against [[global warming]]:\n\n{{quote|...I just want to really round off by saying how relevant, today, is the experience of that time 25 years ago - because we are now faced with unprecedented environmental challenge. The Gordon Below Franklin was, of course, a major issue. But, relatively speaking, it pales into insignificance, against the massive challenge that we as a world are facing now. The very question of survivability is at stake.\n\nAnd as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The [[conservatives]]: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost [[economic growth]]. You can't do it, you mustn't do it.\n\nWhat's the argument today? No, we now see, at a time where we have a Labor Government in power, which is committed to take all the decisions that need to be taken to meet this historically unparalleled challenge of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. As we have a government committed to action in that regard, we have the conservatives now playing politics on this issue. \n\nI want to say, I want to plead with the conservatives... Now, the conservatives, what do they go on about? They are always talking about family values... What is the greatest obligation that politicians of every party have towards their families now? To their kids, their grandkids and their kids? It is that we take action to pass on to them a planet which is inhabitable, viable and enjoyable. And we must challenge them, and say 'Are you serious about family values? Are you serious about putting family first? If you are, you have no alternative but to join with government and to join with organisations who are committed to bringing about that result'.\n\nI want to conclude by saying this to you all. We can best celebrate this great occasion, the great achievement of [[Bob Brown]] and those who he led, the great achievement of saving the Franklin. We can best celebrate that occasion, best honour those who worked to achieve that result, if we commit ourselves unequivocally... to persuading our society, to persuade our communities, but most of all to persuade our politicians in all political parties to commit themselves to taking action, here within [[Australia]], and combining to ensure that international action is taken to bring about that situation, which I say that we can pass on to our children, our grandchildren and their children, a planet which is safe, inhabitable and enjoyable.\" <ref>Former PM Bob Hawke.

The movement that eventually led to the project's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.\n\nThe dam was proposed for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been {{convert|180|MW}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/professor-west-reminds-tasmania-that-hydro-past-constrains-future/ |title=Professor West reminds Tasmania that hydro past constrains future |work=Tasmanian Times |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive [[Franklin River]], which joins the Gordon nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area]] register.\n\nThe campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the [[non-violent protest]]{{verify source|date=June 2015}} campaign against the building of three dams on [[Lake Pedder]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.\n\nIn December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer [[Peter Dombrovskis]], helped bring down the government of [[Malcolm Fraser]] at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. The new government, under [[Bob Hawke]], had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and [[Tasmanian Government]] followed, resulting in a landmark [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruling in the federal government's favour.<ref name=hca/>\n\n== Announcement of the plans ==\n{{Location map+ | Tasmania\n| caption = Original locations of the proposed dams in Tasmania\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n \u00a0{{Location map~ | Tasmania\n \u00a0 \u00a0| label = Gordon below Franklin \n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = -42.584\n    | lon_deg = 145.732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Dam #2\n    | position = right\n    | lat_deg = -42.376\n    | lon_deg = 145.757 }}\n}}\n\nIn 1978, the Tasmanian [[Hydro Electric Commission]] (HEC) announced intentions to construct the dam.

It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.\n\nHowever, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]], and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, [[Olegas Truchanas]], attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, ''The Last Wild River'', was shown on Tasmania's two commercial television stations.\n\nIn June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stephen  | first = Sarah  | title = 10th anniversary of the Franklin blockade  | magazine = Green Left Weekly  | issue= 80 | location = Sydney  | date = 18 November 1992  | url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2601 | accessdate = 9 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts at compromise ==\nThe [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] state government, under premier [[Doug Lowe (Australian politician)|Doug Lowe]], backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park|Wild Rivers National Park]]. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme.<ref>For maps of the proposed schemes see - Thompson, Peter (1981) ''Power In Tasmania'' ACF {{ISBN|0858020645}}  pp.36 noting the potential confusion for which schemes was what -''Integrated'' meant damming the King and Franklin as one, and the Lower Franklin and Oga rivers as the other.  ''Separate'' meant Gordon above the Olga, and The King  and Fraklin dammed the same as in the  Integrated scheme</ref> While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.\n\nIn July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative dominated Legislative Council then blocked the [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] government's 'Gordon-above-Olga' compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/history-franklin-river-campaign-1976-83|title=History of the Franklin River Campaign 1976-83 {{!}} The Wilderness Society|date=15 June 2001|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|access-date=13 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==\nIn 1981, [[Australian Democrats]] Senator [[Don Chipp]] initiated a Senate inquiry into \"the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world\" and \"the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance\".\n\nFrom early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years BP in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by [[geomorphology]] student Kevin Kieran in January 1977,<ref name =Griffiths/> and he first named it [[Fraser Cave]] by after the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]], because ''...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...'''.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_iceage_walktotasmania/index1.htm AUSTRALIA, An Ice Age - Walk to Tasmania]</ref> It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]].

In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" /> There had been a significant campaign for voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" />\n\nThe ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by [[Harry Holgate]], a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and [[Mary Willey]], another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. [[Norm Sanders]], an [[Australian Democrats]] MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]]. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== The campaigns broadens ==\nDuring 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states. The iconic \"No Dams\" triangle sticker was printed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.australiaforvisitors.com/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park.html | title=Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park | publisher=Australia for Visitors | date=2005\u20132011 | accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> Rallies and events were held in cities around Australia.  Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam's construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor [[David Bellamy]] addressed 5,000{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} people at a Melbourne rally.\n\nBy the end of 1982, any perception that \"greenies\" equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, [[Bob Brown]] and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet,<ref>The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column plugged this dinner a couple of days before.</ref><ref>Tim Lamble[?spelling] operated his programmed slide show with dual projectors fading in and out 35mm slides of Tasmanian wilderness photographs, set to recorded music.</ref> ABC's classical music radio station featured a \"Concert for the Franklin\", and electronics entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.\n\nIn the federal [[1982 Lowe by-election|Lowe by-election]] in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers<ref>Volunteers were co-opted from the Australian Conservation Foundation by the NSW South West Tasmania Committee.</ref> at every polling booth encouraged voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper, and 9% did so.<ref>Scrutineers issued this figure in a press release, suggesting a headline like \"Franklin River comes 3rd in by-election\". The following day's [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column reported this as 91% of voters refusing to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper.</ref> At that first 'Write-in' campaign, few people knew that they could write a message on their federal ballot paper without invalidating their vote.<ref>The federal law was that as long as additional writing on a ballot paper does not identify the voter or obscure their validly expressed intentions, then the vote remains valid.</ref> In the [[Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly|ACT House of Assembly]] mid-1982 election, 25% of voters wrote \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the federal Flinders by-election in Victoria in December 1982, 42% of voters wrote \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== Blockade ==\n[[Image:Rock island bend.jpg|300px|thumb|The photograph ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'', by [[Peter Dombrovskis]] was used by the [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] in advertising against the dam's construction ]]\nIn November 1982, the conflict stepped up a notch when Brown announced that a blockade of the dam site would begin on 14 December. On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at \"Warners Landing\" ({{coord|42|34|7|S|145|41|24|E|type:mountain_region:AU-TAS}}) drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in [[Hobart]] also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] to contest a seat in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was replaced in the Assembly by [[Bob Brown]], who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.\n\nThroughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist [[David Bellamy]] was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security [[HM Prison Risdon|Risdon Prison]] for a night, as there was nowhere else to hold him.\n\nIn February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled 'G-Day'. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.\n\nOn 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph:<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/63/p08a02.html Pictures Collection: Peter Dombrovskis Wilderness Images], National Library of Australia. \"The photograph made the Franklin River a household word, and became an icon of the environmentalist cause.\"</ref> ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'' by [[Peter Dombrovskis]].

The new [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], had vowed to stop the dam from being built,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://envlaw.com.au/tasmanian-dam-case/|title=Environmental Law Australia {{!}} Tasmanian Dam Case|website=envlaw.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke's majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke's government first passed regulations under the existing ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' 1975, and then passed the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. The issue was brought before the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the 'external affairs' provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam's construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'', Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe resulting court case became known as [[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government's favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since. Justice [[Lionel Murphy]] wrote most broadly of the Franklin Dam decision's broader environmental and social implications in terms of the [[UNESCO]] Convention's [[common heritage of humanity]] principle, stating that \"The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war...[t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity.\"<ref>Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.</ref> The High Court ruling ended the dam's construction, and the plans have never been revived.\n\nThe demise of plans for the Franklin Dam also largely ended the building of dams for the generation of hydroelectricity in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |author=Harries, David |title=Hydroelectricity in Australia: past, present and future |date=March 2011 |journal=Ecogeneration |publisher=Great Southern Press |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706183448/http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, dam-building by the Hydro was not finished. The corporation was still able to construct a 'compromise' power development scheme on the nearby [[King River, Tasmania|King River]] and [[Henty River]] to compensate for the loss of the potential power generation from the Franklin scheme. Further on in time, the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] - the reconstruction of the old Mount Lyell Abt Railway between [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] and Regatta point, was mainly financed by compensation funds allocated to the Tasmanian Government for the \"loss\" of the Franklin River or Gordon River dams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Postscript==\n\nIn April 1983 the Australian Government sent a [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage jet]] and later an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RF-111]],<ref>[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=158 Second \u2018spy\u2019 mission to Tasmania], 8 April 1983, Air Power Development Centre,Department of Defence</ref> from the Royal Australian Air Force, to undertake a reconnaissance mission over the dam to gather evidence that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Lowe, Doug |subject-link=Doug Lowe (Australian politician) |subject2=Brown, Bob |subject-link2=Bob Brown |subject3=Gray, Robin |subject-link3=Robin Gray (Australian politician) |subject4=Holgate, Harry |subject-link4=Harry Holgate |subject5=others |interviewer=Maura Angle |title=We look back at one of Tasmania's most defining periods in history, the Franklin dam dispute |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2003/s890008.htm |type=Interview: Transcript |work=[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] |publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] |location=[[Tasmania]] |date=27 June 2003 |year= |page= |pages= |access-date=11 July 2015  |quote=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf Papers on Parliament 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001024544/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf |date=1 October 2009 }} ''\"In preparing the Commonwealth's case for the inevitable High Court challenge by Tasmania, Evans earned the popular title of 'Biggles' for arranging to have Royal Australian Air Force planes fly 'spy flights' over the dam site to collect court evidence.\"'' (p27)</ref> One of the reconnaissance photographs showing the continuing work on the site is displayed at College of Law staff library in the [[Australian National University]].\n\nOn 1 July 2008, former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] spoke at Hobart's [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart|Grand Chancellor Hotel]] at a dinner to mark the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision on the [[Tasmanian Dam Case]]. He said the campaign to protect the [[Franklin River]] had important lessons for the struggle against [[global warming]]:\n\n{{quote|...I just want to really round off by saying how relevant, today, is the experience of that time 25 years ago - because we are now faced with unprecedented environmental challenge. The Gordon Below Franklin was, of course, a major issue. But, relatively speaking, it pales into insignificance, against the massive challenge that we as a world are facing now. The very question of survivability is at stake.\n\nAnd as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The [[conservatives]]: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost [[economic growth]]. You can't do it, you mustn't do it.\n\nWhat's the argument today? No, we now see, at a time where we have a Labor Government in power, which is committed to take all the decisions that need to be taken to meet this historically unparalleled challenge of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. As we have a government committed to action in that regard, we have the conservatives now playing politics on this issue. \n\nI want to say, I want to plead with the conservatives... Now, the conservatives, what do they go on about? They are always talking about family values... What is the greatest obligation that politicians of every party have towards their families now? To their kids, their grandkids and their kids? It is that we take action to pass on to them a planet which is inhabitable, viable and enjoyable. And we must challenge them, and say 'Are you serious about family values? Are you serious about putting family first? If you are, you have no alternative but to join with government and to join with organisations who are committed to bringing about that result'.\n\nI want to conclude by saying this to you all. We can best celebrate this great occasion, the great achievement of [[Bob Brown]] and those who he led, the great achievement of saving the Franklin. We can best celebrate that occasion, best honour those who worked to achieve that result, if we commit ourselves unequivocally... to persuading our society, to persuade our communities, but most of all to persuade our politicians in all political parties to commit themselves to taking action, here within [[Australia]], and combining to ensure that international action is taken to bring about that situation, which I say that we can pass on to our children, our grandchildren and their children, a planet which is safe, inhabitable and enjoyable.\" <ref>Former PM Bob Hawke.
