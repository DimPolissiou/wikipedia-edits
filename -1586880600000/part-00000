{"title_page": "Indirect election", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=February 2016}}\n{{Elections}}\n\nAn '''indirect momma\n''' is an [[election]] in which voters do not choose between [[candidate]]s for an office, but elect people who then choose.  It is one of the oldest forms of elections, and is still used today for many  [[President (government title)|president]]s, [[cabinet (government)|cabinets]], [[upper house]]s, and [[supranational legislature]]s. Presidents and prime ministers can be indirectly elected by parliaments or by a special body convened solely for that purpose. The election of the executive government in most [[parliamentary system]]s is indirect: elect the parliamentarians, who then elect the government including most prominently the [[prime minister]] from among themselves. Upper houses, especially of federal republics, can be indirectly elected by state legislatures or state governments. Similarly, supranational legislatures can be indirectly elected by constituent countries' legislatures or executive governments.\n\nExamples of indirectly elected individuals include:\n* the [[United States presidential election|election of the United States president and the vice president]] is indirect election. Voters elect the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], which then elects the president. The Electoral College is a controversial issue in American politics, as [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|the Electoral College vote may not agree with the popular vote]].\n* The president of the [[European Commission]] is nominated by the [[European Council]] and confirmed or denied by the directly elected [[European Parliament]] (see [[Elections_to_the_European_Parliament#Commission_President|Elections to the European Parliament]]).\n* in the United Kingdom, the prime minister usually is a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the lower, elected house of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and is the leader of the political party with the most seats able to command a majority either outright or by agreement with other parties. Similar arrangements are used in the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved assemblies]] and most [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]].\n* in [[Spain]], the [[Congress of Deputies]] votes on a [[motion of confidence]] of the [[Monarchy of Spain|king's]] nominee ([[Constitutional convention (political custom)|customarily]] the party leader whose party controls the Congress) and the nominee's [[political manifesto]], an example of an indirect election of the [[prime minister of Spain]].\n* Many countries with [[parliamentary system]]s elect their [[head of state]]  indirectly ([[President of Germany|Germany]], [[President of Italy|Italy]], [[President of Estonia|Estonia]], [[President of Latvia|Latvia]], [[President of Malta|Malta]], [[President of Hungary|Hungary]], [[President of India|India]], [[President of Israel|Israel]], [[President of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]). In most of these, head of state is merely a ceremonial [[figurehead]] with limited power.\n* Political party nominees can be indirectly elected in party conventions, such as in the United States. Local caucus attendants vote for delegates, who vote for a nominee in state conventions.\n\nSome examples of indirectly\n elected upper houses include:\n* the German [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], where voters elect the [[Landtag]] members, who then elect the state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat\n* In [[France]], election to the upper house of Parliament, the [[French Senate|S\u00e9nat]], is indirect. Electors (called \"[[Grands \u00e9lecteurs]]\") are locally elected representatives.\n* the Indian [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house of parliament) is indirectly elected, largely by state legislatures; [[Manmohan Singh]] was a member of the Rajya Sabha but chosen by the majority party in the [[Manmohan Singh#14th Lok Sabha|Lok Sabha]] (lower house of parliament) as the prime minister in 2004; as such, Singh as prime minister had never won a direct or popular election; introduced as a \"[[technocrat]]\"\n* the [[United States Senate]] was indirectly elected by state legislatures until, after a number of attempts over the previous century, the [[17th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1913.\n\nSome examples of indirectly elected supranational legislatures include:\n* the Parliamentary Assemblies of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[Western European Union|WEU]] and [[NATO]] - in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly\n* most bodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the [[United Nations General Assembly]], can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the national governments are [[democratically elected]] in the first place)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of democracy and elections-related topics]]\n* [[Proxy voting]]\n* [[Double direct election]]\n* [[Liquid democracy]]\n\n[[Category:Elections by type]]\n[[Category:Indirect elections| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=February 2016}}\n{{Elections}}\n\nAn '''indirect election''' is an [[election]] in which voters do not choose between [[candidate]]s for an office, but elect people who then choose.

Similar arrangements are used in the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved assemblies]] and most [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]].\n* in [[Spain]], the [[Congress of Deputies]] votes on a [[motion of confidence]] of the [[Monarchy of Spain|king's]] nominee ([[Constitutional convention (political custom)|customarily]] the party leader whose party controls the Congress) and the nominee's [[political manifesto]], an example of an indirect election of the [[prime minister of Spain]].\n* Many countries with [[parliamentary system]]s elect their [[head of state]]  indirectly ([[President of Germany|Germany]], [[President of Italy|Italy]], [[President of Estonia|Estonia]], [[President of Latvia|Latvia]], [[President of Malta|Malta]], [[President of Hungary|Hungary]], [[President of India|India]], [[President of Israel|Israel]], [[President of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]). In most of these, head of state is merely a ceremonial [[figurehead]] with limited power.\n* Political party nominees can be indirectly elected in party conventions, such as in the United States. Local caucus attendants vote for delegates, who vote for a nominee in state conventions.\n\nSome examples of indirectly\n elected upper houses include:\n* the German [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], where voters elect the [[Landtag]] members, who then elect the state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat\n* In [[France]], election to the upper house of Parliament, the [[French Senate|S\u00e9nat]], is indirect. Electors (called \"[[Grands \u00e9lecteurs]]\") are locally elected representatives.\n* the Indian [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house of parliament) is indirectly elected, largely by state legislatures; [[Manmohan Singh]] was a member of the Rajya Sabha but chosen by the majority party in the [[Manmohan Singh#14th Lok Sabha|Lok Sabha]] (lower house of parliament) as the prime minister in 2004; as such, Singh as prime minister had never won a direct or popular election; introduced as a \"[[technocrat]]\"\n* the [[United States Senate]] was indirectly elected by state legislatures until, after a number of attempts over the previous century, the [[17th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1913.\n\nSome examples of indirectly elected supranational legislatures include:\n* the Parliamentary Assemblies of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], the [[Western European Union|WEU]] and [[NATO]] - in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly\n* most bodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the [[United Nations General Assembly]], can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the national governments are [[democratically elected]] in the first place)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of democracy and elections-related topics]]\n* [[Proxy voting]]\n* [[Double direct election]]\n* [[Liquid democracy]]\n\n[[Category:Elections by type]]\n[[Category:Indirect elections| ]]\n", "name_user": "98.23.232.222", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_election"}

[[Iowa]] voters will elect state senators in half of the state senate's districts--the 25 even-numbered state senate districts. State senators serve four-year terms in the [[Iowa State Senate]], with half of the seats up for election each cycle. A statewide map of the 50 state Senate districts in the year 2020 is provided by the [[Iowa General Assembly]] [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/REDST/2011/2011-03-31/SenateStatewide8x11_color.pdf here.]\n\nThe primary election on June 2, 2020 will determine which candidates will appear on the November 3, 2020 general election ballot. The filing deadline was March 13, 2020. The names of primary election candidates who filed to run can be obtained here.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/pdf/Candidates/primarycandidatelist.pdf|title=Candidate List June 2,

Party|Republicans]] had control of the Iowa state Senate with 32 seats to [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]]' 18 seats. \n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from [[Iowa Republican

In his booklet, he also described tooth development and oral diseases, where he mentioned diet, infection, and oral hygiene as important factors.<ref name=\"Jacobsohn\" />\n\nAfter obtaining a degree, Wells set up a practice in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], with an associate named [[William T. G. Morton]], who would become famous for his use of [[diethyl ether|ether]] as an anesthetic on October 16, 1846.\n\n==Career==\nAfter he completed his dental training in Boston, Wells opened his own office in Hartford, Connecticut on April 4, 1836.<ref name=\"Gordon\">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Sarah H.|title=Wells, Horace|journal=American National Biography Online|date=February 2000}}</ref> Between 1841 and 1845, Wells became a reputable dentist in Hartford, where he had many patients and attracted apprentices. Among his patients were respected members of society such as William Ellsworth, the governor of Connecticut. His three apprentices were John Riggs, C. A. Kingsbury, and William Morton. In 1843, Wells and Morton started a practice in Boston and Wells continued to instruct Morton.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> John Riggs later became a partner and Kingsbury became one of the founders of Philadelphia Dental College.\n\nWells first witnessed the effects of nitrous oxide on December 10, 1844, when he and his wife Elizabeth attended a demonstration by [[Gardner Quincy Colton]] billed in the ''Hartford Courant'' as \"A Grand Exhibition of the Effects Produced by Inhaling Nitrous Oxide, Exhilarating, or Laughing Gas.\"<ref name=\"Finder\">{{cite journal|last1=Finder|first1=S.G.|title=Lessons from history: Horace Wells and the moral features of clinical contexts|journal=Anesthesia Progress|date=1995|volume=42|issue=1|pages=3\u20134}}</ref> The demonstration took place at Union Hall, Hartford. During the demonstration, a local apothecary shop clerk Samuel A. Cooley became intoxicated by [[nitrous oxide]]. While under the influence, Cooley did not react when he struck his legs against a wooden bench while jumping around.<ref name=\"Haridas\">{{cite journal|last1=Haridas|first1=Rajesh|title=Horace Wells' Demonstration of Nitrous Oxide in Boston|journal=Anesthesiology|date=November 2013|volume=119|issue=5|doi=10.1097/aln.0b013e3182a771ea}}</ref> After the demonstration, Cooley was unable to recall his actions while under the influence, but found abrasions and bruises on his knees. From this demonstration, Wells realized the potential for the analgesic properties of [[nitrous oxide]], and met with [[Gardner Quincy Colton|Colton]] about conducting trials.<ref name=\"Finder\" />\n\nThe following day, Wells conducted a trial on himself by inhaling [[nitrous oxide]] and having John Riggs extract a tooth.<ref name=\"Haridas\" /> Upon a successful trial where he did not feel any pain, Wells went on to use nitrous oxide on at least 12 other patients in his office.<ref name=\"Finder\" /> In 1844, Hartford did not have a hospital, so Wells sought to demonstrate his new findings in either Boston or New York. He chose to go to Boston in January 1845 where he previously studied dentistry, and also knew [[William T.G. Morton|William Morton]], a former student and associate.<ref name=\"Haridas\" /> Wells and Morton's practice was dissolved in October 1844, but they remained on friendly terms. Morton was enrolled in Harvard Medical School at the time and agreed to help Wells introduce his ideas, although Morton was skeptical about the use of nitrous oxide.<ref name=\"Haridas\" />\n\nHe gave a demonstration to medical students at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] on January 20, 1845. However, the gas was improperly administered and the patient cried out in [[pain]]. The patient later admitted that although he cried out in pain, he remembered no pain and did not know when the tooth was extracted.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> The audience of students in the surgical theatre jeered \"humbug\". After the embarrassment from his failed demonstration, Wells immediately returned home to Hartford the next day. Shortly after, he became ill and his dental practice became sporadic.\n\nOn February 5, 1845, Wells advertised his home for rent.<ref name=\"Haridas\" /> On April 7, 1845, Wells advertised in the ''Hartford Courant'' that he was going to dissolve his dental practice, and referred all his patients to Riggs, the man who had extracted his tooth.\n\nIn October 1846, Morton gave a successful demonstration of ether anesthesia in Boston. Following Morton's demonstration, Wells published a letter accounting his successful trials in 1844 in an attempt to claim the discovery of anesthesia. His efforts in establishing his claim were mostly unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Finder\" />\n\nDespite his advertisement for dissolving his practice in April 1845, Wells sporadically continued his practice, with his last daybook entry being on November 5, 1845.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n==Later years==\nWells closed his office nine times and relocated six different times between 1836 and 1847. He closed his office due to ill health, although his physician could not find any physical cause for his non-specific complaints.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> He mentioned his recurring illness in a letter to his sister Mary Wells Cole in April 1837. He also became ill shortly after marrying Elizabeth Wales in 1838 and having his only son Charles Thomas Wells.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> During winter months, he would not write letters to any family or friends, except for his published letter in 1846 after Morton's ether demonstration.\n\nWells definitively ended his dental practice in late 1845 and began selling shower baths for which he received a patent for on November 4, 1846.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> He also planned to sail to Paris to purchase paintings to resell in the United States. He traveled to Paris in early 1847, where he petitioned the Academie Royale de Medicine and the Parisian Medical Society for recognition in the discovery of anesthesia.<ref name=\"Finder\" />\n\nWells moved to New York City in January 1848, leaving his wife and young son behind in Hartford.<ref name=\"Aljohani\">{{cite journal|last1=Aljohani|first1=Sara|title=Horace Wells and His House on 120 Chambers St in New York Ciity|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|date=September 2015|volume=2|pages=28\u201329|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2015.09.006}}</ref> He lived alone at 120 Chambers St in Lower Manhattan and began self-experimenting with ether and chloroform, and he became addicted to chloroform.<ref name=\"Aljohani\" /> The effects were unknown of sniffing chloroform and ether.<ref>Smith, Ken.

He was committed to New York's infamous [[The Tombs|Tombs]] Prison. As the influence of the drug waned, his mind started to clear and he realised what he had done. He asked the guards to escort him to his house to pick up his shaving kit.<ref>Smith, Ken.  Raw Deal.

In addition, he was elected an honorary member and awarded an honorary MD degree. However, Wells died unaware of these decisions.<ref name=\"Jacobsohn\" /> Wells first voiced his concern for minimizing his patient's pain during dental procedures in 1841. He was known for caring about his patient's comfort.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> During his time as a dentist, Wells advocated for regular check ups for dental hygiene, and also began the practice of pediatric dentistry in order to start dental care early.\n\nThe [[American Dental Association]] honored Wells posthumously in 1864 as the discoverer of modern anesthesia, and the [[American Medical Association]] recognized his achievement in 1870.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/322/000161836/ |title=Horace Wells|work=nndb.com|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nA monument to Horace Wells was raised in the [[Place des \u00c9tats-Unis]], Paris.\n\n[[Hartford, Connecticut]], has a statue of Horace Wells in [[Bushnell Park]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n* The story of Dr. Wells' [[self-experimentation]] with drugs was explored in an episode of Science Channel's ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]'' in a story entitled \"Jekyll vs Hyde\", comparing it to the ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''.\n* A full-length theatrical production, entitled ''Ether Dome'', written by [[Elizabeth Egloff]] and directed by [[Michael Wilson (director)|Michael Wilson]] centers around the story of Horace Wells' discovery of [[nitrous oxide]] as an anesthetic, as well as the life of his protege and partner, [[William T.

In his booklet, he also described tooth development and oral diseases, where he mentioned diet, infection, and oral hygiene as important factors.<ref name=\"Jacobsohn\" />\n\nAfter obtaining a degree, Wells set up a practice in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], with an associate named [[William T. G. Morton]], who would become famous for his use of [[diethyl ether|ether]] as an anesthetic on October 16, 1846.\n\n==Career==\nAfter he completed his dental training in Boston, Wells opened his own office in Hartford, Connecticut on April 4, 1836.<ref name=\"Gordon\">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Sarah H.|title=Wells, Horace|journal=American National Biography Online|date=February 2000}}</ref> Between 1841 and 1845, Wells became a reputable dentist in Hartford, where he had many patients and attracted apprentices. Among his patients were respected members of society such as William Ellsworth, the governor of Connecticut. His three apprentices were John Riggs, C. A. Kingsbury, and William Morton. In 1843, Wells and Morton started a practice in Boston and Wells continued to instruct Morton.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> John Riggs later became a partner and Kingsbury became one of the founders of Philadelphia Dental College.\n\nWells first witnessed the effects of nitrous oxide on December 10, 1844, when he and his wife Elizabeth attended a demonstration by [[Gardner Quincy Colton]] billed in the ''Hartford Courant'' as \"A Grand Exhibition of the Effects Produced by Inhaling Nitrous Oxide, Exhilarating, or Laughing Gas.\"<ref name=\"Finder\">{{cite journal|last1=Finder|first1=S.G.|title=Lessons from history: Horace Wells and the moral features of clinical contexts|journal=Anesthesia Progress|date=1995|volume=42|issue=1|pages=3\u20134}}</ref> The demonstration took place at Union Hall, Hartford.

From this demonstration, Wells realized the potential for the analgesic properties of [[nitrous oxide]], and met with [[Gardner Quincy Colton|Colton]] about conducting trials.<ref name=\"Finder\" />\n\nThe following day, Wells conducted a trial on himself by inhaling [[nitrous oxide]] and having John Riggs extract a tooth.<ref name=\"Haridas\" /> Upon a successful trial where he did not feel any pain, Wells went on to use nitrous oxide on at least 12 other patients in his office.<ref name=\"Finder\" /> In 1844, Hartford did not have a hospital, so Wells sought to demonstrate his new findings in either Boston or New York. He chose to go to Boston in January 1845 where he previously studied dentistry, and also knew [[William T.G. Morton|William Morton]], a former student and associate.<ref name=\"Haridas\" /> Wells and Morton's practice was dissolved in October 1844, but they remained on friendly terms. Morton was enrolled in Harvard Medical School at the time and agreed to help Wells introduce his ideas, although Morton was skeptical about the use of nitrous oxide.<ref name=\"Haridas\" />\n\nHe gave a demonstration to medical students at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]] on January 20, 1845. However, the gas was improperly administered and the patient cried out in [[pain]]. The patient later admitted that although he cried out in pain, he remembered no pain and did not know when the tooth was extracted.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> The audience of students in the surgical theatre jeered \"humbug\". After the embarrassment from his failed demonstration, Wells immediately returned home to Hartford the next day. Shortly after, he became ill and his dental practice became sporadic.\n\nOn February 5, 1845, Wells advertised his home for rent.<ref name=\"Haridas\" /> On April 7, 1845, Wells advertised in the ''Hartford Courant'' that he was going to dissolve his dental practice, and referred all his patients to Riggs, the man who had extracted his tooth.\n\nIn October 1846, Morton gave a successful demonstration of ether anesthesia in Boston. Following Morton's demonstration, Wells published a letter accounting his successful trials in 1844 in an attempt to claim the discovery of anesthesia. His efforts in establishing his claim were mostly unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Finder\" />\n\nDespite his advertisement for dissolving his practice in April 1845, Wells sporadically continued his practice, with his last daybook entry being on November 5, 1845.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n==Later years==\nWells closed his office nine times and relocated six different times between 1836 and 1847. He closed his office due to ill health, although his physician could not find any physical cause for his non-specific complaints.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> He mentioned his recurring illness in a letter to his sister Mary Wells Cole in April 1837. He also became ill shortly after marrying Elizabeth Wales in 1838 and having his only son Charles Thomas Wells.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> During winter months, he would not write letters to any family or friends, except for his published letter in 1846 after Morton's ether demonstration.\n\nWells definitively ended his dental practice in late 1845 and began selling shower baths for which he received a patent for on November 4, 1846.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> He also planned to sail to Paris to purchase paintings to resell in the United States. He traveled to Paris in early 1847, where he petitioned the Academie Royale de Medicine and the Parisian Medical Society for recognition in the discovery of anesthesia.<ref name=\"Finder\" />\n\nWells moved to New York City in January 1848, leaving his wife and young son behind in Hartford.<ref name=\"Aljohani\">{{cite journal|last1=Aljohani|first1=Sara|title=Horace Wells and His House on 120 Chambers St in New York Ciity|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|date=September 2015|volume=2|pages=28\u201329|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2015.09.006}}</ref> He lived alone at 120 Chambers St in Lower Manhattan and began self-experimenting with ether and chloroform, and he became addicted to chloroform.<ref name=\"Aljohani\" /> The effects were unknown of sniffing chloroform and ether.<ref>Smith, Ken.

Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]].

These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.<ref>Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C.

Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=J.|date=|title=The Center for Collegiate Mental Health: Practice and research working together |journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=|pages=101\u2013104|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Effrig|first=Jessica C.|last2=Bieschke|first2=Kathleen J.|last3=Locke|first3=Benjamin D.|date=2011-09-01|title=Examining Victimization and Psychological Distress in Transgender College Students|journal=Journal of College Counseling|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=143\u2013157|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x|issn=2161-1882}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%.

These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific [[sexual arousal]] while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.<ref>Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C.

The young adults in this group have shown a higher risk of engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse when the exposure to transphobia is high. Therefore, as per the study shows a correlation between transphobia and high risk of HIV.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sugano|first=Eiko|last2=Nemoto|first2=Tooru|last3=Operario|first3=Don|date=2006|title=The Impact of Exposure to Transphobia on HIV Risk Behavior in a Sample of Transgendered Women of Color in San Francisco|journal=AIDS and Behavior|volume=10|issue = 2|pages=217\u2013225|doi=10.1007/s10461-005-9040-z|pmid=16362237|citeseerx=10.1.1.554.5857}}</ref>\n\n====Mental health====\nPeople who are transgender are more likely to experience some type of psychological distress because of the harassment and discrimination that comes with transphobia. Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=J.|date=|title=The Center for Collegiate Mental Health: Practice and research working together |journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=|pages=101\u2013104|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Effrig|first=Jessica C.|last2=Bieschke|first2=Kathleen J.|last3=Locke|first3=Benjamin D.|date=2011-09-01|title=Examining Victimization and Psychological Distress in Transgender College Students|journal=Journal of College Counseling|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=143\u2013157|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x|issn=2161-1882}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%.

Acts of transphobia such as undue denial of services, unfair dismissal from work places or stigmatization have far-reaching effects on the subjects such as low self-esteem, under-performance, stress, withdrawal or even depression. When it comes to the minorities, who are already proven to be undergoing various forms of discrimination, the consequences are even more exaggerated.

It is the sequel to 2014's ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' and was released for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Set within a fictionalized version of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] and its [[open world]] is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a [[Security hacker|hacker]] who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec. [[Cooperative gameplay|Cooperative multiplayer]] allows for competitive one-on-one combat and connecting with other players to neutralize a player who is causing havoc.\n\nUbisoft Montreal studied player feedback from the first game to assess what could be improved in ''Watch Dogs 2'' and the setting was researched by making frequent trips to [[California]]. [[Ubisoft Reflections]] was responsible for overhauling the driving mechanic. Real hackers were consulted to validate scripts and [[game mechanics]] for authenticity and references to real-life [[hacktivism]] were fictionalized, like the [[Project Chanology]] protest. The original soundtrack was composed by [[Hudson Mohawke]]. The game was released to overall positive reception from critics which praised the game for improving upon the original ''Watch Dogs'' in areas like the hacking, setting, characters and driving. However, character inconsistencies, firearms, and frequent technical issues \u2013 later [[Patch (computing)|patched]] \u2013 were cited as imperfections. A sequel, ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'', is in development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nSimilar to its predecessor, ''Watch Dogs 2'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game with [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements<ref name=\"action adventure\" /> and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] as Marcus Holloway, a young hacker. The game features an [[open world]] set in a fictionalized version of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]],<ref name=\"some compromise\" /><ref name=\"cite video game\" /> an area more than twice as large as the Chicago setting from ''[[Watch Dogs]]''.<ref name=\"arrested\" /> It consists of four different areas: [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], and [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name=\"silicon coast\" /> Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes, and boats.<ref name=\"eurogpre\" /> The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible.<ref name=\"to be more\" /> The player can shoot their weapons while driving.<ref name=\"GIPre\" /> Marcus also has improved [[acrobatic]] skills, and the ability to [[parkour]] around the city.<ref name=\"PolyPre\" /> The player can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a [[3D printer]]; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] weapon, a [[billiard ball]] attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, the player can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' [[taser]].<ref name=\"cite video game\" /><ref name=\"PolyPre\" /> ''Watch Dogs 2<sub>,</sub>'' like its predecessor, places a particular emphasis on using environmental apparatus and the terrain to Marcus' advantage. For example, a player may hack an A/C unit to produce an electric shock when an enemy nears it. Marcus may also employ his own modular taser devices and [[Land mine|explosives]] to use tactically against enemies.<ref name=\"alone\" /> When law enforcement witnesses the player committing a crime, or is alerted by a [[non-player character]] (NPC), police officers will attempt to arrest the player.<ref name=\"online\" /> The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Upgrades can be customized according to playstyles.<ref name=\"GIPre\" />\n\n[[File:Watch Dogs 2 gameplay.png|thumb|left|250px|Players can hack the environment around them to advance in the missions.]]\n\nMarcus can hack into various electronic devices connected to the ctOS system with his in-game smartphone.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /> For example, Marcus can modify the personal information of NPCs to have them arrested,<ref name=\"arrested\" /> hack and manipulate every mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by hacking cars and traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out \"mass hacking\", which hacks the electrical equipment of a large group of people.<ref name=\"mass traffic\" /> The player can also gain multiple options while hacking the same object. For instance, if the player attempts to hack a car, they can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and crash in a random direction.<ref name=\"box\" /> Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the first game, Marcus has an arsenal of advanced equipment, including a [[quadcopter]] and [[Remote control|remote-controlled car]], both of which can be used for remote hacking and scouting.<ref name=\"eurogpre\" /> Marcus' apparel can be customized with over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each area.<ref name=\"over 700\" /> The game features several main story missions, and side-missions known as \"operations\". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will increase.<ref name=\"GSpot2\" />\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nMultiplayer returns in ''Watch Dogs 2''. The game introduces a seamless [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] mode, in which players can meet and interact with other random players. They can explore the open world and complete missions together, which will also help players to gain followers. The game features an emote system, which allows players' characters to communicate with each other through basic gestures. The game can be played completely online or offline.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /> It also features four competitive multiplayer modes:\n* '''Hacking Invasion''': A one-versus-one competitive multiplayer mode, originally featured in the first game, in which a player covertly joins another player's single-player session and steals virtual data from them. The invading player must stay hidden while stealing the data, while the defending player must identify and kill the invading player.<ref name=\"hacking invasion\" />\n* '''Bounty Hunter''': A mode introduced in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Alternatively, a player can manually initialize this game mode. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game with the hope of killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them [[experience point]]s. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /><ref name=\"expired killing\" /> The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.<ref name=\"smartphone hunted\" />\n* '''Showd0wn''': A mode added in an update. In this mode, 2 teams of 2 players battle each other in short missions. Missions vary from the first team to steal the hard drives to the offensive team having to hack the servers the defensive team is protecting in a limited amount of time.<ref name=\"Senior-Apr2017\" />\n* '''Racing''': A mode added in an update. Up to four players compete in head-to-head races to reach the finish line with drones, ekarts, boats, and bikes.<ref name=\"IGN-Apr2017\" />\n* '''Man vs Machine''': A mode added in an update. Up to four players work together to take down a machine in a narrow time frame.<ref name=\"Dunning-May2017\" />\n* '''Loot Trucks''': A mode added in an update. Up to four players compete in a head-to-head battle to steal a valuable box from a truck, and escape the police and other players. This event has a chance to randomly occur while a player is free-roaming, but can also be manually triggered.<ref name=\"Senior-Apr2017\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2016, three years after the [[Watch Dogs|events of Chicago]], [[San Francisco]] becomes the first city to install the next generation of ctOS ('''c'''en'''t'''ral '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem) &ndash; a computing network connecting every device together into a single system, developed by technology company Blume. Hacker Marcus Holloway, punished for a crime he did not commit through ctOS 2.0, decides to join hacking group DedSec (composed of hackers Sitara, Wrench, Horatio, and Josh), and conducts an initiation test by hacking a Blume server farm to wipe his profile from the system. DedSec determines that the new ctOS can covertly harm innocent citizens across the city, and thus decide to bring about awareness of their goals through conducting a social media campaign to recruit, by exposing corruption and crimes being conducted through the system, before bringing down Blume.\n\nAfter a number of successful exposures, Josh discovers a number of irregularities in their follower numbers. When Marcus investigates this, he learns that DedSec has been used by Blume's CTO Du\u0161an Nemec, in order to sell ctOS 2.0 to those frightened at being hacked. Forced to leave the city for a while, DedSec partake in a hacking event in the desert, and encounter legendary hacker Raymond \"T-Bone\" Kenney. Interested in assisting them, Raymond joins with DedSec as they work to continue their fight against Blume. After hacking the server farm of a major internet company, the group use the data they acquire to pursue and expose corruption amongst law enforcement officers, politicians, and numerous [[Silicon Valley]] corporations, while Marcus also focuses on bringing down several crime gangs, after one group murders Horatio for refusing to co-operate in their crimes. At the same time, Du\u0161an attempts to disrupt DedSec's operations by combating them with a rival hacking group and the [[FBI]], only for Marcus to counter his efforts.\n\nEventually, DedSec comes across information about the data manipulation program called \"Bellwether\", designed by Raymond, and learn that with both this and a new satellite network, designed to bypass [[Submarine communications cable|undersea data cables]], Du\u0161an plans to manipulate world finances and politics, thus creating a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data. To expose this and his corruption, DedSec co-ordinate a massive operation to allow Marcus to infiltrate Blume's San Francisco headquarters, hack their servers, and feed the information of Du\u0161an's crimes to the police. Du\u0161an is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and that it is time to put their own plans into motion. The filename of the recording seen in the ending is a set of coordinates located in [[Brixton]], [[London]].\n\n== Development ==\nAt [[E3 2014]], [[Ubisoft]] executive Tony Key claimed they were satisfied with the sales of the first game, and that the brand would be turned into a long-running franchise.<ref name=\"key turned\" /> According to creative director Jonathan Morin, the first game's main goal was to establish the ''Watch Dogs'' brand. It was intended that they take risks with the sequel, instead of creating a more polished version of the previous game.<ref name=\"polished risks\" /> To improve the game, Morin and his team read the reviews of the first game, and visited [[NeoGAF]] and various forums to study player feedback. Their priorities included creating a \"believable\" environment, giving players more freedom, and introducing a new leading character, whose personality would be completely different from that of the protagonist of the first game, Aiden Pearce.<ref name=\"GSpot2\" /> The primary developer [[Ubisoft Montreal]] worked with other subsidiaries [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Paris]], [[Ubisoft Bucharest]], [[Ubisoft Kiev]], and [[Ubisoft Reflections]] to aid in the production.<ref name=\"subsidiaries\" /> The driving mechanic was completely overhauled to make it more accessible to players, and was developed by Ubisoft Reflections, the developer of Ubisoft's own ''[[Driver (series)|Driver]]'' series.<ref name=\"driver accessible\" /> In light of complaints about a graphical downgrade in ''Watch Dogs'' from what was seen at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012|E3 2012]], Ubisoft assured that ''Watch Dogs 2'' would not suffer the same outcome because, unlike the first installment, it was developed for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] from the start.<ref name=\"unlike\" /> Another improvement from the first game was a more prominent thematic connection to the narrative.<ref name=\"the more\" /> Main operations are structured like story arcs that last up to ninety minutes each, advancing the plot with each completion.<ref name=\"main half\" />\n\nThe developer worked with consultant [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who would validate their scripts, including the use of [[jargon]], and [[Game mechanics|gameplay mechanics]] in order to ensure the authenticity of the subject matter. The [[propaganda]] used by the game's hacker group DedSec was influenced by [[GIF#Animated GIF|animated GIF]] culture, [[glitch art]] and comic books from the late 1940s.<ref name=\"jargon\" /> David Maynor served as a hacking advisor.<ref name=\"Adweek-Nov2016\" /> Content director Thomas Geffroyd, who had twenty years of experience with the hacking community, was tasked to accumulate information from hacktivists \u2013 such as author [[Violet Blue]] \u2013 and then relay it to the team. The game also features references to real life and 21st century brands; [[Project Chanology]] was fictionalized in the mission \"The False Prophets\"<ref name=\"false violet\" /> and 'noodle' is allegory of [[Google]] both in terms of logo, colours and the casual work ethic. \n\nUbisoft Montreal made frequent scouting trips to [[California]] to research the setting, and attempted to put most of the local landmarks in that region in the game. For regions that they could not put in the game, the team redesigned these locations and put them back into the game. According to producer Dominic Guay, having realistic and accurate locations featured in the game was essential for the game as they encourage players to explore the [[open world]]. Unlike many of Ubisoft's previous open world games, players do not need to climb towers in order to discover locations and missions. Instead, the game is opened up from the start, allowing players to explore the city freely. The game's new progression system, which tasks players to gain followers instead of completing main missions, was another way Ubisoft Montreal hoped to encourage exploration and make the city feel more \"free\".<ref name=\"frequent\" /><ref name=\"free city\" /> ''Watch Dogs 2'' had around sixty programmers devoted to its development.<ref name=\"sixty 2\" />\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Hudson Mohawke]]. Ingrained with a combination of [[electronic music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], it was approached from the palette of cult science fiction music.<ref name=\"electronic palette\" /> Ubisoft teamed up with Dutch music producer [[Oliver Heldens]] to influence the video for his track \"Good Life\" in the vein of DedSec.<ref name=\"dutch life\" /> For acquiring licensed songs, an agreement was made with [[Amoeba Music]].<ref name=\"sixty 2\" /> Mohawke's soundtrack was released separately as ''DedSec \u2013 Watch Dogs 2 (Original Game Soundtrack)'' via [[Warp Records]].<ref name=\"warp\" />\n\nA sequel to ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' was rumored since its release but first officialized by publisher Ubisoft through financial reports in February<ref name=\"rumoured reports\" /> and May 2016,<ref name=\"what month is five\" /> before it was confirmed as a part of the 2016 E3 lineup. A 20-minute online reveal was hosted a couple of days later.<ref name=\"twenty-minute days\" /> On October 27, 2016, ''Watch Dogs 2'' was announced to have been [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|released to manufacturing]].<ref name=\"gold watch\" />\n\n== Release ==\nOn June 8, 2016, Ubisoft revealed the game would be released on November 15 of that year for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in six separate editions.<ref name=\"six windows\" /> In September 2016, it was announced that ''Watch Dogs 2'' would have enhancements on [[PlayStation 4 Pro]].<ref name=\"selection\" /> In October 2016, Ubisoft announced that the Windows version was delayed to November 29, 2016 to ensure that the game was well-optimized.<ref name=\"well-delayed\" /> It was featured on the front cover of ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' in August.<ref name=\"w4tch\" /> Two weeks from release, Ubisoft and [[Samsung]] partnered to bundle a free digital download of ''Watch Dogs 2'' with the purchase of their [[solid-state disk]]s or curved gaming monitors.<ref name=\"curved purchase\" /> [[Amazon.com|Amazon Prime]] copies were subject to an early release, which revealed issues with the seamless multiplayer. Ubisoft vowed to repair the feature on schedule<ref name=\"seamless release\" /> but on the day of release, the company said it was broken \u2013 citing persistent [[lag]]ging and [[Crash (computing)|crashing]].<ref name=\"crash lagging\" /> Cooperative multiplayer was enabled a week after the game's release.<ref name=\"cooperative problems\" /> A free trial lasting three hours was released for PlayStation 4 on January 17, 2017; the Xbox One version was downloadable on January 24.<ref name=\"free three\" />\n\nPre-ordering \"The Gold Edition Collector's Edition\" included additional content such as weapon skins, vehicles and drones; the \"Deluxe Collector's Edition\" contains the same, but excluded the [[Season pass (video gaming)|season pass]]. Each of these, as well as the generic \"Collector's Edition\", contained a physical [[robot]] called \"Wrench Junior\", controlled by a [[mobile app]] on a [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer]]. The \"Gold Edition\" came with the same items and season pass, and while the \"Deluxe Edition\" omitted the inclusion of the season pass, it contained all other additions.<ref name=\"wrench junior\" /> The mission \"Zodiac Killer\" was also exclusive to pre-order purchases. It involves the protagonist Marcus Holloway in chasing a [[Copycat crime|copycat killer]] emulating the same [[modus operandi]] as the [[Zodiac Killer]].<ref name=\"zodiac senior\" /> Amazon and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch Prime]] members were privy to free content like [[Experience point|XP]] boosts and skin packs.<ref name=\"skin twitch\" /> \"ScoutXpedition\", a PlayStation 4 pre-order bonus mission, became free to download in January 2017.<ref name=\"ScoutXpedition\" />\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\nFive downloadable content (DLC) packs have been released: the \"T-Bone Content Bundle\", \"Human Conditions\", \"No Compromise\", \"Root Access Bundle\", and \"Psychedelic Pack\".<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" /> As per an exclusivity agreement with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]], all DLCs for ''Watch Dogs 2'' were timed exclusives for PlayStation 4.<ref name=\"polygon-ps4exclusive\" />\n* Root Access Bundle (available in December 2016)<ref name=\"access root\" /> and Psychedelic Pack (available on launch day) feature a Zodiac Killer mission as well as new outfits, cars, skins, and weapons.<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" />\n* The T-Bone Content Bundle was released for PlayStation 4 on December 22, 2016,<ref name=\"t-boned\" /> and includes a new co-op difficulty setting, \"Mayhem\", plus the clothes and truck of the original ''Watch Dogs'' character Raymond \"T-Bone\" Kenney.<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" />\n* Human Conditions was released on February 21, 2017 for the PlayStation 4 and on March 23 for the Xbox One and PC,<ref name=\"hum4nc0nd1t10n5\" /> and includes three new stories set in San Francisco's science and medicine industries. The pack also includes new co-op missions featuring a new enemy class called \"the Jammer\", a technologically savvy enemy capable of jamming all of a player's hacker equipment, making them vulnerable to head-on attacks.<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" />\n* No Compromise was released on April 18, 2017 for PlayStation 4 and was launched on 18 May for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, featuring a new story mission, outfits and weapons.<ref name=\"no compromise\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 75/100<ref name=\"MC-PC\" /><br>(PS4) 82/100<ref name=\"MC-PS4\" /><br>(XONE) 81/100<ref name=\"MC-XONE\" />\n| Destruct = 8.5/10<ref name=\"Destruct\" />\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGM\" />\n| GI = 7.75/10<ref name=\"GI\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| IGN = 8.5/10<ref name=\"IGNpage2\" />\n| Poly = 8/10<ref name=\"Poly\" />\n| VG = 8/10<ref name=\"VG\" />\n}}\n\n''Watch Dogs 2'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MC-PC\" /><ref name=\"MC-PS4\" /><ref name=\"MC-XONE\" /> Technical issues on consoles were fixed with the Update 1.04 [[Patch (computing)|patch]].<ref name=\"fixed patch\" /> In his review, ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Zack Furniss praised the sequel's tonal shift to a lack of seriousness and stated that its protagonist Marcus Holloway boasted a similar charm and wit. He thought well of the hacking component as it was suggestible to multiple fields of use, and enjoyed its nature of compatibility with a non-lethal approach; in fact, Furniss felt that for this reason firearms could have been excluded entirely. The driving was lauded as an improvement from the first game, yet technical issues like [[glitch]]es and low [[frame rate]]s were cited as shortcomings.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> To Matt Buchholtz, writing for ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'', the game signified \"less a hacktivist tale and more a beautiful immersion into the San Francisco Bay\". The setting, characters and story were cited as considerable refinements from its predecessor. Buchholtz discerned that the tasks demanded to gain followers were successful in encouraging world exploration. He noted however that \u2013 in context of the main character \u2013 murder made little sense, which led to increased usage of stealth.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> Elise Favis at ''[[Game Informer]]'' both disparaged and praised elements in comparison to those of ''Watch Dogs''. She enjoyed that hacking was prioritized in the gameplay and the new \"smoother\" driving mechanic, but saw inconsistencies in the protagonist's actions versus his personality and thought supporting characters \"too obnoxious and petty to be meaningful companions\". Favis also experienced low frame rate capabilities on PlayStation 4.<ref name=\"GI\" />\n\nAron Garst of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' stated that ''Watch Dogs 2'' had redressed \"nearly every negative aspect of the original\", and as such, marked a favorable change in the franchise.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Dan Stapleton liked Marcus Holloway more than Aiden Pearce of the first game, and similarly appreciated the supporting characters of DedSec. Marcus' penchant for moral integrity was a noticeable contradiction for Stapleton, though, in light of the prospect to have him kill innocent people if one so chooses. Therefore, the character's personality was observed as the only preclusion to violence and an axiomatic push toward the stealth approach, which Stapleton insisted was the most accommodating of available tools.<ref name=\"IGNpage1\" /> Writing for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Philip Kollar saw that ''Watch Dogs 2'' could appeal to those able to connect with \"being young, angry at the system and certain that you know what's best for the world\". Its [[tongue-in-cheek]] demeanor was said to naturally coincide with the hacker culture and [[open world]] genre. [[San Francisco]] \u2013 the spaces of which were described as \"cleverly designed\" \u2013 never felt overwhelming in size to Kollar but inspired joy as he took advantage of the immediate ability to explore it entirely. His complaints concerned firearms; their use was considered \"a complete failure of imagination\" and unbelievable from the members of DedSec \u2014 \"an [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]-esque group of peaceful hacktivists\".<ref name=\"Poly\" /> Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote in her verdict, \"''Watch Dogs 2'' is missing a bit of refinement, and has had issues with multiplayer, but joining DedSec is still a riot and a half. It's high energy fun with engaging characters, and you can make an entire city your playground\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n=== Sales ===\nIn November 2016, Ubisoft revealed that the game's pre-orders were disappointing for the company. Due to this, Ubisoft took a more conservative approach and reduced the sales projection for the second half of its fiscal year 2017. However, CEO Yves Guillemot was confident that the game would not be a commercial failure, and compared the game to ''[[Far Cry 3]]'', a commercially successful game with low pre-order sales. He believed that reviews would have a great impact to the game sales due to consumers' \"wait-and-see\" approach.<ref name=\"IGN-Nov2016\" /><ref name=\"wait-and-see\" /> ''Watch Dogs 2'' was the second-best-selling retail video game in the United Kingdom in its week of release, according to [[Chart-Track]], an eighty percent decrease from the sales of the original.<ref name=\"chart-track\" /><ref name=\"eighty percent\" /> In the United States, the game ranked number eight in sales in January 2017.<ref name=\"moj\" /> The PlayStation 4 version sold 68,796 copies in Japan.<ref name=\"Siliconera-Dec2016\" />\n\n== Sequel ==\nA sequel, ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'', was teased by [[Ubisoft]] via [[Twitter]] a week before the official announcement at [[E3 2019]],<ref

It is the sequel to 2014's ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' and was released for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Set within a fictionalized version of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] and its [[open world]] is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a [[Security hacker|hacker]] who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec. [[Cooperative gameplay|Cooperative multiplayer]] allows for competitive one-on-one combat and connecting with other players to neutralize a player who is causing havoc.\n\nUbisoft Montreal studied player feedback from the first game to assess what could be improved in ''Watch Dogs 2'' and the setting was researched by making frequent trips to [[California]]. [[Ubisoft Reflections]] was responsible for overhauling the driving mechanic. Real hackers were consulted to validate scripts and [[game mechanics]] for authenticity and references to real-life [[hacktivism]] were fictionalized, like the [[Project Chanology]] protest. The original soundtrack was composed by [[Hudson Mohawke]]. The game was released to overall positive reception from critics which praised the game for improving upon the original ''Watch Dogs'' in areas like the hacking, setting, characters and driving. However, character inconsistencies, firearms, and frequent technical issues \u2013 later [[Patch (computing)|patched]] \u2013 were cited as imperfections. A sequel, ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'', is in development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nSimilar to its predecessor, ''Watch Dogs 2'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game with [[Stealth game|stealth]] elements<ref name=\"action adventure\" /> and played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] as Marcus Holloway, a young hacker. The game features an [[open world]] set in a fictionalized version of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]],<ref name=\"some compromise\" /><ref name=\"cite video game\" /> an area more than twice as large as the Chicago setting from ''[[Watch Dogs]]''.<ref name=\"arrested\" /> It consists of four different areas: [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]], and [[Silicon Valley]].<ref name=\"silicon coast\" /> Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes, and boats.<ref name=\"eurogpre\" /> The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible.<ref name=\"to be more\" /> The player can shoot their weapons while driving.<ref name=\"GIPre\" /> Marcus also has improved [[acrobatic]] skills, and the ability to [[parkour]] around the city.<ref name=\"PolyPre\" /> The player can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a [[3D printer]]; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] weapon, a [[billiard ball]] attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, the player can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' [[taser]].<ref name=\"cite video game\" /><ref name=\"PolyPre\" /> ''Watch Dogs 2<sub>,</sub>'' like its predecessor, places a particular emphasis on using environmental apparatus and the terrain to Marcus' advantage. For example, a player may hack an A/C unit to produce an electric shock when an enemy nears it. Marcus may also employ his own modular taser devices and [[Land mine|explosives]] to use tactically against enemies.<ref name=\"alone\" /> When law enforcement witnesses the player committing a crime, or is alerted by a [[non-player character]] (NPC), police officers will attempt to arrest the player.<ref name=\"online\" /> The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Upgrades can be customized according to playstyles.<ref name=\"GIPre\" />\n\n[[File:Watch Dogs 2 gameplay.png|thumb|left|250px|Players can hack the environment around them to advance in the missions.]]\n\nMarcus can hack into various electronic devices connected to the ctOS system with his in-game smartphone.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /> For example, Marcus can modify the personal information of NPCs to have them arrested,<ref name=\"arrested\" /> hack and manipulate every mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by hacking cars and traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out \"mass hacking\", which hacks the electrical equipment of a large group of people.<ref name=\"mass traffic\" /> The player can also gain multiple options while hacking the same object. For instance, if the player attempts to hack a car, they can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and crash in a random direction.<ref name=\"box\" /> Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the first game, Marcus has an arsenal of advanced equipment, including a [[quadcopter]] and [[Remote control|remote-controlled car]], both of which can be used for remote hacking and scouting.<ref name=\"eurogpre\" /> Marcus' apparel can be customized with over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each area.<ref name=\"over 700\" /> The game features several main story missions, and side-missions known as \"operations\". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will increase.<ref name=\"GSpot2\" />\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nMultiplayer returns in ''Watch Dogs 2''. The game introduces a seamless [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] mode, in which players can meet and interact with other random players. They can explore the open world and complete missions together, which will also help players to gain followers. The game features an emote system, which allows players' characters to communicate with each other through basic gestures. The game can be played completely online or offline.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /> It also features four competitive multiplayer modes:\n* '''Hacking Invasion''': A one-versus-one competitive multiplayer mode, originally featured in the first game, in which a player covertly joins another player's single-player session and steals virtual data from them. The invading player must stay hidden while stealing the data, while the defending player must identify and kill the invading player.<ref name=\"hacking invasion\" />\n* '''Bounty Hunter''': A mode introduced in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Alternatively, a player can manually initialize this game mode. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game with the hope of killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them [[experience point]]s. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires.<ref name=\"cite video game\" /><ref name=\"expired killing\" /> The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.<ref name=\"smartphone hunted\" />\n* '''Showd0wn''': A mode added in an update. In this mode, 2 teams of 2 players battle each other in short missions. Missions vary from the first team to steal the hard drives to the offensive team having to hack the servers the defensive team is protecting in a limited amount of time.<ref name=\"Senior-Apr2017\" />\n* '''Racing''': A mode added in an update. Up to four players compete in head-to-head races to reach the finish line with drones, ekarts, boats, and bikes.<ref name=\"IGN-Apr2017\" />\n* '''Man vs Machine''': A mode added in an update. Up to four players work together to take down a machine in a narrow time frame.<ref name=\"Dunning-May2017\" />\n* '''Loot Trucks''': A mode added in an update. Up to four players compete in a head-to-head battle to steal a valuable box from a truck, and escape the police and other players. This event has a chance to randomly occur while a player is free-roaming, but can also be manually triggered.<ref name=\"Senior-Apr2017\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2016, three years after the [[Watch Dogs|events of Chicago]], [[San Francisco]] becomes the first city to install the next generation of ctOS ('''c'''en'''t'''ral '''O'''perating '''S'''ystem) &ndash; a computing network connecting every device together into a single system, developed by technology company Blume. Hacker Marcus Holloway, punished for a crime he did not commit through ctOS 2.0, decides to join hacking group DedSec (composed of hackers Sitara, Wrench, Horatio, and Josh), and conducts an initiation test by hacking a Blume server farm to wipe his profile from the system. DedSec determines that the new ctOS can covertly harm innocent citizens across the city, and thus decide to bring about awareness of their goals through conducting a social media campaign to recruit, by exposing corruption and crimes being conducted through the system, before bringing down Blume.\n\nAfter a number of successful exposures, Josh discovers a number of irregularities in their follower numbers. When Marcus investigates this, he learns that DedSec has been used by Blume's CTO Du\u0161an Nemec, in order to sell ctOS 2.0 to those frightened at being hacked. Forced to leave the city for a while, DedSec partake in a hacking event in the desert, and encounter legendary hacker Raymond \"T-Bone\" Kenney. Interested in assisting them, Raymond joins with DedSec as they work to continue their fight against Blume. After hacking the server farm of a major internet company, the group use the data they acquire to pursue and expose corruption amongst law enforcement officers, politicians, and numerous [[Silicon Valley]] corporations, while Marcus also focuses on bringing down several crime gangs, after one group murders Horatio for refusing to co-operate in their crimes. At the same time, Du\u0161an attempts to disrupt DedSec's operations by combating them with a rival hacking group and the [[FBI]], only for Marcus to counter his efforts.\n\nEventually, DedSec comes across information about the data manipulation program called \"Bellwether\", designed by Raymond, and learn that with both this and a new satellite network, designed to bypass [[Submarine communications cable|undersea data cables]], Du\u0161an plans to manipulate world finances and politics, thus creating a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data. To expose this and his corruption, DedSec co-ordinate a massive operation to allow Marcus to infiltrate Blume's San Francisco headquarters, hack their servers, and feed the information of Du\u0161an's crimes to the police. Du\u0161an is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and that it is time to put their own plans into motion. The filename of the recording seen in the ending is a set of coordinates located in [[Brixton]], [[London]].\n\n== Development ==\nAt [[E3 2014]], [[Ubisoft]] executive Tony Key claimed they were satisfied with the sales of the first game, and that the brand would be turned into a long-running franchise.<ref name=\"key turned\" /> According to creative director Jonathan Morin, the first game's main goal was to establish the ''Watch Dogs'' brand. It was intended that they take risks with the sequel, instead of creating a more polished version of the previous game.<ref name=\"polished risks\" /> To improve the game, Morin and his team read the reviews of the first game, and visited [[NeoGAF]] and various forums to study player feedback. Their priorities included creating a \"believable\" environment, giving players more freedom, and introducing a new leading character, whose personality would be completely different from that of the protagonist of the first game, Aiden Pearce.<ref name=\"GSpot2\" /> The primary developer [[Ubisoft Montreal]] worked with other subsidiaries [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Paris]], [[Ubisoft Bucharest]], [[Ubisoft Kiev]], and [[Ubisoft Reflections]] to aid in the production.<ref name=\"subsidiaries\" /> The driving mechanic was completely overhauled to make it more accessible to players, and was developed by Ubisoft Reflections, the developer of Ubisoft's own ''[[Driver (series)|Driver]]'' series.<ref name=\"driver accessible\" /> In light of complaints about a graphical downgrade in ''Watch Dogs'' from what was seen at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012|E3 2012]], Ubisoft assured that ''Watch Dogs 2'' would not suffer the same outcome because, unlike the first installment, it was developed for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] from the start.<ref name=\"unlike\" /> Another improvement from the first game was a more prominent thematic connection to the narrative.<ref name=\"the more\" /> Main operations are structured like story arcs that last up to ninety minutes each, advancing the plot with each completion.<ref name=\"main half\" />\n\nThe developer worked with consultant [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] who would validate their scripts, including the use of [[jargon]], and [[Game mechanics|gameplay mechanics]] in order to ensure the authenticity of the subject matter. The [[propaganda]] used by the game's hacker group DedSec was influenced by [[GIF#Animated GIF|animated GIF]] culture, [[glitch art]] and comic books from the late 1940s.<ref name=\"jargon\" /> David Maynor served as a hacking advisor.<ref name=\"Adweek-Nov2016\" /> Content director Thomas Geffroyd, who had twenty years of experience with the hacking community, was tasked to accumulate information from hacktivists \u2013 such as author [[Violet Blue]] \u2013 and then relay it to the team. The game also features references to real life; [[Project Chanology]] was fictionalized in the mission \"The False Prophets\".<ref name=\"false violet\" />\n\nUbisoft Montreal made frequent scouting trips to [[California]] to research the setting, and attempted to put most of the local landmarks in that region in the game. For regions that they could not put in the game, the team redesigned these locations and put them back into the game. According to producer Dominic Guay, having realistic and accurate locations featured in the game was essential for the game as they encourage players to explore the [[open world]]. Unlike many of Ubisoft's previous open world games, players do not need to climb towers in order to discover locations and missions. Instead, the game is opened up from the start, allowing players to explore the city freely. The game's new progression system, which tasks players to gain followers instead of completing main missions, was another way Ubisoft Montreal hoped to encourage exploration and make the city feel more \"free\".<ref name=\"frequent\" /><ref name=\"free city\" /> ''Watch Dogs 2'' had around sixty programmers devoted to its development.<ref name=\"sixty 2\" />\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by [[Hudson Mohawke]]. Ingrained with a combination of [[electronic music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], it was approached from the palette of cult science fiction music.<ref name=\"electronic palette\" /> Ubisoft teamed up with Dutch music producer [[Oliver Heldens]] to influence the video for his track \"Good Life\" in the vein of DedSec.<ref name=\"dutch life\" /> For acquiring licensed songs, an agreement was made with [[Amoeba Music]].<ref name=\"sixty 2\" /> Mohawke's soundtrack was released separately as ''DedSec \u2013 Watch Dogs 2 (Original Game Soundtrack)'' via [[Warp Records]].<ref name=\"warp\" />\n\nA sequel to ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' was rumored since its release but first officialized by publisher Ubisoft through financial reports in February<ref name=\"rumoured reports\" /> and May 2016,<ref name=\"what month is five\" /> before it was confirmed as a part of the 2016 E3 lineup. A 20-minute online reveal was hosted a couple of days later.<ref name=\"twenty-minute days\" /> On October 27, 2016, ''Watch Dogs 2'' was announced to have been [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|released to manufacturing]].<ref name=\"gold watch\" />\n\n== Release ==\nOn June 8, 2016, Ubisoft revealed the game would be released on November 15 of that year for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in six separate editions.<ref name=\"six windows\" /> In September 2016, it was announced that ''Watch Dogs 2'' would have enhancements on [[PlayStation 4 Pro]].<ref name=\"selection\" /> In October 2016, Ubisoft announced that the Windows version was delayed to November 29, 2016 to ensure that the game was well-optimized.<ref name=\"well-delayed\" /> It was featured on the front cover of ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' in August.<ref name=\"w4tch\" /> Two weeks from release, Ubisoft and [[Samsung]] partnered to bundle a free digital download of ''Watch Dogs 2'' with the purchase of their [[solid-state disk]]s or curved gaming monitors.<ref name=\"curved purchase\" /> [[Amazon.com|Amazon Prime]] copies were subject to an early release, which revealed issues with the seamless multiplayer. Ubisoft vowed to repair the feature on schedule<ref name=\"seamless release\" /> but on the day of release, the company said it was broken \u2013 citing persistent [[lag]]ging and [[Crash (computing)|crashing]].<ref name=\"crash lagging\" /> Cooperative multiplayer was enabled a week after the game's release.<ref name=\"cooperative problems\" /> A free trial lasting three hours was released for PlayStation 4 on January 17, 2017; the Xbox One version was downloadable on January 24.<ref name=\"free three\" />\n\nPre-ordering \"The Gold Edition Collector's Edition\" included additional content such as weapon skins, vehicles and drones; the \"Deluxe Collector's Edition\" contains the same, but excluded the [[Season pass (video gaming)|season pass]]. Each of these, as well as the generic \"Collector's Edition\", contained a physical [[robot]] called \"Wrench Junior\", controlled by a [[mobile app]] on a [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer]]. The \"Gold Edition\" came with the same items and season pass, and while the \"Deluxe Edition\" omitted the inclusion of the season pass, it contained all other additions.<ref name=\"wrench junior\" /> The mission \"Zodiac Killer\" was also exclusive to pre-order purchases. It involves the protagonist Marcus Holloway in chasing a [[Copycat crime|copycat killer]] emulating the same [[modus operandi]] as the [[Zodiac Killer]].<ref name=\"zodiac senior\" /> Amazon and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch Prime]] members were privy to free content like [[Experience point|XP]] boosts and skin packs.<ref name=\"skin twitch\" /> \"ScoutXpedition\", a PlayStation 4 pre-order bonus mission, became free to download in January 2017.<ref name=\"ScoutXpedition\" />\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\nFive downloadable content (DLC) packs have been released: the \"T-Bone Content Bundle\", \"Human Conditions\", \"No Compromise\", \"Root Access Bundle\", and \"Psychedelic Pack\".<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" /> As per an exclusivity agreement with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]], all DLCs for ''Watch Dogs 2'' were timed exclusives for PlayStation 4.<ref name=\"polygon-ps4exclusive\" />\n* Root Access Bundle (available in December 2016)<ref name=\"access root\" /> and Psychedelic Pack (available on launch day) feature a Zodiac Killer mission as well as new outfits, cars, skins, and weapons.<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" />\n* The T-Bone Content Bundle was released for PlayStation 4 on December 22, 2016,<ref name=\"t-boned\" /> and includes a new co-op difficulty setting, \"Mayhem\", plus the clothes and truck of the original ''Watch Dogs'' character Raymond \"T-Bone\" Kenney.<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" />\n* Human Conditions was released on February 21, 2017 for the PlayStation 4 and on March 23 for the Xbox One and PC,<ref name=\"hum4nc0nd1t10n5\" /> and includes three new stories set in San Francisco's science and medicine industries. The pack also includes new co-op missions featuring a new enemy class called \"the Jammer\", a technologically savvy enemy capable of jamming all of a player's hacker equipment, making them vulnerable to head-on attacks.<ref name=\"t bone\" /><ref name=\"psychedelic root\" />\n* No Compromise was released on April 18, 2017 for PlayStation 4 and was launched on 18 May for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, featuring a new story mission, outfits and weapons.<ref name=\"no compromise\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 75/100<ref name=\"MC-PC\" /><br>(PS4) 82/100<ref name=\"MC-PS4\" /><br>(XONE) 81/100<ref name=\"MC-XONE\" />\n| Destruct = 8.5/10<ref name=\"Destruct\" />\n| EGM = 8/10<ref name=\"EGM\" />\n| GI = 7.75/10<ref name=\"GI\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GameRev\" />\n| IGN = 8.5/10<ref name=\"IGNpage2\" />\n| Poly = 8/10<ref name=\"Poly\" />\n| VG = 8/10<ref name=\"VG\" />\n}}\n\n''Watch Dogs 2'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MC-PC\" /><ref name=\"MC-PS4\" /><ref name=\"MC-XONE\" /> Technical issues on consoles were fixed with the Update 1.04 [[Patch (computing)|patch]].<ref name=\"fixed patch\" /> In his review, ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Zack Furniss praised the sequel's tonal shift to a lack of seriousness and stated that its protagonist Marcus Holloway boasted a similar charm and wit. He thought well of the hacking component as it was suggestible to multiple fields of use, and enjoyed its nature of compatibility with a non-lethal approach; in fact, Furniss felt that for this reason firearms could have been excluded entirely. The driving was lauded as an improvement from the first game, yet technical issues like [[glitch]]es and low [[frame rate]]s were cited as shortcomings.<ref name=\"Destruct\" /> To Matt Buchholtz, writing for ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]'', the game signified \"less a hacktivist tale and more a beautiful immersion into the San Francisco Bay\". The setting, characters and story were cited as considerable refinements from its predecessor. Buchholtz discerned that the tasks demanded to gain followers were successful in encouraging world exploration. He noted however that \u2013 in context of the main character \u2013 murder made little sense, which led to increased usage of stealth.<ref name=\"EGM\" /> Elise Favis at ''[[Game Informer]]'' both disparaged and praised elements in comparison to those of ''Watch Dogs''. She enjoyed that hacking was prioritized in the gameplay and the new \"smoother\" driving mechanic, but saw inconsistencies in the protagonist's actions versus his personality and thought supporting characters \"too obnoxious and petty to be meaningful companions\". Favis also experienced low frame rate capabilities on PlayStation 4.<ref name=\"GI\" />\n\nAron Garst of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' stated that ''Watch Dogs 2'' had redressed \"nearly every negative aspect of the original\", and as such, marked a favorable change in the franchise.<ref name=\"GameRev\" /> ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Dan Stapleton liked Marcus Holloway more than Aiden Pearce of the first game, and similarly appreciated the supporting characters of DedSec. Marcus' penchant for moral integrity was a noticeable contradiction for Stapleton, though, in light of the prospect to have him kill innocent people if one so chooses. Therefore, the character's personality was observed as the only preclusion to violence and an axiomatic push toward the stealth approach, which Stapleton insisted was the most accommodating of available tools.<ref name=\"IGNpage1\" /> Writing for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Philip Kollar saw that ''Watch Dogs 2'' could appeal to those able to connect with \"being young, angry at the system and certain that you know what's best for the world\". Its [[tongue-in-cheek]] demeanor was said to naturally coincide with the hacker culture and [[open world]] genre. [[San Francisco]] \u2013 the spaces of which were described as \"cleverly designed\" \u2013 never felt overwhelming in size to Kollar but inspired joy as he took advantage of the immediate ability to explore it entirely. His complaints concerned firearms; their use was considered \"a complete failure of imagination\" and unbelievable from the members of DedSec \u2014 \"an [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]-esque group of peaceful hacktivists\".<ref name=\"Poly\" /> Alice Bell of ''VideoGamer.com'' wrote in her verdict, \"''Watch Dogs 2'' is missing a bit of refinement, and has had issues with multiplayer, but joining DedSec is still a riot and a half. It's high energy fun with engaging characters, and you can make an entire city your playground\".<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n=== Sales ===\nIn November 2016, Ubisoft revealed that the game's pre-orders were disappointing for the company. Due to this, Ubisoft took a more conservative approach and reduced the sales projection for the second half of its fiscal year 2017. However, CEO Yves Guillemot was confident that the game would not be a commercial failure, and compared the game to ''[[Far Cry 3]]'', a commercially successful game with low pre-order sales. He believed that reviews would have a great impact to the game sales due to consumers' \"wait-and-see\" approach.<ref name=\"IGN-Nov2016\" /><ref name=\"wait-and-see\" /> ''Watch Dogs 2'' was the second-best-selling retail video game in the United Kingdom in its week of release, according to [[Chart-Track]], an eighty percent decrease from the sales of the original.<ref name=\"chart-track\" /><ref name=\"eighty percent\" /> In the United States, the game ranked number eight in sales in January 2017.<ref name=\"moj\" /> The PlayStation 4 version sold 68,796 copies in Japan.<ref name=\"Siliconera-Dec2016\" />\n\n== Sequel ==\nA sequel, ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]'', was teased by [[Ubisoft]] via [[Twitter]] a week before the official announcement at [[E3 2019]],<ref
