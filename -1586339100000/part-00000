Survival Mode allows the player to play as Nethers from Social Autopsy in a challenge to regain health by defeating enemies and absorbing their lifeforce. Music Video Mode is a modified version of Story Mode that plays exactly like the Music Video with shorter levels, fewer enemies and a new move set for the Faderhead character. Revenge Mode gives access to the boss characters in a reversal of Story Mode where you must stop Faderhead from playing his concert. Playable bosses include Andy from [[Combichrist]], Steve from [[And One]], Chris from [[Blutengel]], Graves from [[Aesthetic Perfection]] and Brian from [[The Gothsicles]]. Another new mode was also added, called Tournament Mode, which allows two to four players to compete against each other in a versus/fighting style of gameplay using all the playable characters from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facebook.com/FaderheadGame |title=Faderhead 2.0 |publisher=facebook.com/FaderheadGame |date= |accessdate=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n* 2006: ''[[FH1]]'' (Accession Records)\n* 2007: ''[[FH2]]'' (Accession Records)\n* 2008: ''[[FH3]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2010: ''[[Black Friday (Faderhead album)|Black Friday]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2012: ''[[The World of Faderhead]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2013: ''FH4'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2014: ''Atoms & Emptiness'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2016: ''FH-X'' (Not A Robot Records)\n* 2017: ''Night Physics''\n* 2019: ''Asteria''\n\n===Compilation albums===\n* 2010: ''[[Faderhead Trilogy|Trilogy]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2012: ''Two Sides To Every Story'' (2CD) (L-Tracks Recordings)\n\n===EPs===\n* 2009: ''[[Horizon Born]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2011: ''The Way to Fuck Clubs'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2013: ''Empires of the Northern Lights v2.42'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2015: ''The Tokyo Tapes'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2016: ''Anima In Machina'' (Not A Robot Records)\n* 2017: ''No Signal'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2019: ''Starchaser''\n\n===Singles===\n* 2004: \"The Protagonist\"\n* 2006: \"OH Scavenger vs. the Protagonist\"\n* 2006: \"Bassgod\"\n* 2008: \"Exit Ghost\"\n* 2010: \"69 Freaks Per Minute\"\n* 2013: \"Artificial Bullshit (Demo)\"\n* 2017: \"Know Your Darkness\"\n\n===Music videos===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNNLzpCaymI/ Girly Show]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4GIZGoUyx4/ Exit Ghost]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLptcBLy6Qw/ Tanz Zwo Drei Vier]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG7P6NX8yyE/ Dirtygrrrls/Dirtybois (ft.

The new release addressed bugs, balance issues, and animation problems. All new content was also added including new modes, playable characters and the ability to play the game with two players. Survival Mode allows the player to play as Nethers from Social Autopsy in a challenge to regain health by defeating enemies and absorbing their lifeforce. Music Video Mode is a modified version of Story Mode that plays exactly like the Music Video with shorter levels, fewer enemies and a new move set for the Faderhead character. Revenge Mode gives access to the boss characters in a reversal of Story Mode where you must stop Faderhead from playing his concert. Playable bosses include Andy from [[Combichrist]], Steve from [[And One]], Chris from [[Blutengel]], Graves from [[Aesthetic Perfection]] and Brian from [[The Gothsicles]]. Another new mode was also added, called Tournament Mode, which allows two to four players to compete against each other in a versus/fighting style of gameplay using all the playable characters from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://facebook.com/FaderheadGame |title=Faderhead 2.0 |publisher=facebook.com/FaderheadGame |date= |accessdate=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n* 2006: ''[[FH1]]'' (Accession Records)\n* 2007: ''[[FH2]]'' (Accession Records)\n* 2008: ''[[FH3]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2010: ''[[Black Friday (Faderhead album)|Black Friday]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2012: ''[[The World of Faderhead]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2013: ''FH4'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2014: ''Atoms & Emptiness'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2016: ''FH-X'' (Not A Robot Records)\n* 2017: ''Night Physics''\n* 2019: ''Asteria''\n\n===Compilation albums===\n* 2010: ''[[Faderhead Trilogy|Trilogy]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2012: ''Two Sides To Every Story'' (2CD) (L-Tracks Recordings)\n\n===EPs===\n* 2009: ''[[Horizon Born]]'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2011: ''The Way to Fuck Clubs'' (L-Tracks Recordings)\n* 2013: ''Empires of the Northern Lights v2.42'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2015: ''The Tokyo Tapes'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2016: ''Anima In Machina'' (Not A Robot Records)\n* 2017: ''No Signal'' (Bandcamp)\n* 2019: ''Starchaser''\n\n===Singles===\n* 2004: \"The Protagonist\"\n* 2006: \"OH Scavenger vs. the Protagonist\"\n* 2006: \"Bassgod\"\n* 2008: \"Exit Ghost\"\n* 2010: \"69 Freaks Per Minute\"\n* 2013: \"Artificial Bullshit (Demo)\"\n* 2017: \"Know Your Darkness\"\n\n===Music videos===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNNLzpCaymI/ Girly Show]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4GIZGoUyx4/ Exit Ghost]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLptcBLy6Qw/ Tanz Zwo Drei Vier]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG7P6NX8yyE/ Dirtygrrrls/Dirtybois (ft.

{"title_page": "Blowback (firearms)", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2014}}\n'''Blowback''' is a system of operation for [[Semi-automatic firearm|self-loading]] [[firearm]]s that obtains energy from the motion of the [[cartridge case]] as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gas created by the ignition of the [[propellant charge]].<ref name=\"Chinn\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=3}}</ref>\n\nSeveral blowback systems exist within this broad principle of operation, each distinguished by the methods used to control [[bolt (firearms)|bolt]] movement.  In most actions that use blowback operation, the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delay opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel.<ref>Walter H. B. Smith, ''Rifles'', Military Service Publishing Co., 1948,  \"blowback semiautomatic operation\" pp.88-89.</ref>  A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.\n\nThe blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> Other operating principles for self-loading firearms include [[blow forward]], [[Gas-operated reloading|gas operation]], and [[recoil operation]].\n\n==Principle of operation==\nThe blowback system is generally defined as an operating system in which energy to operate the firearm's various mechanisms and provide automation is derived from the movement of the spent cartridge case pushed out of the chamber by rapidly expanding powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=11}}</ref> This rearward thrust, imparted against the breech, is a direct result of the expansion of propellant gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> Certain guns will use energy from blowback to perform the entire operating cycle (these are typically designs using relatively \"low pressure\" ammunition) while others will use a portion of the blowback to operate only certain parts of the cycle or simply use the blowback energy to enhance the operational energy from another system of automatic operation.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/>\n\nWhat is common to all blowback systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears in the form of kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: '''simple blowback''' (often just \"blowback\"), '''delayed/retarded blowback''', and '''advanced primer ignition.'''\n\nRelating blowback to other types of automatic firearm operation, [[George M. Chinn]] wrote that: \"In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of gas operation. This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of as a sort of piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of [[gas operation]] or [[recoil operation]] is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one.\"<ref name=\"Chinn\"/>\n\n==Simple blowback==\n[[File:Firearm simple blowback animation.gif|thumb|right|221px|Animation of simple blowback operation]]\n[[File:Hammerless380.jpg|thumb|right|The [[.380 ACP]] [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]] uses simple blowback. The mass of the [[Pistol slide|slide]] is enough to delay opening of the chamber until pressure has dropped.]]\n\nThe blowback (sometimes referred to as \"simple\", \"straight\" or \"pure\" blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type.  In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against the rear of the barrel, but is not locked in place.  At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel while at the same time pushing the case rearward against the bolt.  The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring.  The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that the bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber.  The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear.  The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon [[Open bolt|fires from an open bolt]]).  A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.\n\nThe blowback system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets.  Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts to keep the breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical.  For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel during the first few milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the return spring is limited to {{convert|60|lbf|N}} or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the return spring is not powerful enough to keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in the bolt to cycle the weapon.<ref>{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|pp=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\nDue to the required bolt weight, blowback designs in pistols are generally limited to calibers smaller than [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (e.g., [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.380 ACP]], [[9\u00d718mm Makarov]], etc.) There are exceptions such as the simple blowback pistols from [[Hi-Point Firearms]] which include models chambered in [[.45 ACP]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.380 ACP]] and [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |title=Hi-Point Firearms: Handguns |work=Hi-Point Firearms |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165408/http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> Simple blowback operation can also be found in small-bore (such as [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]]) semi-automatic [[rifle]]s, [[carbine]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.  Most simple blowback rifles are chambered for the [[.22 Long Rifle]] cartridge. Popular examples include the [[Marlin Model 60]] and the [[Ruger 10/22]]. Most blowback carbines and submachine guns are chambered for pistol cartridges such as the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. Examples include the [[MP 40]], [[Sten]] and [[UZI]].  The bolt can be made bigger and more massive in these weapons than in handguns, as they are intrinsically heavier and designed, ideally at least, to be fired with both hands, often with the aid of a shoulder stock; and these factors help to ameliorate the disruption to the shooter's aim caused by the heavy bolt's movement. Consequently, simple blowback is adequate for somewhat more powerful rounds in submachine guns than in standard pistols. There were also a few rifles that chambered cartridges specifically designed for blowback operation. Examples include the [[Winchester Model 1905]], [[Winchester Model 1907|1907]] and [[Winchester Model 1910|1910]]. The only known assault rifle to use simple blowback was the Burton Model 1917.<ref>The World's Assault Rifles By Gary Paul Johnston, Thomas B. Nelson. Chapter 2: Assault Rifle Operating and Locking Systems.</ref>\n\nWhereas simple blowback is limited to guns using low-power rounds, it is so efficient in this context that in small-calibre [[semi-automatic pistols]] it is by now almost ubiquitous.  Heavier calibre semiautomatic handguns typically employ a [[Recoil operation|short recoil system]], of which by far the most common type are [[John Browning#Products|Browning]]-derived designs which rely on a locking barrel and [[Pistol slide|slide]] assembly instead of blowback. But blowback guns can be used to fire powerful cartridges if they are of the other two types already mentioned: API or delayed blowback.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback==\n{{stack\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle AB.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part I)]]\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle CD.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part II)]]\n}}\nIn the API blowback design, the primer is ignited when the bolt is still moving forward and before the cartridge is fully chambered. This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile weight, propellant charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static [[inertia]] to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first have to do the work of overcoming forward [[momentum]] to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved.<ref name=\"Chinn_31\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=31}}</ref> Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.\n\nAccording to Anthony G. Williams, the \"API blowback principle is used virtually in all [[open bolt]] [[sub-machine gun]]s\" (technically, although generally these are known as \"simple blowback\" weapons due to the very late ignition of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although \"the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and [[rebated-rim cartridge]]s are not required\" for sub-machine guns.<ref name=\"Williams_65\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, page 65</ref> In heavier weapons, advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html Williams, Anthony G., ''Of Oerlikons and other things\u2026\u2026''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110002552/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html |date=2014-11-10 }} www.quarry.nildram.co.uk article</ref> for use on the [[Becker Type M2 20 mm cannon]]. It became a feature of a wide range of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.<ref name=\"Williams_65\"/>\n\nTo increase performance of API blowback firearms,<ref name=\"Chinn_31\"/> larger calibre APIB guns such as the Becker and Oerlikon use extended chambers, longer than is necessary to contain the round, and ammunition for APIB firearms come with straight-sided cartridges with [[Rim (firearms)#Rebated rim|rebated rims]] (rims that are smaller in diameter than the cartridge itself).<ref name=\"Williams_63\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 63-68</ref> The last part of forward motion and the first part of the rearward motion of the case and bolt happen within the confines of this extended chamber. As long as the gas pressure in the barrel is high, the walls of the case remain supported and the breach sealed, although the case is sliding rearwards. This sliding motion of the case, while it is expanded by a high internal gas pressure, risks tearing it apart, and a common solution is to grease the ammunition to reduce the friction. The case needs to have a rebated rim because the front end of the bolt will enter the chamber, and the extractor claw hooked over the rim therefore has to fit also within the diameter of the chamber. The case generally has very little neck, because this remains unsupported during the firing cycle and is generally deformed; a strongly necked case would be likely to split.\n\nThe API blowback design permits the use of more powerful ammunition in a lighter gun than would be achieved by using simple blowback, and the reduction of felt recoil results in further weight savings. The original Becker cannon, firing 20\u00d770mmRB ammunition, was developed to be carried by World War I aircraft, and weighed only 30&nbsp;kg.<ref name=\"Williams_89\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Flying Gun World War I'', Airlife UK 2003, pages 89-90</ref> Oerlikon even produced an anti-tank rifle firing 20\u00d7110mmRB ammunition using the API blowback operation, the [[Oerlikon SSG36|SSG36]]. On the other hand, because the design imposes a very close relationship between bolt mass, chamber length, spring strength, ammunition power and rate of fire, in APIB guns high rate of fire and high muzzle velocity tend to be mutually exclusive.<ref name=\"Williams_63\"/> API blowback guns also have to fire from an open bolt, which is not conducive to accuracy and also prevents [[synchronization gear|synchronized]] fire through an aircraft propeller arc.\n\nAccording to a [[United States Army Materiel Command]] engineering course from 1970, \"The advanced primer ignition gun is superior to the simple blowback because of its higher firing rate and lower recoil momentum. However, favorable performance depends on timing that must be precise. A slight delay in primer function, and the gun reverts to a simple blowback without the benefit of a massive bolt and stiffer driving spring to soften the recoil impact. [...] The exacting requirements in design and construction of gun and ammunition reduce this type almost to the point of academic interest only.\"<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 Automatic Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801182437/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 |date=2013-08-01 }}, [[United States Army Materiel Command|AMC]] pamphlet no. 706-260, February 1970, page 2{{hyphen}}47<!-- this not a page range, but a single page number --></ref>\n\nAPI mechanisms are very sensitive to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their [[MG FF]] (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter [[Minengescho\u00df]] shell, they had to rebalance the spring strength and bolt weight of the gun, resulting in a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models.<ref name=\"Williams_166\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 65 and 166</ref> The 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 108 cannon]] was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.\n\nAn example of API in sub-machine guns is the L2A3 [[Sterling submachine gun]], where the maximum chamber pressure is achieved while the breechblock is still moving forward and is about 0.46&nbsp;mm away from the rear face of the chamber.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\">{{cite book|author=Charles Q.

As with the resistance provided by momentum in API, it takes a fraction of a second for the propellant gases to overcome this and start moving cartridge and bolt backwards; this very brief delay is sufficient for the bullet to leave the muzzle and for the internal pressure in the barrel to decrease to a safe level.  The bolt and cartridge are then pushed to the rear by the residual gas pressure.   \n\nBecause of high pressures, rifle-caliber delayed blowback firearms, such as the [[FAMAS]] and [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], typically have fluted chambers to ease extraction. Below are various forms of delayed-blowback actions:\n\n===Roller-delayed===\n[[File:Roller delayed blowback action.svg|thumb|right|Roller-delayed blowback-operated breech for automatic weapons]]\n[[File:G3 Bolt.PNG|thumb|upright|A schematic of the G3 roller-delayed blowback mechanism]]\n[[File:DCB Shooting G3 Roller system3.JPG|thumb|upright|Cutaway model of the chamber with gas relief flutes (left) and roller-delayed action of the G3 assault rifle]]\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|right|A schematic of the roller-delayed blowback mechanism used in the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]]. This system had its origins in the late-war [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototype.]]\n\nRoller-delayed blowback was first used in [[Mauser]]'s [[StG 45(M)|Ger\u00e4t 06H]] prototype. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from [[Roller locked|roller-locked]] [[recoil operation]] as seen in the [[MG 42]] and gas operated roller locked, as seen in the Ger\u00e4t 06.<ref>{{Citation|last=Forgotten Weapons|title=Last Ditch Innovation: The Development of the Gerat 06 and Gerat 06H Rifles|date=2012-11-19|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WEPwmYcCPFs|accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref> Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil, and unlike the StG 44, roller-delayed blowback systems lack a gas piston. These omissions are conducive to relatively light construction by significantly reducing the number of parts required and the amount of machining required to reduce a rifle. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers on the sides of the bolt are driven inward against a tapered bolt carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.<ref>Stevens, R. Blake, ''Full Circle: A Treatise on Roller Locking'', Collector Grade Publications (2006). {{ISBN|0-88935-400-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mausers Wilhelm St\u00e4hle and [[Ludwig Vorgrimler]]. Though appearing simple its development during World War II was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by [[Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer]], the director of [[Mauser|Mauser Werke's]] Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce as the bolt opened at an extreme velocity of approximately {{convert|20|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} during automatic fire. To counter bolt-bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found to significantly reduce the opening velocity of the bolt. The extremely high bolt carrier velocities problem was not solved by trial and error. Mathematician Dr. Karl Maier provided analysis of the components, assemblies in the development project.<ref>[https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/01/01/do-you-know-your-hks-parents/ Do You Know Your HK\u2019s Parents?]</ref> In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis reducing the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the bolt carrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear bolt carrier was forced to move 3 times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the bolt carrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the bolt carrier. Making the bolt carrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers [[StG 45(M)]] project Maier assumed a {{convert|120|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt head and {{convert|360|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt carrier (1 to 3 ratio). The prototype StG 45 (M) assault rifle had 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] wall to assist the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls during extraction. Fluting the end of the chamber provides pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior and thus ensures extraction without tearing the case making extraction easier and more reliable. In 1944 other German companies like Gro\u00dffu\u00df, Rheinmetall and Haenel showed interest in developing roller-delayed blowback small arms. Gro\u00dffu\u00df worked on a roller-delayed blowback [[MG 45]] general-purpose machine gun that, like the StG 45 (M), had not progressed beyond the prototype stage by the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II, former Mauser technicians Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L\u00f6ffler perfected the mechanism between 1946 and 1950 while working for the French small arms manufacturer [[Atelier M\u00e9canique de Mulhouse|Centre d'Etudes et d'Armament de Mulhouse]] (CEAM). In 1950 Ludwig Vorgrimler was recruited to work for [[CETME]] in Spain. The first full-scale production rifle to utilize roller-delay was the Spanish [[CETME rifle|CETME battle rifle]], which was closely followed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[SIG SG 510]] and the CETME Model B-based [[Heckler & Koch G3]]. The G3 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">Wo\u017aniak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej \u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141. Bellona. 2001. pp. 7\u201310.</ref> The G3's \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. Due to the relative low [[bolt thrust]] exhibited by pistol cartridges the anti-bounce mechanism is omitted by Heckler & Koch on their roller-delayed blowback firearms chambered for pistols cartridges. Heckler & Koch's [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]] is the most common weapon still in service worldwide using this system. The [[Heckler & Koch P9]] semi-automatic pistol, [[CETME Ameli]] light machine gun and [[Heckler & Koch HK21]] general-purpose machine gun also use it.\n\nRoller-delayed blowback arms are ammunition specific, since they lack an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the arm to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior. Their reliable functioning is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. At the moment of cartridge ignition the chamber has to be and remain sealed, until the bullet has exited the barrel and the gas pressure within the bore has dropped to a safe level before the seal is broken and chamber starts to open. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms manufactures offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles and cylindrical rollers with different diameters. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and gas pressure drop management as the locking piece acts in unison with the bolt head carrier. The bolt gap width determines the [[Headspace (firearms)|headspace]] and hence the correct positioning of the cartridges in the (closed) chamber. Do to usage wear the bolt gap between the locking piece and bolt head carrier is expected to gradully increase. It can be determined and checked by a [[feeler gauge]] measurement and can be altered by changing the cylindrical rollers for rollers with a different diameter. Installing larger diameter rollers will increase the bolt gap and push the locking piece forward. Installing smaller diameter rollers results in the reverse effects.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\n\n===Lever-delayed===\n[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]\nLever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to put the bolt at a mechanical disadvantage, delaying the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. [[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]] patented the first known design for a lever-delay system.<ref>{{US Patent|1410270}}</ref> The mechanism was adapted by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] arms designer [[P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly]] in the 1930s and used in the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 39M and 43M]] submachine guns for the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]]. After the [[World War II]], Kir\u00e1ly settled in the [[Dominican Republic]] and developed the [[Crist\u00f3bal Carbine]]  (or Kir\u00e1ly-Crist\u00f3bal Carbine).

The [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding [[propellant]] gases, as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It was used by some World War II German designs for the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge, including the [[Volkssturmgewehr]] rifle (with little effectiveness) and the [[Grossfuss Sturmgewehr]] (with slightly more efficiency),<ref name=\"kalash\">{{citation |first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 |last=\u041f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u0451\u0432 |url=http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/44a/020_026.pdf |script-title=ru:\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f: \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430 |trans-title=History: a little-known weapon of World War II: Horn Assault Rifle |language=Russian |journal=\u041a\u0410\u041b\u0410\u0428\u041d\u0418\u041a\u041e\u0412. \u041e\u0420\u0423\u0416\u0418\u0415, \u0411\u041e\u0415\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041f\u0410\u0421\u042b, \u0421\u041d\u0410\u0420\u042f\u0416\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 (Kalasnikov: Weapons, ammunition, equipment) |date=September 2006 |pages=20\u201326 |access-date=2013-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408222103/http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/44a/020_026.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> and after the war by the [[Heckler & Koch P7]], [[Walther CCP]], [[Steyr GB]] and [[Type 77 pistol#M-77B|M-77B]] pistols.\n\n===Chamber-ring delayed===\nWhen a cartridge is fired, the case expands to seal the sides of the chamber. This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081723/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |archive-date=2017-04-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143534/https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Other firearms that used this system were the LWS [[Seecamp]] pistol, the AMT Automag II, and the Kimball .30 Carbine pistol.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228090142/http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214242/http://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |archive-date=2018-03-13 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143444/https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The [[SIG SG 510]] rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder which is used to avoid bolt-bounce rather than a delay element.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404152628/http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |archive-date=2017-04-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Hesitation locked===\n[[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]]'s patented system incorporates a breech block independent of the slide or bolt carrier. When in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder located in the frame of the firearm. When the cartridge is fired, the cartridge case, bolt and slide move together a short distance until the breech block strikes the locking shoulder and stops. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase while the breech remains locked. This allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels once the bullet departs the barrel.

His system used a small \"piston\" that incorporates the chamber.  When the cartridge is fired, the front of the floating chamber is thrust back by gas pressure impinging on the front of the chamber as in a traditional piston.  This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone.  Often described as \"accelerated blowback\", this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the .22 Rimfire cartridge.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_50/ai_112646118 |title=Charles E.

Known prototypes using this method of operation include two 1936 rifle designs, one by Mihail Mamontov and another by Makar Goryainov at [[TsKB-14]], and [[Baryshev AVB-7.62|a 1980s design by A.F. Barishev]]. The Mamontov and Goryainov rifles are only partially automatic; only the bolt unlocking is powered by the gases pushing the cartridge back, while the rest of the cycle (ejection, reloading) is done manually as in a traditional bolt-action rifle. A major problem with using the case cartridge as piston is that its motion is much faster (about 1 ms) compared to tapping gas further down the bore through a piston\u2014about 5 ms in the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], which used the same cartridge as Mamontov's rifle. Barishev made a fully automatic, but rather bulky mechanism that used a mechanical delay. In his system, the case cartridge pushed back a tilting bolt face, that upon reaching a certain angle pushes backwards an unlocking lever that continues farther before unlocking the bolt. The [[GRAU]] however still gave a negative evaluation of Barishev's gun, pointing out that the main problems with reliability of firearms using the cartridge case as a piston were known since the 1930s and still unsolved.<ref>\u0420. \u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043a, [http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf \u0413\u0418\u041b\u042c\u0417\u041e\u0412\u042b\u0419 \u0414\u0412\u0418\u0413\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c. \u041e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011523/http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf |date=May 13, 2014 }}, ''Kalashnikov'' magazine 2012/11, pp. 72-77</ref>\n\n==Limited-utility designs==\n===Blish lock===\n{{main article|Blish lock}}\nThe Blish Lock is a breech locking mechanism designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement with a force greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is called static friction, or ''[[stiction]]''. His locking mechanism was used in the [[Thompson submachine gun]], [[Thompson Autorifle|Autorifle]] and [[Thompson Light Rifle|Autocarbine]] designs.

In most actions that use blowback operation, the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delay opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel.<ref>Walter H. B. Smith, ''Rifles'', Military Service Publishing Co., 1948,  \"blowback semiautomatic operation\" pp.88-89.</ref>  A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.\n\nThe blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> Other operating principles for self-loading firearms include [[blow forward]], [[Gas-operated reloading|gas operation]], and [[recoil operation]].\n\n==Principle of operation==\nThe blowback system is generally defined as an operating system in which energy to operate the firearm's various mechanisms and provide automation is derived from the movement of the spent cartridge case pushed out of the chamber by rapidly expanding powder gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=11}}</ref> This rearward thrust, imparted against the breech, is a direct result of the expansion of propellant gases.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> Certain guns will use energy from blowback to perform the entire operating cycle (these are typically designs using relatively \"low pressure\" ammunition) while others will use a portion of the blowback to operate only certain parts of the cycle or simply use the blowback energy to enhance the operational energy from another system of automatic operation.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/>\n\nWhat is common to all blowback systems is that the cartridge case must move under the direct action of the powder pressure, therefore any gun in which the bolt is not rigidly locked and permitted to move while there remains powder pressure in the chamber will undergo a degree of blowback action.<ref name=\"Chinn_11\"/> The energy from the expansion of gases on firing appears in the form of kinetic energy transmitted to the bolt mechanism, which is controlled and used to operate the firearm's operation cycle. The extent to which blowback is employed largely depends on the manner used to control the movement of the bolt and the proportion of energy drawn from other systems of operation.<ref name=\"Chinn\"/> How the movement of the bolt is controlled is where blowback systems differ. Blowback operation is most often divided into three categories, all using residual pressure to complete the cycle of operation: '''simple blowback''' (often just \"blowback\"), '''delayed/retarded blowback''', and '''advanced primer ignition.'''\n\nRelating blowback to other types of automatic firearm operation, [[George M. Chinn]] wrote that: \"In the larger sense, blowback might well be considered a special form of gas operation. This is reasonable because the cartridge case may be conceived of as a sort of piston driven by the powder gases. Actually, blowback involves so many special problems that it is best considered to be in a class by itself. The question whether or not it should be included within the more general class of [[gas operation]] or [[recoil operation]] is purely academic. The important point is that it partakes some of the properties of both classes and, depending on the particular problem at hand, may be considered to be either one.\"<ref name=\"Chinn\"/>\n\n==Simple blowback==\n[[File:Firearm simple blowback animation.gif|thumb|right|221px|Animation of simple blowback operation]]\n[[File:Hammerless380.jpg|thumb|right|The [[.380 ACP]] [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]] uses simple blowback. The mass of the [[Pistol slide|slide]] is enough to delay opening of the chamber until pressure has dropped.]]\n\nThe blowback (sometimes referred to as \"simple\", \"straight\" or \"pure\" blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type.  In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against the rear of the barrel, but is not locked in place.  At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel while at the same time pushing the case rearward against the bolt.  The expanding gases push the bolt assembly to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring.  The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that the bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber.  The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear.  The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon [[Open bolt|fires from an open bolt]]).  A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.\n\nThe blowback system is practical for firearms using relatively low-power cartridges with lighter weight bullets.  Higher power cartridges require heavier bolts to keep the breech from opening prematurely; at some point, the bolt becomes too heavy to be practical.  For an extreme example, a 20mm cannon using simple blowback and lubricated cartridges would need a {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on}} bolt to keep the cartridge safely in the barrel during the first few milliseconds; furthermore, the average force supplied by the return spring is limited to {{convert|60|lbf|N}} or the bolt will not travel back far enough to feed a new round. Consequently, the return spring is not powerful enough to keep the bolt closed when the gun is tilted up. In addition, there is not enough energy stored in the bolt to cycle the weapon.<ref>{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|pp=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\nDue to the required bolt weight, blowback designs in pistols are generally limited to calibers smaller than [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (e.g., [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]], [[.380 ACP]], [[9\u00d718mm Makarov]], etc.) There are exceptions such as the simple blowback pistols from [[Hi-Point Firearms]] which include models chambered in [[.45 ACP]], [[.40 S&W]], [[.380 ACP]] and [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |title=Hi-Point Firearms: Handguns |work=Hi-Point Firearms |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711165408/http://www.hi-pointfirearms.com/handguns/hi_point_handguns.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> Simple blowback operation can also be found in small-bore (such as [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]]) semi-automatic [[rifle]]s, [[carbine]]s and [[submachine gun]]s.

The bolt can be made bigger and more massive in these weapons than in handguns, as they are intrinsically heavier and designed, ideally at least, to be fired with both hands, often with the aid of a shoulder stock; and these factors help to ameliorate the disruption to the shooter's aim caused by the heavy bolt's movement. Consequently, simple blowback is adequate for somewhat more powerful rounds in submachine guns than in standard pistols. There were also a few rifles that chambered cartridges specifically designed for blowback operation. Examples include the [[Winchester Model 1905]], [[Winchester Model 1907|1907]] and [[Winchester Model 1910|1910]]. The only known assault rifle to use simple blowback was the Burton Model 1917.<ref>The World's Assault Rifles By Gary Paul Johnston, Thomas B. Nelson. Chapter 2: Assault Rifle Operating and Locking Systems.</ref>\n\nWhereas simple blowback is limited to guns using low-power rounds, it is so efficient in this context that in small-calibre [[semi-automatic pistols]] it is by now almost ubiquitous.  Heavier calibre models of handgun (other than [[revolvers]], obviously) characteristically employ a [[Recoil operation|short recoil system]], of which by far the most common type are [[John Browning#Products|Browning]]-derived designs which rely on a locking barrel and [[Pistol slide|slide]] assembly instead of blowback. But blowback guns can be used to fire powerful cartridges if they are of the other two types already mentioned: API or delayed/retarded blowback.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback==\n{{stack\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle AB.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part I)]]\n | [[File:MK108 bolt cycle CD.png|thumb|right|[[MK 108 cannon]] bolt cycle (part II)]]\n}}\nIn the API blowback design, the primer is ignited when the bolt is still moving forward and before the cartridge is fully chambered. This requires a very careful design to ensure the proper balance and equalization of forces between the projectile weight, propellant charge, barrel length, bolt weight, and return spring strength. In a simple blowback design, the propellant gases have to overcome static [[inertia]] to accelerate the bolt rearwards to open the breech. In an API blowback, they first have to do the work of overcoming forward [[momentum]] to arrest the forward motion of the bolt. Because the forward and rearward speeds of the bolt tend to be approximately the same, the API blowback allows the weight of the bolt to be halved.<ref name=\"Chinn_31\">{{harvnb|Chinn|1955|p=31}}</ref> Because the momentum of the two opposed bolt motions cancels out over time, the API blowback design results in reduced recoil.\n\nAccording to Anthony G. Williams, the \"API blowback principle is used virtually in all [[open bolt]] [[sub-machine gun]]s\" (technically, although generally these are known as \"simple blowback\" weapons due to the very late ignition of the cartridge compared to specially designed API blowback guns like the MK 108), although \"the relatively low pressures and velocities mean that extended chambers and [[rebated-rim cartridge]]s are not required\" for sub-machine guns.<ref name=\"Williams_65\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, page 65</ref> In heavier weapons, advanced primer ignition (API) was originally developed by Reinhold Becker<ref>[http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html Williams, Anthony G., ''Of Oerlikons and other things\u2026\u2026''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110002552/http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/apib.html |date=2014-11-10 }} www.quarry.nildram.co.uk article</ref> for use on the [[Becker Type M2 20 mm cannon]]. It became a feature of a wide range of designs that can be traced back to Becker's, including the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] cannon widely used as anti-aircraft weapons during World War II.<ref name=\"Williams_65\"/>\n\nTo increase performance of API blowback firearms,<ref name=\"Chinn_31\"/> larger calibre APIB guns such as the Becker and Oerlikon use extended chambers, longer than is necessary to contain the round, and ammunition for APIB firearms come with straight-sided cartridges with [[Rim (firearms)#Rebated rim|rebated rims]] (rims that are smaller in diameter than the cartridge itself).<ref name=\"Williams_63\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 63-68</ref> The last part of forward motion and the first part of the rearward motion of the case and bolt happen within the confines of this extended chamber. As long as the gas pressure in the barrel is high, the walls of the case remain supported and the breach sealed, although the case is sliding rearwards. This sliding motion of the case, while it is expanded by a high internal gas pressure, risks tearing it apart, and a common solution is to grease the ammunition to reduce the friction. The case needs to have a rebated rim because the front end of the bolt will enter the chamber, and the extractor claw hooked over the rim therefore has to fit also within the diameter of the chamber. The case generally has very little neck, because this remains unsupported during the firing cycle and is generally deformed; a strongly necked case would be likely to split.\n\nThe API blowback design permits the use of more powerful ammunition in a lighter gun than would be achieved by using simple blowback, and the reduction of felt recoil results in further weight savings. The original Becker cannon, firing 20\u00d770mmRB ammunition, was developed to be carried by World War I aircraft, and weighed only 30&nbsp;kg.<ref name=\"Williams_89\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Flying Gun World War I'', Airlife UK 2003, pages 89-90</ref> Oerlikon even produced an anti-tank rifle firing 20\u00d7110mmRB ammunition using the API blowback operation, the [[Oerlikon SSG36|SSG36]]. On the other hand, because the design imposes a very close relationship between bolt mass, chamber length, spring strength, ammunition power and rate of fire, in APIB guns high rate of fire and high muzzle velocity tend to be mutually exclusive.<ref name=\"Williams_63\"/> API blowback guns also have to fire from an open bolt, which is not conducive to accuracy and also prevents [[synchronization gear|synchronized]] fire through an aircraft propeller arc.\n\nAccording to a [[United States Army Materiel Command]] engineering course from 1970, \"The advanced primer ignition gun is superior to the simple blowback because of its higher firing rate and lower recoil momentum. However, favorable performance depends on timing that must be precise. A slight delay in primer function, and the gun reverts to a simple blowback without the benefit of a massive bolt and stiffer driving spring to soften the recoil impact. [...] The exacting requirements in design and construction of gun and ammunition reduce this type almost to the point of academic interest only.\"<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 Automatic Weapons] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801182437/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0868578 |date=2013-08-01 }}, [[United States Army Materiel Command|AMC]] pamphlet no. 706-260, February 1970, page 2{{hyphen}}47<!-- this not a page range, but a single page number --></ref>\n\nAPI mechanisms are very sensitive to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their [[MG FF]] (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter [[Minengescho\u00df]] shell, they had to rebalance the spring strength and bolt weight of the gun, resulting in a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models.<ref name=\"Williams_166\">Anthony G. Williams, ''Rapid Fire'', Airlife UK 2000, pages 65 and 166</ref> The 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 108 cannon]] was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.\n\nAn example of API in sub-machine guns is the L2A3 [[Sterling submachine gun]], where the maximum chamber pressure is achieved while the breechblock is still moving forward and is about 0.46&nbsp;mm away from the rear face of the chamber.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\">{{cite book|author=Charles Q.

As with the resistance provided by momentum in API, it takes a fraction of a second for the propellant gases to overcome this and start moving cartridge and bolt backwards; this very brief delay is sufficient for the bullet to leave the muzzle and for the internal pressure in the barrel to decrease to a safe level.  The bolt and cartridge are then pushed to the rear by the residual gas pressure.   \n\nBecause of high pressures, rifle-caliber delayed blowback firearms, such as the [[FAMAS]] and [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]], typically have fluted chambers to ease extraction. Below are various forms of delayed-blowback actions:\n\n===Roller-delayed===\n[[File:Roller delayed blowback action.svg|thumb|right|Roller-delayed blowback-operated breech for automatic weapons]]\n[[File:G3 Bolt.PNG|thumb|upright|A schematic of the G3 roller-delayed blowback mechanism]]\n[[File:DCB Shooting G3 Roller system3.JPG|thumb|upright|Cutaway model of the chamber with gas relief flutes (left) and roller-delayed action of the G3 assault rifle]]\n[[File:US Patent 3283435 8-Nov-1966 BREECH CLOSURE Theodor Koch.png|thumb|right|A schematic of the roller-delayed blowback mechanism used in the [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]]. This system had its origins in the late-war [[StG 45(M)]] [[assault rifle]] prototype.]]\n\nRoller-delayed blowback was first used in [[Mauser]]'s [[StG 45(M)|Ger\u00e4t 06H]] prototype. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from [[Roller locked|roller-locked]] [[recoil operation]] as seen in the [[MG 42]] and gas operated roller locked, as seen in the Ger\u00e4t 06.<ref>{{Citation|last=Forgotten Weapons|title=Last Ditch Innovation: The Development of the Gerat 06 and Gerat 06H Rifles|date=2012-11-19|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WEPwmYcCPFs|accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref> Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil, and unlike the StG 44, roller-delayed blowback systems lack a gas piston. These omissions are conducive to relatively light construction by significantly reducing the number of parts required and the amount of machining required to reduce a rifle. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers on the sides of the bolt are driven inward against a tapered bolt carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.<ref>Stevens, R. Blake, ''Full Circle: A Treatise on Roller Locking'', Collector Grade Publications (2006). {{ISBN|0-88935-400-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe roller-delayed blowback firearm action was patented by Mausers Wilhelm St\u00e4hle and [[Ludwig Vorgrimler]]. Though appearing simple its development during World War II was a hard technical and personal effort, as German engineering, mathematical and other scientists had to work together on a like-it-or-not basis led by [[Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer]], the director of [[Mauser|Mauser Werke's]] Weapons Research Institute and Weapons Development Group. Experiments showed roller-delayed blowback firearms exhibited bolt-bounce as the bolt opened at an extreme velocity of approximately {{convert|20|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} during automatic fire. To counter bolt-bounce the perfect angle choice on the nose of the bolt head had to be found to significantly reduce the opening velocity of the bolt. The extremely high bolt carrier velocities problem was not solved by trial and error. Mathematician Dr. Karl Maier provided analysis of the components, assemblies in the development project.<ref>[https://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/01/01/do-you-know-your-hks-parents/ Do You Know Your HK\u2019s Parents?]</ref> In December 1943 Maier came up with an equation that engineers used to change the angles in the receiver to 45\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 on the locking piece relative to the longitudinal axis reducing the bolt-bounce problem. With these angles the geometrical transmission ratio of the bolt carrier to the bolthead became 3:1, so the rear bolt carrier was forced to move 3 times faster than the bolthead. The rearward forces on the bolt carrier and receiver were 2:1. The force and impulse transmitted to the receiver increases with the force and impulse transmitted to the bolt carrier. Making the bolt carrier heavier lessens the recoil velocity. For Mausers [[StG 45(M)]] project Maier assumed a {{convert|120|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt head and {{convert|360|g|oz|1|abbr=on}} bolt carrier (1 to 3 ratio). The prototype StG 45 (M) assault rifle had 18 longitudinal gas relief flutes cut in the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] wall to assist the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls during extraction. Fluting the end of the chamber provides pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior and thus ensures extraction without tearing the case making extraction easier and more reliable. In 1944 other German companies like Gro\u00dffu\u00df, Rheinmetall and Haenel showed interest in developing roller-delayed blowback small arms. Gro\u00dffu\u00df worked on a roller-delayed blowback [[MG 45]] general-purpose machine gun that, like the StG 45 (M), had not progressed beyond the prototype stage by the end of World War II.\n\nAfter World War II, former Mauser technicians Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L\u00f6ffler perfected the mechanism between 1946 and 1950 while working for the French small arms manufacturer [[Atelier M\u00e9canique de Mulhouse|Centre d'Etudes et d'Armament de Mulhouse]] (CEAM). In 1950 Ludwig Vorgrimler was recruited to work for [[CETME]] in Spain. The first full-scale production rifle to utilize roller-delay was the Spanish [[CETME rifle|CETME battle rifle]], which was closely followed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[SIG SG 510]] and the CETME Model B-based [[Heckler & Koch G3]]. The G3 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">Wo\u017aniak, Ryszard. Encyklopedia najnowszej broni palnej \u2013 tom 2 G-\u0141. Bellona. 2001. pp. 7\u201310.</ref> The G3's \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. Due to the relative low [[bolt thrust]] exhibited by pistol cartridges the anti-bounce mechanism is omitted by Heckler & Koch on their roller-delayed blowback firearms chambered for pistols cartridges. Heckler & Koch's [[Heckler & Koch MP5|MP5]] [[submachine gun]] is the most common weapon still in service worldwide using this system. The [[Heckler & Koch P9]] semi-automatic pistol, [[CETME Ameli]] light machine gun and [[Heckler & Koch HK21]] general-purpose machine gun also use it.\n\nRoller-delayed blowback arms are ammunition specific, since they lack an adjustable gas port or valve to adjust the arm to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior. Their reliable functioning is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. At the moment of cartridge ignition the chamber has to be and remain sealed, until the bullet has exited the barrel and the gas pressure within the bore has dropped to a safe level before the seal is broken and chamber starts to open. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms manufactures offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles and cylindrical rollers with different diameters. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and gas pressure drop management as the locking piece acts in unison with the bolt head carrier. The bolt gap width determines the [[Headspace (firearms)|headspace]] and hence the correct positioning of the cartridges in the (closed) chamber. Do to usage wear the bolt gap between the locking piece and bolt head carrier is expected to gradully increase. It can be determined and checked by a [[feeler gauge]] measurement and can be altered by changing the cylindrical rollers for rollers with a different diameter. Installing larger diameter rollers will increase the bolt gap and push the locking piece forward. Installing smaller diameter rollers results in the reverse effects.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\n\n===Lever-delayed===\n[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]\nLever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to put the bolt at a mechanical disadvantage, delaying the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. [[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]] patented the first known design for a lever-delay system.<ref>{{US Patent|1410270}}</ref> The mechanism was adapted by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] arms designer [[P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly]] in the 1930s and used in the [[Danuvia 43M submachine gun|Danuvia 39M and 43M]] submachine guns for the [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungarian Army]]. After the [[World War II]], Kir\u00e1ly settled in the [[Dominican Republic]] and developed the [[Crist\u00f3bal Carbine]]  (or Kir\u00e1ly-Crist\u00f3bal Carbine).

The [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] is never locked, and so is pushed rearward by the expanding [[propellant]] gases, as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt.

This seal prevents high-pressure gas from escaping into the action of the gun. Because a conventional chamber is slightly oversized, an unfired cartridge will enter freely. In a chamber-ring delayed firearm, the chamber is conventional in every respect except for a concave ring within the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired, the case expands into this recessed ring and pushes the bolt face rearward. As the case moves to the rear this ring constricts the expanded portion of the case. The energy required to squeeze the walls of the cartridge case slows the rearward travel of the case and slide, reducing their mass requirements. The first known use of the system was on the Fritz Mann pistol in 1920 and later on the High Standard Corp model T3 experimental pistol developed by Ott-Helmuth von Lossnitzer while working for High Standard.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414081723/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/high-standard-t3-prototype-an-american-blowback-at-james-d-julia/ |archive-date=2017-04-14 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143534/https://unblinkingeye.com/Guns/Mann/mann.html |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Other firearms that used this system were the LWS [[Seecamp]] pistol, the AMT Automag II, and the Kimball .30 Carbine pistol.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228090142/http://www.seecamp.com/caremaintenance.htm |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214242/http://modernfirearms.net/en/handguns/handguns-en/u-s-a-semi-automatic-pistols/amt-automag-ii-v-eng/ |archive-date=2018-03-13 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330143444/https://www.forgottenweapons.com/detroits-short-lived-kimball-30-carbine-pistol/ |archive-date=2018-03-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The [[SIG SG 510]] rifle family incorporates a chamber ring near the shoulder which is used to avoid bolt-bounce rather than a delay element.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404152628/http://www.biggerhammer.net/sigamt/iar/ |archive-date=2017-04-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Hesitation locked===\n[[John Pedersen (arms designer)|John Pedersen]]'s patented system incorporates a breech block independent of the slide or bolt carrier. When in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder located in the frame of the firearm. When the cartridge is fired, the cartridge case, bolt and slide move together a short distance until the breech block strikes the locking shoulder and stops. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase while the breech remains locked. This allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels once the bullet departs the barrel.

The French [[MAS-38]] submachine gun of 1938 utilizes a bolt whose path of recoil is at an angle to the barrel. The [[Jatimatic]] and [[KRISS Vector]] use modified versions of this concept.\n\n===Radial-delayed===\nCMMG introduced the [[CMMG Mk 45 Guard|Mk 45 Guard rifle]] incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses the [[Rotating bolt|rotation]] of the bolt head to accelerate the bolt carrier of an [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]] pattern rifle. The bolt locking lugs are adapted to incorporate 120\u00b0 angles that rotate the bolt as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the bolt rotates 22.5\u02da, it must accelerate the bolt carrier to the rear through an adapted 50\u00b0 angle cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the bolt carrier, slowing the speed of the bolt head.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180142972A1/ Radial delayed blowback operating system, such as for ar 15 platform US20180142972A1]</ref> This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier bolt carrier assembly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2017/4/25/cmmg-introduces-mkg45-guard-pistol-caliber-carbine/ |title=CMMG Mk45 |access-date=2018-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008061600/https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2017/4/25/cmmg-introduces-mkg45-guard-pistol-caliber-carbine/ |archive-date=2018-10-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the bolt carrier moving at a faster rate than the bolt head to delay the action from opening.

This weapon was ultimately not selected for production.\n\n==Other blowback systems==\n===Floating chamber===\n[[David Marshall Williams]] (a noted designer for the U.S. Ordnance Office and later [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]]) developed a mechanism to allow firearms designed for full-sized cartridges to fire .22 caliber rimfire ammunition reliably. His system used a small \"piston\" that incorporates the chamber.  When the cartridge is fired, the front of the floating chamber is thrust back by gas pressure impinging on the front of the chamber as in a traditional piston.  This, added to the blowback energy imparted on the cartridge, pushes the bolt back with greater energy than either force alone.  Often described as \"accelerated blowback\", this amplifies the otherwise anemic recoil energy of the .22 Rimfire cartridge.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_3_50/ai_112646118 |title=Charles E.

The increased recoil produced by the floating chamber made these training guns behave more like their full-power counterparts while still using inexpensive low-power ammunition.

Known prototypes using this method of operation include two 1936 rifle designs, one by Mihail Mamontov and another by Makar Goryainov at [[TsKB-14]], and [[Baryshev AVB-7.62|a 1980s design by A.F. Barishev]]. The Mamontov and Goryainov rifles are only partially automatic; only the bolt unlocking is powered by the gases pushing the cartridge back, while the rest of the cycle (ejection, reloading) is done manually as in a traditional bolt-action rifle. A major problem with using the case cartridge as piston is that its motion is much faster (about 1 ms) compared to tapping gas further down the bore through a piston\u2014about 5 ms in the [[Dragunov sniper rifle]], which used the same cartridge as Mamontov's rifle. Barishev made a fully automatic, but rather bulky mechanism that used a mechanical delay. In his system, the case cartridge pushed back a tilting bolt face, that upon reaching a certain angle pushes backwards an unlocking lever that continues farther before unlocking the bolt. The [[GRAU]] however still gave a negative evaluation of Barishev's gun, pointing out that the main problems with reliability of firearms using the cartridge case as a piston were known since the 1930s and still unsolved.<ref>\u0420. \u0427\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043a, [http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf \u0413\u0418\u041b\u042c\u0417\u041e\u0412\u042b\u0419 \u0414\u0412\u0418\u0413\u0410\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c. \u041e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513011523/http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/03f/gilzovyi-dvigatel.pdf |date=May 13, 2014 }}, ''Kalashnikov'' magazine 2012/11, pp. 72-77</ref>\n\n==Limited-utility designs==\n===Blish lock===\n{{main article|Blish lock}}\nThe Blish Lock is a breech locking mechanism designed by John Bell Blish based upon his observation that under extreme pressures, certain dissimilar metals will resist movement with a force greater than normal friction laws would predict. In modern engineering terminology, it is called static friction, or ''[[stiction]]''. His locking mechanism was used in the [[Thompson submachine gun]], [[Thompson Autorifle|Autorifle]] and [[Thompson Light Rifle|Autocarbine]] designs. This dubious principle was later eliminated as redundant in the M1 and M1A1 versions of the submachine guns at the insistence of the US Army.<ref>Soviet Submachine Guns Of World War II. Chris McNab, Osprey Publishing,2014.</ref> Lubrication or fouling would completely defeat any delay. Whatever actual advantage a clean, unlubricated Blish system could impart could also be attained by adding a mere ounce of mass to the bolt.<ref>Army Ordnance, December 1920</ref>\n\n===Savage rotating barrel===\nThe Savage system employed the theory that the rifling in the barrel caused a rotational force that would hold the gun locked until the projectile left the barrel.  It was later discovered that the bullet had left the barrel long before any locking could occur. Savage pistols were in fact operating as simple blow back firearms.<ref>{{citation |last=Hatcher |first=Julian |title=Hatchers Notebook |publisher=The Military Service Press Company |year=1947 |pages=259\u2013261 |isbn=0-8117-0795-4}}</ref>  The French [[MAB PA-15 pistol|MAB PA-15]] and PA-8 9mm pistols feature a similar design.\n\n==Other autoloading systems==\nOther autoloading systems are:\n* [[Blow forward]] where the barrel is the only moving component of the weapon that is dragged forward by the friction of the bullet until it leaves the barrel.\n* [[Recoil operation]] uses the rearward movement of parts of the weapon counter to the ejecta (bullet and propellant) moving forward, as described by [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]].\n* [[Gas-operated reloading]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of blow forward firearms]]\n* [[List of delayed-blowback firearms]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bremner, Derek, ''The MG42V and the Origins of Delayed Blowback Roller Lock: WWII German Equipment'' (Paperback). {{ISBN|0-9533792-0-5}}.\n*{{cite book| last = Chinn| first = George M.| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1955| chapter =| title = The Machine Gun, Volume IV: Design Analysis of Automatic Firing Mechanisms and Related Components| publisher = Bureau of Ordnance, Department of the Navy| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Blowback operation}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXVPUxqbgII How Does it Work: Blowback Action] Forgotten Weapons\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbIV9-kyphY How Does it Work: Gas-Delayed Blowback] Forgotten Weapons\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utv6LK6CxJI How Does It Work: Lever Delayed Blowback] Forgotten Weapons\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback] Forgotten Weapons\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080724175150/http://www.smallarmsreview.com/pdf/TZ45.pdf Information about the TZ45 submachine gun and the concept of advanced primer ignition]\n*[http://science.howstuffworks.com/machine-gun6.htm Blowback action], Animation and explanation at howstuffworks.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302035403/http://www.hecklerkoch-usa.com/index.jsp?loc=231&SITEID=B&PartNumber=MP51 Heckler and Koch USA now uses the \"roller-delayed blowback\" terminology]\n*[https://archive.is/20130105175139/http://www.wikipatents.com/4061075.html Blow-Forward operated submachine gun patent]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110831010932/http://www.wikipatents.com/5123329.html Blow-Forward firearm patent]\n*[http://www.google.com/patents/US1472126 Kewish primer actuated patent (1/4 assigned to Garand)]\n*[http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US1603684 US1603684] Garand patent making reference to earlier primer actuated application in 1919.\n*[http://www.leagle.com/decision/194689467FSupp827_1752.xml/BURKE%20v.%20UNITED%20STATES ''Burke v US'', 67 F.Supp 827 (1947)] has comment about [[John T.

Pathanapuram was the capital of one of the two districts of Elayidathu Swaroopam.  In 1764,  King Marthandavarma conquered Elayidathu Swaroopam and annexed  it to [[Travancore]].\t\nMost parts of Pathanapuram taluk were inhabited since before the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and civilization may have existed in and around Pathanapuram  beginning  the 1st Century.   The name Pathanapuram may have evolved from the fact that the area had a sizeable elephant population and  elephants were caught and trained/tamed for work  at the elephant cage/camp at the Town.  The Old [[police station]] area used to  be the elephant Camp.   The name can be translated as Path =(10)+Ana = (elephant) + Puram = (Town)\n\n==Geography==\nPathanapuram is spread over an area of {{Convert|24.20|km2|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{As of|2011}} [[census of India]], Pathanapuram Panchayat had a [[population]] of 32,339.
