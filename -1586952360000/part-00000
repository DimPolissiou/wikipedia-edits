Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.\n\n===As a preservative===\nSulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.</ref> when used in this way in Europe.

Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with \"containing [[sulfite]]s\".\n\nSulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require \"contains sulfites\" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and ros\u00e9 wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],<ref>[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University</ref> a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.<ref>[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal.</ref>\n\n===As a reducing agent===\nSulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is not present to any extent.

Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an [[enzyme]] that produces endogenous SO<sub>2</sub> significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment.

Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.\n\n===As a preservative===\nSulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.</ref> when used in this way in Europe.

Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with \"containing [[sulfite]]s\".\n\nSulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require \"contains sulfites\" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and ros\u00e9 wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],<ref>[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University</ref> a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.<ref>[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal.</ref>\n\n===As a reducing agent===\nSulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is not present to any extent.

Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all.

This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}.

Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

Listeners familiar with music of the (European) [[common practice period]] perceive [[tonality|tonal]] music as that which uses [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[musical scale|scales]], wherein both the [[major third]] and [[minor third]] constitute the basic ''structural elements'' of the harmony. \n\nRegarding chords built from perfect fourths alone, composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] writes that:\n{{quote|Chords by perfect fourth are ambiguous in that, like all chords built by equidistant intervals ([[Diminished seventh chord|diminished seventh chords]] or [[Augmented triad|augmented triads]]), any member can function as the [[Root (chord)|root]]. The indifference of this rootless harmony to tonality places the burden of [[Key (music)|key]] verification upon the [[Part (music)|voice]] with the most active melodic line. {{harv|Persichetti|1961|loc=94}}|sign=|source=}}\n\n''Quintal harmony'' (the harmonic layering of fifths specifically) is a lesser-used term, and since the fifth is the [[Inversion (interval)|inversion]] or [[Complement (music)|complement]] of the fourth, it is usually considered indistinct from ''quartal harmony''. Because of this relationship, any quartal chord can be rewritten as a quintal chord by changing the order of its pitches.\n\nLike tertian chords, a given quartal or quintal chord can be written with different [[Voicing (music)|voicings]], some of which obscure its quartal structure. For instance, the quartal chord, C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}, can be written as<blockquote><score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n\n{\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c f bes>1 <f bes c> <bes c f> <f bes c f>\n} }\n</score></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], simultaneous notes a fourth apart were heard as a consonance.  During the [[common practice period]] (between about 1600 and 1900), this interval came to be heard either as a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] (when appearing as a [[Suspension (music)|suspension]] requiring resolution in the [[voice leading]]) or as a [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (when the root of the chord appears in parts higher than the fifth of the chord).  In the later 19th century, during the [[Emancipation of the dissonance|breakdown of tonality]] in [[classical music]], all intervallic relationships were once again reassessed.  Quartal harmony was developed in the early [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] as a result of this breakdown and reevaluation of tonality.\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[Tristan chord]] is made up of the notes F{{music|natural}}, B{{music|natural}}, D{{music|sharp}} and G{{music|sharp}} and is the first chord heard in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]''.  \n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\voiceOne \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5\n                \\once \\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5\n                \\voiceTwo \\partial8 a\\pp( f'4.~\\< f4 e8 \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\> d!4.)~\\p d8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\key a \\minor \\time 6/8\n                \\partial8 r8 R2. \\once \\override NoteHead.color = #red <f b>2.( <e gis>4.)~ <e gis>8 r r\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\nThe bottom two notes make up an augmented fourth, while the upper two make up a perfect fourth. This layering of fourths in this context has been seen as highly significant.  The chord had been found in earlier works ({{harvnb|Vogel|1962|loc=12}}), notably [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 18 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 18]], but Wagner's use was significant, first because it is seen as moving away from traditional [[tonal harmony]] and even towards [[atonality]], and second because with this chord Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its [[Functional harmony|function]], a notion which was soon after to be explored by [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and others ({{harvnb|Erickson|1975}}, {{Page needed|date=June 2012}}).  \n\nDespite the layering of fourths, it is rare to find musicologists identifying this chord as \"quartal harmony\" or even as \"proto-quartal harmony\", since Wagner's musical language is still essentially built on thirds, and even an ordinary [[dominant seventh]] chord can be laid out as augmented fourth plus perfect fourth (F\u2013B\u2013D\u2013G). Wagner's unusual chord is really a device to draw the listener into the musical-dramatic argument which the composer is presenting to us.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, quartal harmony finally became an important element of harmony. [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] used a self-developed system of transposition using fourth-chords, like his [[Mystic chord]] (shown below) in his [[Piano Sonata No. 6 (Scriabin)|Piano Sonata No. 6]]. \n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' { \n  \\clef treble \\time 4/4 <c fis bes e a d>1\n} }\n</score>\n\nScriabin wrote this chord in his sketches alongside other quartal passages and more traditional [[tertian]] passages, often passing between systems, for example widening the six-note quartal sonority (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D) into a seven-note chord (C\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E\u2013A\u2013D\u2013G). Scriabin's sketches for his unfinished work ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'' show that he intended to develop the Mystic chord into a huge chord incorporating all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] {{harv|Morrison|1998|loc=316}}.<!-- image may be allowed for this article only: see the licensing question on its page -->\n\nIn France, [[Erik Satie]] experimented with [[Parallel harmony|planing]] in the stacked fourths (not all perfect) of his 1891 score for ''[[Le Fils des \u00e9toiles]]'' {{harv|Solomon|2003}}. [[Paul Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1897) has a rising repetition in fourths, as the tireless work of out-of-control walking brooms causes the water level in the house to \"rise and rise\". \n===20th- and 21st-century classical music===\nComposers who use the techniques of quartal harmony include [[Claude Debussy]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Herder|1987|loc=78}}.\n\n==== Schoenberg ====\n[[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[Chamber Symphony No. 1|Chamber Symphony Op. 9]] (1906) displays quartal harmony: the first measures construct a five-part fourth chord with the notes C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|flat}}\u2013E{{music|flat}}\u2013A{{music|flat}} distributed over several instruments.\n\n[[Image:SchoenbergOp9.png|thumb|280x280px|Vertical quartal-harmony in the opening measures of Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9 {{audio|SchoenbergOp9.mid|Play}}|alt=|center]]\n\n[[Image:Sch\u00f6nberg Kammersymhonie 9 for wikipedia.png|thumb|250x250px|Six-note horizontal fourth chord in Arnold Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony Op. 9|alt=]]\n\nThe composer then picks out this vertical quartal harmony in a horizontal sequence of fourths from the horns, eventually leading to a passage of triadic quartal harmony (i.e., chords of three notes, each layer a fourth apart).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSchoenberg was also one of the first to write on the theoretical consequences of this harmonic innovation. In his ''Theory of Harmony'' (''Harmonielehre'') of 1911, he wrote:\n{{quote|The construction of chords by superimposing fourths can lead to a chord that contains all the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]]; hence, such construction does manifest a possibility for dealing systematically with those harmonic phenomena that already exist in the works of some of us: seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve-part chords\u2026 But the quartal construction makes possible, as I said, accommodation of all phenomena of harmony. {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=406\u2013407}}}}\n\nFor [[Anton Webern]], the importance of quartal harmony lay in the possibility of building new sounds. After hearing Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony, Webern wrote \"You must write something like that, too!\" ({{harvnb|Webern|1963|loc=48}}; \"So was mu\u00dft du auch machen!\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}<!--Source for the German text needed.-->)\n\n==== Others ====\nIn his ''Theory of Harmony'' {{harv|Schoenberg|1978|loc=407}}: \"Besides myself my students Dr. Anton Webern and [[Alban Berg]] have written these harmonies (fourth chords), but also the Hungarian [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] or the Viennese [[Franz Schreker]], who both go a similar way to Debussy, Dukas and perhaps also [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], are not far off.\"<!--- (\u201eAu\u00dfer mir haben meine Sch\u00fcler Dr. Anton Webern und Alban Berg solche Kl\u00e4nge [gemeint sind Quartenkl\u00e4nge] geschrieben.

In his 1937 writing ''Unterweisung im Tonsatz'' (''The Craft of Musical Composition'', {{harvnb|Hindemith|1937}}), he wrote that \"notes have a family of relationships, that are the bindings of tonality, in which the ranking of intervals is unambiguous,\"<!--- (\u201edass die T\u00f6ne eine Familienzugeh\u00f6rigkeit besitzen, die sich in der Bindung an tonale Hauptt\u00f6ne \u00e4u\u00dfert, die eine unzweideutige Rangliste der Tonverwandschaften aufstellt.\u201c)---> so much so, indeed, that in the art of triadic composition \"\u2026the musician is bound by this, as the painter to his primary colours, the architect to the three dimensions.\"<!--- (\u201e... der Musiker ist an ihn gebunden, wie der Maler an die prim\u00e4ren Farben, der Architekt an die drei Dimensionen.\u201c)---> He lined up the harmonic and melodic aspects of music in a row in which the octave ranks first, then the fifth and the third, and then the fourth. \"The strongest and most unique harmonic interval after the octave is the fifth, the prettiest nevertheless is the third by right of the chordal effects of its [[Combination tone]]s.\"<!--- (\u201eDas st\u00e4rkste und eindeutige harmonische Intervall ist n\u00e4chst der alleinstehenden  Oktave die Quinte, das sch\u00f6nste jedoch die Terz wegen ihrer in den Kombinationst\u00f6nen begr\u00fcndeten Akkordwirkung.\u201c)--->\n\n[[Image:Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.png|thumb|center|378x378px|Quartal harmony in Hindemith's Flute Sonata, II with tonal center on B established by descent in left hand in [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and repeated B's and F{{music|sharp}}'s {{harv|Kostka, Payne, and Alm\u00e9n|2013|loc=Chapter twenty six: Materials and techniques, Chord structures, Quartal and secundal harmony, 469\u201370<!--  Meaningful subheadings simplify reference in translations and other editions (p. 498 in third ed.) -->}} {{Audio|Hindemith, Flute Sonata, II quartal harmony.mid|Play}}|alt=]]The works of the Filipino composer [[Eliseo M.

In the first movement of his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] altered fourth chords descend chromatically in the right hand with a chromatic scale leading upward in the left hand.\n\n===Jazz===\nThe style of jazz, having an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] harmonic orbit, was in its [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|early days]] overtaken (until perhaps the [[Swing (genre)|Swing]] of the 1930s) by the vocabulary of 19th-century European music.{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}<!--This makes almost no sense at all.

This particular voicing is sometimes referred to as a [[So What chord]], and can be analyzed (without regard for added sixths, ninths, etc.) as a minor seventh with the root on the bottom, or as a major seventh with the third on the bottom {{harv|Levine|1989|loc=97}}.\n\nFrom the outset of the 1960s, the employment of quartal possibilities had become so familiar that the musician now felt the fourth chord existed as a separate entity, self standing and free of any need to resolve. The pioneering of quartal writing in later jazz and rock, like the pianist [[McCoy Tyner]]'s work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]'s \"classic quartet\", was influential throughout this epoch. [[Oliver Nelson]] was also known for his use of fourth chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]] {{harv|Corozine|2002|loc=12}}.

Jazz was well-suited to incorporate the medieval use of fourths to thicken lines into its improvisation. The pianists [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Chick Corea]] are two musicians well known for their modal experimentation. Around this time, a style known as [[free jazz]] also came into being, in which quartal harmony had extensive use due to the wandering nature of its harmony.\n\n[[Image:Maiden Voyage2.png|thumb|center|400px|Fourths in Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\"{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}]]\n\nIn jazz, the way chords were built from a scale came to be called [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and specifically quartal harmony was referred to as fourth voicing.\n\n[[Image:Quartal voicings.png|thumb|center|400px|[[ii-V-I turnaround]] with fourth voicings: all chords are in fourth voicings {{audio|Quartal voicings.mid|Play}}; They are often ambiguous as, for example, the Dm11 and G9sus chords are here voiced identically and will thus be distinguished for the listener by the [[root (chord)|root]] movement of the [[bassist]] {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=94}}]]\n\nThus when the m11 and the dominant 7th sus (9sus above) chords in quartal voicings are used together they tend to \"blend into one overall sound\" sometimes referred to as modal voicings, and both may be applied where the m11 chord is called for during extended periods such as the entire chorus {{harv|Boyd|1997|loc=95}}.\n\n===Rock music===\n[[image:Robert Fripp.jpg|right|thumb|Disliking the sound of thirds (in equal-temperament tuning), Robert Fripp builds chords with perfect intervals in his new&nbsp;standard tuning.]]\n{{See also|Progressive rock|Symphonic rock}}\n\nQuartal and quintal harmony have been used by [[Robert Fripp]], who has described himself as the <!-- self-described.

A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas [[acetylene]].

Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin parts after coming into contact with rain droplets. However, meteorologists sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.<ref name=\"20150818ibtimes\" />\n\nThousands of dead [[stickleback]]s washed up on the banks 6&nbsp;km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.

The ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.<ref name=\"wsws\" />\n\nThe morning following the explosion military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts. Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation. Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere. Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.

The plant consists of two [[Glossary of botanical terms#plicate|plicate]] leaves near the ground. From between those leaves sprouts a long, pubescent stalk that bears a single pink flower. The [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s tend to be yellowish-brown to maroon with a large pouch that is usually some shade of pink but can be nearly magenta. The white pouched-green petaled forma alba can occasionally be found mixed in with normal populations.\n\n== Cultivation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Cypripedium acaule var. alba.jpg|thumb|left|''Cypripedium acaule'' var. ''alba'']]\nSeed [[germination]] labs have increased the commercial availability of ''C. acaule'', although it still tends to be less commonly available than other ''Cypripedium'' species and hybrids. This is primarily due to the extra care that must be provided if the growing site is not naturally suitable for in-ground cultivation. This plant grows in soils below a [[pH]] of 5, often at 4\u20134.5. At this high acidity soil fungus is suppressed, and ''C.'' ''acaule'' can thrive. There is even evidence that it is partially [[myco-heterotrophic]], parasitizing fungus that attempts to invade its roots. However, in soils above pH 5, soil microbes become more than ''C.'' ''acaule'' can manage, and the plants rot. Seedlings germinated in a sterile environment can grow and thrive in a much higher pH than 5, but must be grown below 5 if removed from the sterility.\n\nFor artificial cultivation, container culture is a must, and the growing medium must be naturally acidic. Additionally, all other soil additives must be devoid of any calcium that could buffer the pH to above 5. High quality peat moss or pine duff work well, and pH neutral perlite<!-- Do you mean volcanic glass; add link to another Wiki page? --> can be added to improve porosity. Due to the risk of [[calcium bicarbonate]], tap water is unsuitable. Rainwater or distilled water mixed with {{convert|2|oz}} of vinegar per gallon will assure that a reliably high acidity is maintained in the growing medium. Give bright dappled shade or morning sun. Sink pots in winter or store in a cold frame for insulation.

The plant consists of two [[Glossary of botanical terms#plicate|plicate]] leaves near the ground. From between those leaves sprouts a long, pubescent stalk that bears a single pink flower. The [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s tend to be yellowish-brown to maroon with a large pouch that is usually some shade of pink but can be nearly magenta. The white pouched-green petaled forma alba can occasionally be found mixed in with normal populations.\n\n== Cultivation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Cypripedium acaule var. alba.jpg|thumb|left|''Cypripedium acaule'' var. ''alba'']]\nSeed [[germination]] labs have increased the commercial availability of ''C. acaule'', although it still tends to be less commonly available than other ''Cyp'' species and hybrids. This is primarily due to the extra care that must be provided if the growing site is not naturally suitable for in-ground cultivation. This plant grows in soils below a [[pH]] of 5, often at 4\u20134.5. At this high acidity soil fungus is suppressed, and ''acaule'' can thrive. There is even evidence that it is partially [[myco-heterotrophic]] by parasitizing fungus that attempts to invade its roots. However, above pH 5 the soil microbes become more than ''acaule'' can manage and the plants rot. Seedlings germinated in a sterile environment can grow and thrive in a much higher pH than 5, but must be grown below 5 if removed from the sterility.\n\nFor artificial cultivation container culture is a must, and the growing medium must be naturally acidic. Additionally, all other soil additives must be devoid of any calcium that could buffer the pH to above 5. High quality peat moss or pine duff work well, and pH neutral perlite can be added to improve porosity. Due to the risk of calcium bicarbonate, tap water is unsuitable. Rainwater or distilled water mixed with {{convert|2|oz}} of vinegar per gallon will assure that a reliably high acidity is maintained in the growing medium. Give bright dappled shade or morning sun. Sink pots in winter or store in a cold frame for insulation. Given these conditions ''C. acaule'' can thrive indefinitely, but will always require much more maintenance than other species/hybrids that can be grown in a wider pH range.\n\n[[File:The Botanical Magazine, Plate 192 (Volume 6, 1793).png|thumb|right|A drawing published in ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]'' in 1793]]\n\n==Range==\n''Cypripedium acaule'' can be found in the eastern third of the [[United States]], particularly in the [[Great Lakes Region]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], south along the [[Appalachians]] to [[Alabama]].
