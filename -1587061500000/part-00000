By the 1980s, Jack LaLanne's European Health Spas numbered more than 200. He eventually licensed all his health clubs to the Bally company, now known as [[Bally Total Fitness]].  Though not associated with any gym, LaLanne continued to lift weights until his death.\n\nLaLanne's gym ownership led to a brief [[professional wrestling]] career in 1938.  Wrestlers were among the few athletes who embraced weight training, and they frequented his health club. LaLanne wrestled in the [[Bay Area]] for only a few months. He was well respected enough that he was [[kayfabe|booked]] to wrestle to a draw against some big name opponents rather than lose, despite his lack of experience. According to Ad Santel's grandson David Ad Santel, LaLanne wanted to be a champion from the start, but did not have the wrestling skills to do so.{{cn|date=January 2017}} LaLanne was also friendly with such performers as [[Lou Thesz]] and [[Strangler Lewis]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Books, television and other media===\n\n[[File:Jack LaLanne 1961.JPG|thumb|Jack LaLanne in 1961]]\n\nLaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years. ''[[The Jack LaLanne Show]]'' was the longest-running television exercise program.  According to the SF Chronicle TV program archives, it first began on 28 September 1953 as a 15-minute local morning program (sandwiched between the morning news and a cooking show) on [[San Francisco|San Francisco's]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television station, [[KGO-TV]], with LaLanne paying for the airtime himself as a way to promote his gym and related health products.  LaLanne also met his wife Elaine while she was working for the local station.  In 1959, the show was picked up for nationwide syndication, and continued until 1985.\n\nThe show was noted for its minimalist set, where LaLanne inspired his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience \"with the enthusiasm of an evangelist,\" to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today's fitness videos.<ref name=Encyc/><ref>[http://www.jacklalanne.com/watch-jack/ Jack LaLanne Show video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216034740/http://www.jacklalanne.com/watch-jack/ |date=16 February 2010 }}</ref>{{rp|watch}} In 1959, LaLanne recorded ''Glamour Stretcher Time'', a workout album that provided [[phonograph]]-based instruction for exercising with an elastic cord called the Glamour Stretcher.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2006/01/11/fashion/20060112_FITN_SLIDESHOW_1.html Jack LaLanne's Glamour Stretcher, NYTimes Exercise Product History]</ref>  As a daytime show, much of LaLanne's audience were stay-at-home mothers.  Wife Elaine LaLanne was part of the show to demonstrate the exercises, as well as the fact that doing them would not ruin their figures or musculature.  LaLanne also included his dog Happy as a way to attract children to the show.  Later in the run, another dog named Walter was used, with LaLanne claiming \"Walter\" stood for \"We All Love To Exercise Regularly.\"\n\nLaLanne published several books and [[video]]s on fitness and nutrition, appeared in movies, and recorded a song with [[Connie Haines]]. He marketed [[exercise equipment]], a range of [[vitamin]] supplements, and two models of electric [[juicer]]s.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703398504576100923135057068 Jack LaLanne, Media Fitness Guru, Dies at 96 \u2013 Wall Street Journal] Published 24 January 2011.

His breakfast, after working out for two hours, consisted of hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, oatmeal with [[soy milk]], and seasonal fruit. For dinner, he and his wife typically ate raw vegetables, egg whites, and fish. He did not drink coffee.<ref name=NYT-obit />\n\n===Exercise===\nWhen exercising, LaLanne worked out repetitively with weights until he experienced \"muscle fatigue\" in whatever muscle groups he was exercising, or when it became impossible for him to go on with a particular routine. This is now a common practise and is most often referred to as \"training to failure\". LaLanne moved from exercise to exercise without stopping. To contradict critics who thought this would leave him tightly musclebound and uncoordinated, LaLanne liked to demonstrate one-handed balancing. His home contained two gyms and a pool that he used daily.<ref name=NYT-obit/> \n\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Jack LaLanne.jpg|thumb|left|LaLanne receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 at Muscle Beach in [[Venice Beach, California]]]]}}\n\nHe continued with his two-hour workouts into his 90s, which also included walking.<ref name=\"CNN-at89\">{{cite news |title=Fitness guru Jack LaLanne still going strong at 89|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/diet.fitness/01/19/jack.lalanne.ap/ |publisher=CNN.com|date=19 January 2004  |accessdate=23 January 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904075927/http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/diet.fitness/01/19/jack.lalanne.ap/ |archivedate = 4 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe stated, \"If I died, people would say 'Oh look, Jack LaLanne died.

And I say to myself 'I don't want to live like that. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I need to live life.

It's like an athletic event. You've got to train for it. You've got to eat right. You've got to exercise. Your health account, your bank account, they're the same thing.

''Finding Your Own Fountain of Youth: The Essential Guide to Maximizing Health'', Paul Mould Publ. (2008) p. 191</ref>}}\n\n===Views on food additives and drugs===\n\nLaLanne often stressed that artificial food additives, drugs, and processed foods contributed to making people mentally and physically ill. As a result, he writes, many people turn to alcohol and drugs to deal with symptoms of ailments, noting that \"a stream of aches and pains seems to encompass us as we get older.\"<ref name=LaLanne-book>LaLanne, Jack.

They had three children: a daughter named Yvonne LaLanne from his first marriage, a son named Dan Doyle from Elaine's first marriage, and a son named Jon LaLanne together.

By the 1980s, Jack LaLanne's European Health Spas numbered more than 200. He eventually licensed all his health clubs to the Bally company, now known as [[Bally Total Fitness]].  Though not associated with any gym, LaLanne continued to lift weights until his death.\n\nLaLanne's gym ownership led to a brief [[professional wrestling]] career in 1938.  Wrestlers were among the few athletes who embraced weight training, and they frequented his health club. LaLanne wrestled in the [[Bay Area]] for only a few months. He was well respected enough that he was [[kayfabe|booked]] to wrestle to a draw against some big name opponents rather than lose, despite his lack of experience. According to Ad Santel's grandson David Ad Santel, LaLanne wanted to be a champion from the start, but did not have the wrestling skills to do so.{{cn|date=January 2017}} LaLanne was also friendly with such performers as [[Lou Thesz]] and [[Strangler Lewis]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Books, television and other media===\n\n[[File:Jack LaLanne 1961.JPG|thumb|Jack LaLanne in 1961]]\n\nLaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years. ''[[The Jack LaLanne Show]]'' was the longest-running television exercise program.  According to the SF Chronicle TV program archives, it first began on 28 September 1953 as a 15-minute local morning program (sandwiched between the morning news and a cooking show) on [[San Francisco|San Francisco's]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television station, [[KGO-TV]], with LaLanne paying for the airtime himself as a way to promote his gym and related health products.  LaLanne also met his wife Elaine while she was working for the local station.  In 1959, the show was picked up for nationwide syndication, and continued until 1985.\n\nThe show was noted for its minimalist set, where LaLanne inspired his viewers to use basic home objects, such as a chair, to perform their exercises along with him. Wearing his standard jumpsuit, he urged his audience \"with the enthusiasm of an evangelist,\" to get off their couch and copy his basic movements, a manner considered the forerunner of today's fitness videos.<ref name=Encyc/><ref>[http://www.jacklalanne.com/watch-jack/ Jack LaLanne Show video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216034740/http://www.jacklalanne.com/watch-jack/ |date=16 February 2010 }}</ref>{{rp|watch}} In 1959, LaLanne recorded ''Glamour Stretcher Time'', a workout album that provided [[phonograph]]-based instruction for exercising with an elastic cord called the Glamour Stretcher.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2006/01/11/fashion/20060112_FITN_SLIDESHOW_1.html Jack LaLanne's Glamour Stretcher, NYTimes Exercise Product History]</ref>  As a daytime show, much of LaLanne's audience were stay-at-home mothers.  Wife Elaine LaLanne was part of the show to demonstrate the exercises, as well as the fact that doing them would not ruin their figures or musculature.  LaLanne also included his dog Happy as a way to attract children to the show.  Later in the run, another dog named Walter was used, with LaLanne claiming \"Walter\" stood for \"We All Love To Exercise Regularly.\"\n\nLaLanne published several books and [[video]]s on fitness and nutrition, appeared in movies, and recorded a song with [[Connie Haines]].

His breakfast, after working out for two hours, consisted of hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, oatmeal with [[soy milk]], and seasonal fruit. For dinner, he and his wife typically ate raw vegetables, egg whites, and fish. He did not drink coffee.<ref name=NYT-obit />\n\n===Exercise===\nWhen exercising, LaLanne worked out repetitively with weights until he experienced \"muscle fatigue\" in whatever muscle groups he was exercising, or when it became impossible for him to go on with a particular routine. This is now a common practise and is most often referred to as \"training to failure\". LaLanne moved from exercise to exercise without stopping. To contradict critics who thought this would leave him tightly musclebound and uncoordinated, LaLanne liked to demonstrate one-handed balancing. His home contained two gyms and a pool that he used daily.<ref name=NYT-obit/> \n\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Jack LaLanne.jpg|thumb|left|LaLanne receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 at Muscle Beach in [[Venice Beach, California]]]]}}\n\nHe continued with his two-hour workouts into his 90s, which also included walking.<ref name=\"CNN-at89\">{{cite news |title=Fitness guru Jack LaLanne still going strong at 89|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/diet.fitness/01/19/jack.lalanne.ap/ |publisher=CNN.com|date=19 January 2004  |accessdate=23 January 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070904075927/http://www.cnn.com/2004/HEALTH/diet.fitness/01/19/jack.lalanne.ap/ |archivedate = 4 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe stated, \"If I died, people would say 'Oh look, Jack LaLanne died. He didn't practice what he preached.'\"<ref name=NYT-obit/> When asked about sex, LaLanne had a standard joke, saying that despite their advanced age, he and his wife still made love almost every night: \"Almost on Monday, almost on Tuesday, almost on Wednesday...\"\n\nHe added, \"I know so many people in their 80s who have Alzheimer's or are in a wheelchair or whatever. And I say to myself 'I don't want to live like that. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I need to live life. And I'd hate dying; it would ruin my image.'\"\n\nLaLanne summed up his philosophy about good nutrition and exercise:\n\n{{cquote|Dying is easy. Living is a pain in the butt. It's like an athletic event. You've got to train for it. You've got to eat right. You've got to exercise. Your health account, your bank account, they're the same thing. The more you put in, the more you can take out. Exercise is king and nutrition is queen: together, you have a kingdom.<ref>Siegel M.D., Andrew. ''Finding Your Own Fountain of Youth: The Essential Guide to Maximizing Health'', Paul Mould Publ. (2008) p. 191</ref>}}\n\n===Views on food additives and drugs===\n\nLaLanne often stressed that artificial food additives, drugs, and processed foods contributed to making people mentally and physically ill. As a result, he writes, many people turn to alcohol and drugs to deal with symptoms of ailments, noting that \"a stream of aches and pains seems to encompass us as we get older.\"<ref name=LaLanne-book>LaLanne, Jack. ''Revitalize Your Life: Improve Your Looks, Your Health & Your Sex Life'', Hastings House (2003)</ref>{{rp|114}} He refers to the human bloodstream as a \"River of Life\", which is \"polluted\" by \"junk foods\" loaded with \"preservatives, salt, sugar, and artificial flavorings\".<ref name=LaLanne-book/>{{rp|167}}\n\nRelying on evidence from The President's Council on Physical Fitness, he also agrees that \"many of our aches and pains come from lack of physical activity.\" As an immediate remedy for symptoms such as constipation, insomnia, tiredness, anxiety, shortness of breath, or high blood pressure, LaLanne states that people will resort to various drugs: \"We look for crutches such as sleeping pills, pep pills, alcohol, cigarettes, and so on.\"<ref name=LaLanne-book/>\n\n==Family==\nLaLanne was married to his second wife, Elaine Doyle LaLanne, for over five decades. They had three children: a daughter named Yvonne LaLanne from his first marriage, a son named Dan Doyle from Elaine's first marriage, and a son named Jon LaLanne together.
