Nathan is quickly acquainted with her son Jonah, and the two spend the afternoon in the garden of Slade House whilst Norah Grayer entertains Nathan\u2019s mother. Nathan begins hallucinating strange people and other visions and becomes worried that the [[Valium]] he took from his mother is having a bad effect. After being invited into the house, he experiences more hallucinations before finding himself at his father's lodge in [[Rhodesia]]. This dream is quickly broken by the Grayers, who reveal themselves to be twin siblings and carnivorous Anchorites, beings who steal the souls of certain people to maintain their youth. The Anchorites conduct a ceremony, and feast on Nathan\u2019s soul.\n\n=== Shining Armour ===\nIn 1988, a detective inspector, Gordon Edmonds, is investigating Slade Alley, and stumbles into the garden. There, he meets a widowed woman named Chloe Chetwynd. While they talk, Edmonds hears children playing but is confused to see there are none. Edmonds reveals he\u2019s investigating the disappearance of the Bishops, who were assumed to have fled debts, but a window cleaner awakened from a coma revealed his interactions with them on the day of their disappearance. The inspector and Chloe strike up a relationship, and Chloe reveals that the voices Edmonds heard are ghosts she too hears. They become intimate, but it is short-lived. Edmonds is lured upstairs, and has a brief encounter with the remnants of Nathan. The twins reveal they are not members of the Anchorites, but act alone. Norah, to Jonah's disdain, believes they can no longer operate as they have. They begin their ceremony and absorb Edmonds' soul.\n\n=== Oink Oink ===\nIn 1997, a group of students belonging to a [[paranormal]] club converge upon Slade House, intending to investigate the disappearances of the Bishops and Edmonds. One of the students, Sally Timms, is infatuated with a fellow member. The leader of the group is the nephew of Fred Pink, the window cleaner who saw the Bishops before they disappeared. The group stumble into a previously non-existent Slade House and discover it appears as a student house in the throes of a [[Halloween]] party. Sally mingles with the guests of the party before waking to find herself next to a frozen man implied to be Inspector Edmonds, who hands her a weapon, a hairpin with a fox head. Sally is led to the attic via the Grayers' mind games. The twins argue once again about their methods, and prepare their ceremony. Sally swears someone will stop them, and then her soul is consumed.\n\n=== You Dark Horse You ===\nIn 2006, Sally Timms' sister Freya meets with Fred Pink in a pub near the supposed Slade House. Pink reveals he has been investigating the House and the Grayers for years. He tells her they were born in the late 1800s, and were known for their mystical abilities. They travelled the world learning all they could and eventually retired to Slade House in the 1930s. They used their power to isolate Slade House from time, placing it in a bubble where it existed long after its destruction during bombings in the 1940s. Freya, believing Pink to be mad, intends to leave, but finds herself in the attic of Slade House. Jonah reveals he was playing Pink all along. Norah is furious with him for revealing their history to Freya, but they begin their ceremony. Just as Freya's soul is taken from her body, Sally appears, stabbing Jonah in the neck with the fox pin. The twins are enraged, and Freya's soul is not consumed and allowed to pass on.\n\n=== Astronauts ===\nIn 2015, Norah Grayer invites the former [[psychologist]] of Fred Pink, a Doctor Iris Marinus-Fenby, to Slade House. After eighteen years without fresh energy, the house's reality is decaying and Jonah remains injured and trapped in the attic. Norah inhabits the body of a young [[conspiracy theorist]], who lures Iris into the garden with the insistence Pink was not mad. Within the reality of Slade House, it is clearly fading away, and a weakened Norah and Jonah are unable to play their normal mind games. Iris is drawn to the attic, where Jonah and Norah prepare to consume her, but at the last minute she reveals herself to be an Horologist, immortals who are reincarnated as opposed to the Shaded Way method of consuming souls for [[immortality]]. Marinus criticises the antiquity of the Grayers' methods compared to new ones, and encourages Jonah to attack, allowing her to easily destroy him. She leaves Norah in the collapsing attic of Slade House's final moments to age and wither into nothing. At the last second, Norah, enraged and powered by the desire for revenge, transplants her soul into an unborn child.\n\n== Allusions and references ==\nAs with all of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] novels, ''Slade House'' contains references to his other works; be they people, places or events. \n*The primary antagonists of the story are soul carnivores, people who learned dark arts in order to subsist on the souls of people with psychic gifts in order to maintain their youth. Soul carnivores are first introduced in ''[[The Bone Clocks]]''. \n*A vision of Mrs Bishop presented to Inspector Edmonds mentions that she has dreamed of being carried away to [[Zedelgem]] by the composer Vyvyan Ayrs, a direct reference to ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]''. \n*Sally's crush mentions that his mother transcribed the Crispin Hershey novel Desiccated Embryos.

His devotees offer him sweets to celebrate the government's declaration that the local tribe of primitive people are terrorists. An army is deployed to repel the so-called terrorists, but after some of the army's soldiers are killed by the Ace Archers, the army plans a mission that will remove the primitive people. Guruji dislikes the idea of declaring the primitive people terrorists. According to Guruji, all people are humans, and no inhumane treatment is justified. He believes that even if the local primitive people behave in an uncivilised way, they are not animals, and that every person has the ability to be transformed by love and affection. Even though the primitive people endanger Guruji's life, Guruji decides to advocate for them. A police inspector named Arjun attacks the primitive people, but Guruji saves him after he is badly injured. Arjun goes to meet Guruji with Babru. Guruji also saves the life of the Tibru tribe's leader, Babru's son, and gains his confidence. Babru learns that Guruji has all the signs of Aadi Guru, the deity worshiped by the tribe for many years. Thus, the Tibru tribe becomes civilised by Guruji and abandons their practice of hunting and killing animals for food. Suddenly, the head of the 16 tribes, Ajgar, demands a sacrifice. When Guruji asks the tribe to refuse, he learns that they oppose civilised people and that Ajgar saved them from civilised people. When asked why they hate people who live in cities, Babru states city-dwellers are successors to Eklavya's tribe. As Guru Dakshina, Eklavya was a renowned Archer who gave his thumb, but could not earn respect for his tribe. His forefathers tell him not to worry and say that during Kalyuga there will be a man who will bring respect to the tribe. On Guruji's insistence, the tribe refuses to offer a sacrifice. On hearing this, Ajgar is enraged and takes the whole tribe as his hostage, but Guruji saves them. Soon Ajgar realizes that Guruji is no ordinary man and that the army might kill him. His own tribe seems to be against him, as the army is about to enter the area to kill the tribe, as they had been labeled as antisocial terrorists. It seems wise to surrender his life to the army rather than risk his entire tribe. He asks for pardon from Guruji for his deeds and runs away, saying that he is going to surrender himself, but when the army takes him as a hostage, Guruji arrives and fights the entire army by himself. Durjan Singh suddenly arrives and tells Guruji how he tried multiple times to prevent the minister from instigating the army into believing that the primitive tribe is its biggest enemy. They were even trying to take Guruji's life but failed miserably because of Guruji. At this point the army realizes that Durjan Singh is misleading them and that Guruji is the man \"Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan\" who has been donating blood to the army, eyes to the old parents of army officers, even kidneys to the needy army personnel. They ask Guruji to forgive them, and Durjan Singh once again is defeated by Guruji's noble deeds.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] as Guru Ji\n* [[Arpit Ranka]] as Azgar\n* [[Honeypreet Insan]] as Parimeet Insan\n* Charanpreet Insan as Fairymeet Insan\n* Rohit Khurana as Arjun\n* Sukhwinder Singh as Durjan Singh\n* Rooh-E-Meet as Ajij Khan\n* Sahil Insan as DGP\n* Shan-E-Meet as Pyardeep Kumar Insan\n* Kaynat Toor as Chabuki<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4921860/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=MSG 2 the Messenger|date=18 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Filming==\nThe film was principally filmed in Bhangarh, Rajasthan.<ref>{{Cite web|title = MSG 2: 4 reasons that make it a must-watch|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/msg-2-4-reasons-that-make-it-a-must-watch/story-aUHSvd99V2tTM2v0WHRrCP.html|website = http://www.hindustantimes.com/|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\nA preview poster for the film was released at Shah Satnam Ji Cricket Stadium on 15 August 2015 before an estimated 278,000 attendees celebrating India's Independence Day.<ref>{{Cite news|title = dera sacha sauda chief film msg2 first look poster is released : \u092e\u0942\u0935\u0940 \u092e\u0938\u093e\u0932\u093e: \u0906\u091c \u0924\u0915|url = http://aajtak.intoday.in/story/dera-sacha-sauda-chief-film-msg2-first-look-poster-is-released--1-828469.html|work = Aaj Tak|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}</ref>  A number of world and regional records were organized by sect leader Ram Rahim to promote the film.

An army is deployed to repel the so-called terrorists, but after some of the army's soldiers are killed by the Ace Archers, the army plans a mission that will remove the primitive people. Guruji dislikes the idea of declaring the primitive people terrorists. According to Guruji, all people are humans, and no inhumane treatment is justified. He believes that even if the local primitive people behave in an uncivilised way, they are not animals, and that every person has the ability to be transformed by love and affection. Even though the primitive people endanger Guruji's life, Guruji decides to advocate for them. A police inspector named Arjun attacks the primitive people, but Guruji saves him after he is badly injured. Arjun goes to meet Guruji with Babru. Guruji also saves the life of the Tibru tribe's leader, Babru's son, and gains his confidence. Babru learns that Guruji has all the signs of Aadi Guru, the deity worshiped by the tribe for many years. Thus, the Tibru tribe becomes civilised by Guruji and abandons their practice of hunting and killing animals for food. Suddenly, the head of the 16 tribes, Ajgar, demands a sacrifice. When Guruji asks the tribe to refuse, he learns that they oppose civilised people and that Ajgar saved them from civilised people. When asked why they hate people who live in cities, Babru states city-dwellers are successors to Eklavya's tribe. As Guru Dakshina, Eklavya was a renowned Archer who gave his thumb, but could not earn respect for his tribe. His forefathers tell him not to worry and say that during Kalyuga there will be a man who will bring respect to the tribe. On Guruji's insistence, the tribe refuses to offer a sacrifice. On hearing this, Ajgar is enraged and takes the whole tribe as his hostage, but Guruji saves them. Soon Ajgar realizes that Guruji is no ordinary man and that the army might kill him. His own tribe seems to be against him, as the army is about to enter the area to kill the tribe, as they had been labeled as antisocial terrorists. It seems wise to surrender his life to the army rather than risk his entire tribe. He asks for pardon from Guruji for his deeds and runs away, saying that he is going to surrender himself, but when the army takes him as a hostage, Guruji arrives and fights the entire army by himself. Durjan Singh suddenly arrives and tells Guruji how he tried multiple times to prevent the minister from instigating the army into believing that the primitive tribe is its biggest enemy. They were even trying to take Guruji's life but failed miserably because of Guruji. At this point the army realizes that Durjan Singh is misleading them and that Guruji is the man \"Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan\" who has been donating blood to the army, eyes to the old parents of army officers, even kidneys to the needy army personnel. They ask Guruji to forgive them, and Durjan Singh once again is defeated by Guruji's noble deeds.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]] as Guru Ji\n* [[Arpit Ranka]] as Azgar\n* [[Honeypreet Insan]] as Parimeet Insan\n* Charanpreet Insan as Fairymeet Insan\n* Rohit Khurana as Arjun\n* Sukhwinder Singh as Durjan Singh\n* Rooh-E-Meet as Ajij Khan\n* Sahil Insan as DGP\n* Shan-E-Meet as Pyardeep Kumar Insan\n* Kaynat Toor as Chabuki<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4921860/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=MSG 2 the Messenger|date=18 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Filming==\nThe film was principally filmed in Bhangarh, Rajasthan.<ref>{{Cite web|title = MSG 2: 4 reasons that make it a must-watch|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/msg-2-4-reasons-that-make-it-a-must-watch/story-aUHSvd99V2tTM2v0WHRrCP.html|website = http://www.hindustantimes.com/|accessdate = 2015-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\nA preview poster for the film was released at Shah Satnam Ji Cricket Stadium on 15 August 2015 before an estimated 278,000 attendees celebrating India's Independence Day.<ref>{{Cite news|title = dera sacha sauda chief film msg2 first look poster is released : \u092e\u0942\u0935\u0940 \u092e\u0938\u093e\u0932\u093e: \u0906\u091c \u0924\u0915|url = http://aajtak.intoday.in/story/dera-sacha-sauda-chief-film-msg2-first-look-poster-is-released--1-828469.html|work = Aaj Tak|accessdate = 2015-08-21}}</ref>  A number of world and regional records were organized by sect leader Ram Rahim to promote the film.

Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of [[plain text]] for storing data; a hierarchical [[file system]]; treating devices and certain types of [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of [[programming tool|software tools]], small programs that can be strung together through a [[command-line interpreter]] using [[pipeline (Unix)|pipes]], as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality.  These concepts are collectively known as the \"[[Unix philosophy]]\".  [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Rob Pike]] summarize this in ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' as \"the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\".<ref>Kernighan, Brian W. Pike, Rob. ''The UNIX Programming Environment.'' 1984. viii</ref>\n\nIn an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a [[data terminal]] for [[Input/output|input and output]] (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as I/O was generally linear.  In the 1980s, [[non-blocking I/O]] and the set of [[inter-process communication]] mechanisms were augmented with [[Unix domain socket]]s, [[shared memory]], [[message queue]]s, and [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], as well as [[network socket]]s to support communication with other hosts. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a [[computer mouse|mouse]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=January 30, 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | page=132}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |quote=The best thing about UNIX is its portability.

The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the [[file system]] and other common \"low-level\" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously.

In the late 1980s, AT&T [[Unix System Laboratories]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] developed System&nbsp;V Release&nbsp;4 ([[SVR4]]), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors.\n\nIn the 1990s, Unix and Unix-like systems grew in popularity as BSD and [[Linux]] distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers.

In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the [[Single UNIX Specification]] (SUS) administered by [[The Open Group]]. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the [[Austin Group]], to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.\n\nIn 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.\n\nThe [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]] was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.\n\n== Components ==\n{{see also|List of Unix commands}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2017|section}}\n\nThe Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.{{according to whom|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe inclusion of these components did not make the system large{{snd}} the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10&nbsp;MB and arrived on a single nine-track [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]]. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.\n\nThe names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many{{who|date=February 2014}} to have the canonical early structure:\n* ''Kernel''{{snd}} source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:\n** ''conf''{{snd}} configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code\n** ''dev''{{snd}} device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware)\n** ''sys''{{snd}} operating system \"kernel\", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.\n** ''h''{{snd}} header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables\n* ''Development environment''{{snd}} early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:\n** ''cc''{{snd}} [[C (programming language)|C language]] compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix)\n** ''as''{{snd}} machine-language assembler for the machine\n** ''ld''{{snd}} linker, for combining object files\n** ''lib''{{snd}} object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). ''[[libc]]'', the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for things such as mathematical functions (''[[libm]]'') or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern \"Standard I/O\" library ''stdio'' as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.\n** ''[[make (software)|make]]''{{snd}} build manager (introduced in [[PWB/UNIX]]), for effectively automating the build process\n** ''include''{{snd}} header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants\n** ''Other languages''{{snd}} V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (''bc'', ''dc''), and the [[awk]] scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.\n** ''Other tools''{{snd}} including an object-code archive manager (''ar''), symbol-table lister (''nm''), compiler-development tools (e.g. ''[[Lex (software)|lex]]'' & ''[[yacc]]''), and debugging tools.\n* ''Commands''{{snd}} Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. ''[[cron]]''), commands of general utility (e.g. ''[[grep]]''), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:\n** ''[[Bourne shell|sh]]''{{snd}} the \"shell\" programmable [[command-line interpreter]], the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a \"command window\").\n** ''Utilities''{{snd}} the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including ''[[cp (Unix)|cp]]'', ''[[ls]]'', ''[[grep]]'', ''[[find (Unix)|find]]'' and many others. Subcategories include:\n*** ''System utilities''{{snd}} administrative tools such as ''[[mkfs]]'', ''[[fsck]]'', and many others.\n*** ''User utilities''{{snd}} environment management tools such as ''passwd'', ''kill'', and others.\n** ''Document formatting''{{snd}} Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as ''[[nroff]]'', ''[[troff]]'', ''[[tbl]]'', ''[[eqn (software)|eqn]]'', ''[[refer (software)|refer]]'', and ''[[Pic language|pic]]''. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as [[TeX]] and [[Ghostscript]].\n** ''Graphics''{{snd}} the ''plot'' subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device-specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include [[X11]] as a standard windowing system and [[GUI]], and many support [[OpenGL]].\n** ''Communications''{{snd}} early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs ''mail'' and ''write''. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system [[UUCP]], and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included [[TCP/IP]] utilities.\n* ''Documentation''{{snd}} Unix was the first{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:\n** ''[[man page|man]]''{{snd}} manual pages for each command, library component, [[system call]], header file, etc.\n** ''doc''{{snd}} longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff\n\n== Impact ==\n{{See also|Unix-like}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]], principal developers of [[Research Unix]]]]\n[[File:Usenix84 1.jpg|thumb|Photo from [[USENIX]] 1984, including [[Dennis Ritchie]] (center)]]\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (with acme).png|thumb|[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] extends Unix design principles and was developed as a successor to Unix.]]\n\nThe Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in [[assembly language]], but was soon rewritten in [[C (programming language)|C]], a [[high-level programming language]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ritchie, Dennis |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |title=The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System |year=1979 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |publisher=Bell Labs |quote=Perhaps the most important watershed occurred during 1973, when the operating system kernel was rewritten in C. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611114353/https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although this followed the lead of [[Multics]] and [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs]], it was Unix that popularized the idea.\n\nUnix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]], [[computer terminal|terminals]], or [[disk drive]]s), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as [[ioctl]] and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple \"stream of bytes\" model. The [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.\n\nUnix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's [[RSX-11]]M's \"group, user\" hierarchy evolved into [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] directories, [[CP/M]]'s volumes evolved into [[MS-DOS]] 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's [[HP Multi-Programming Executive|MPE]] group.account hierarchy and IBM's [[System Support Program|SSP]] and [[OS/400]] library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.\n\nMaking the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The [[Unix shell]] used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting ([[shell script]]s&nbsp;\u2013 there was no separate job control language like IBM's [[Job Control Language|JCL]]). Since the shell and OS commands were \"just another program\", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes ([[pipeline (Unix)|pipelines]]) made a powerful programming paradigm ([[coroutine]]s) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.\n\nA fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on [[newline]]-[[Delimiter|delimited]] text for nearly all file formats. There were no \"binary\" editors in the original version of Unix&nbsp;\u2013 the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte&nbsp;\u2013 unlike [[Record-oriented filesystem|\"record-based\" file systems]]. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ''ad hoc'' tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages ([[PostScript]], [[ODF]]), and at the application layer of the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]], e.g., [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[SOAP]], and [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]].\n\nUnix popularized a syntax for [[regular expression]]s that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.\n\nEarly Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and [[reusability]] into [[software engineering]] practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the [[Unix philosophy]].\n\nThe [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP networking protocols]] were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the [[Internet]] explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.\n\nThe Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the [[free software movement]] in 1983.\n\nsubject/reference=== Free Unix and Unix-like variants ===\n{{See also|Operating system#Unix and Unix-like operating systems}}\n{{Multiple image\n | width = 220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1 = Debian 6.0 Console Login.png\n | image2 = FreeBSD 9.1 Console Login.png\n | footer = Console screenshots of [[Debian]] (top, a popular [[Linux distribution]]) and [[FreeBSD]] (bottom, a popular [[Unix-like]] operating system)\n}}\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]] announced the [[GNU]] (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a [[free software]] [[Unix-like]] system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, [[GNU Hurd]], had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 [[Linus Torvalds]] released the kernel [[Linux kernel|Linux]] as free software under the [[GNU General Public License]]. In addition to their use in the [[GNU]] operating system, many GNU packages&nbsp;\u2013 such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (and the rest of the [[GNU toolchain]]), the [[glibc|GNU C library]] and the [[Coreutils|GNU core utilities]]&nbsp;\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\n[[Linux distribution]]s, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[SUSE Linux|SUSE Linux Enterprise]], [[openSUSE]], [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Linux Mint]], [[Mandriva Linux]], [[Slackware Linux]], [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major| title=Distrowatch: Top Ten Distributions}}</ref>\n\nA free derivative of [[BSD]] Unix, [[386BSD]], was released in 1992 and led to the [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]] projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (''[[USL v. BSDi]]'') by [[Unix System Laboratories]], it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including [[OpenBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]].\n\nLinux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:<ref name=\"Interview_1999\">{{cite web|author=Benet, Manuel|url=http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html|title=Interview With Dennis M.

Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.}}\n\nIn the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago\".<ref name=\"Interview_1999\" />\n\n[[OpenSolaris]] was the open-source counterpart to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], which included a [[CDDL]]-licensed kernel and a primarily [[GNU]] userland. However, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the [[illumos]] kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.\n\n=== ARPANET ===\nIn May 1975, RFC 681 described the development of ''Network Unix'' by the Center for Advanced Computation at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. The system was said to \"present several interesting capabilities as an [[ARPANET]] mini-host\". At the time Unix required a license from [[Bell Laboratories]] that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non-[[university]] users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was \"open to suggestions\" for an ARPANET-wide license.\n\nSpecific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, [[compiler]]s, [[Text editor|editors]], a [[roff (software)|document preparation system]]<!--Correct link?-->, efficient file system and access control, [[Mount (computing)|mountable]] and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as [[Device file system|special files]], integration of the [[Network Control Program|network control program]] (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of [[Connection-oriented protocol|network connections]] as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix [[System call|I/O calls]], closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be \"desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel\".\n\n== Branding ==\n{{See also|List of Unix systems}}\n[[File:UNIX-Licence-Plate.JPG|thumb|Promotional [[license plate]] by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]]]\n[[File:HP-HP9000-C110-Workstation 10.jpg|thumb|[[HP9000]] [[workstation]] running [[HP-UX]], a certified Unix operating system]]\n\nIn October 1993, [[Novell]], the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the [[trademark]]s of Unix to the X/Open Company (now [[The Open Group]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" >{{cite newsgroup |title=The name UNIX is now the property of X/Open |author=Chuck Karish |date=October 12, 1993 |newsgroup=comp.std.unix |message-id=29hug3INN4qt@rodan.UU.NET |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.unix/msg/c9974cf0022884f8 |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> and in 1995 sold the related business operations to [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |title=HP, Novell and SCO To Deliver High-Volume UNIX OS With Advanced Network And Enterprise Services |publisher=Novell.com |date=September 20, 1995 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123203442/http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Whether Novell also sold the [[copyright]]s to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, ''[[SCO v.

Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of [[plain text]] for storing data; a hierarchical [[file system]]; treating devices and certain types of [[inter-process communication]] (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of [[programming tool|software tools]], small programs that can be strung together through a [[command-line interpreter]] using [[pipeline (Unix)|pipes]], as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality.  These concepts are collectively known as the \"[[Unix philosophy]]\".  [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Rob Pike]] summarize this in ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' as \"the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\".<ref>Kernighan, Brian W. Pike, Rob. ''The UNIX Programming Environment.'' 1984. viii</ref>\n\nIn an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a [[data terminal]] for [[Input/output|input and output]] (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as I/O was generally linear.  In the 1980s, [[non-blocking I/O]] and the set of [[inter-process communication]] mechanisms were augmented with [[Unix domain socket]]s, [[shared memory]], [[message queue]]s, and [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], as well as [[network socket]]s to support communication with other hosts. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a [[computer mouse|mouse]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=January 30, 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | page=132}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |quote=The best thing about UNIX is its portability.

The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the [[file system]] and other common \"low-level\" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously.

In 2000, Apple released [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], also a Unix system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, which was later renamed [[macOS]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH207-BCICAIFJ\n |title       = Loading\n |publisher   = Developer.apple.com\n |accessdate  = August 22, 2012\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/68BcbgbEj?url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/SystemTechnology.html\n |archivedate = June 5, 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nUnix operating systems are widely used in modern [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[workstation]]s, and [[mobile device]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asymco.com/2010/09/29/unixs-revenge/ |title=Unix's Revenge |publisher=asymco |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109010117/http://www.asymco.com/2010/09/29/unixs-revenge/ |archivedate=November 9, 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\n[[File:CDE 2012 on Linux.png|thumb|The [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE), part of the [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE initiative]]]]\n\nIn the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as [[POSIX]] provided a common baseline for all operating systems; [[IEEE]] based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the [[Single UNIX Specification]] (SUS) administered by [[The Open Group]]. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the [[Austin Group]], to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.\n\nIn 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's [[Executable and Linkable Format]] (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.\n\nThe [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]] was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.\n\n== Components ==\n{{see also|List of Unix commands}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2017|section}}\n\nThe Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.{{according to whom|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe inclusion of these components did not make the system large{{snd}} the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10&nbsp;MB and arrived on a single nine-track [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]]. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.\n\nThe names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many{{who|date=February 2014}} to have the canonical early structure:\n* ''Kernel''{{snd}} source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:\n** ''conf''{{snd}} configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code\n** ''dev''{{snd}} device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware)\n** ''sys''{{snd}} operating system \"kernel\", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.\n** ''h''{{snd}} header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables\n* ''Development environment''{{snd}} early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:\n** ''cc''{{snd}} [[C (programming language)|C language]] compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix)\n** ''as''{{snd}} machine-language assembler for the machine\n** ''ld''{{snd}} linker, for combining object files\n** ''lib''{{snd}} object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). ''[[libc]]'', the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for things such as mathematical functions (''[[libm]]'') or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern \"Standard I/O\" library ''stdio'' as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.\n** ''[[make (software)|make]]''{{snd}} build manager (introduced in [[PWB/UNIX]]), for effectively automating the build process\n** ''include''{{snd}} header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants\n** ''Other languages''{{snd}} V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (''bc'', ''dc''), and the [[awk]] scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.\n** ''Other tools''{{snd}} including an object-code archive manager (''ar''), symbol-table lister (''nm''), compiler-development tools (e.g. ''[[Lex (software)|lex]]'' & ''[[yacc]]''), and debugging tools.\n* ''Commands''{{snd}} Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. ''[[cron]]''), commands of general utility (e.g. ''[[grep]]''), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:\n** ''[[Bourne shell|sh]]''{{snd}} the \"shell\" programmable [[command-line interpreter]], the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a \"command window\").\n** ''Utilities''{{snd}} the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including ''[[cp (Unix)|cp]]'', ''[[ls]]'', ''[[grep]]'', ''[[find (Unix)|find]]'' and many others. Subcategories include:\n*** ''System utilities''{{snd}} administrative tools such as ''[[mkfs]]'', ''[[fsck]]'', and many others.\n*** ''User utilities''{{snd}} environment management tools such as ''passwd'', ''kill'', and others.\n** ''Document formatting''{{snd}} Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as ''[[nroff]]'', ''[[troff]]'', ''[[tbl]]'', ''[[eqn (software)|eqn]]'', ''[[refer (software)|refer]]'', and ''[[Pic language|pic]]''. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as [[TeX]] and [[Ghostscript]].\n** ''Graphics''{{snd}} the ''plot'' subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device-specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include [[X11]] as a standard windowing system and [[GUI]], and many support [[OpenGL]].\n** ''Communications''{{snd}} early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs ''mail'' and ''write''. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system [[UUCP]], and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included [[TCP/IP]] utilities.\n* ''Documentation''{{snd}} Unix was the first{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:\n** ''[[man page|man]]''{{snd}} manual pages for each command, library component, [[system call]], header file, etc.\n** ''doc''{{snd}} longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff\n\n== Impact ==\n{{See also|Unix-like}}\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]], principal developers of [[Research Unix]]]]\n[[File:Usenix84 1.jpg|thumb|Photo from [[USENIX]] 1984, including [[Dennis Ritchie]] (center)]]\n[[File:Plan 9 from Bell Labs (with acme).png|thumb|[[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]] extends Unix design principles and was developed as a successor to Unix.]]\n\nThe Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in [[assembly language]], but was soon rewritten in [[C (programming language)|C]], a [[high-level programming language]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ritchie, Dennis |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |title=The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System |year=1979 |accessdate=April 30, 2016 |publisher=Bell Labs |quote=Perhaps the most important watershed occurred during 1973, when the operating system kernel was rewritten in C. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611114353/https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although this followed the lead of [[Multics]] and [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs]], it was Unix that popularized the idea.\n\nUnix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]], [[computer terminal|terminals]], or [[disk drive]]s), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as [[ioctl]] and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple \"stream of bytes\" model. The [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.\n\nUnix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's [[RSX-11]]M's \"group, user\" hierarchy evolved into [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] directories, [[CP/M]]'s volumes evolved into [[MS-DOS]] 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's [[HP Multi-Programming Executive|MPE]] group.account hierarchy and IBM's [[System Support Program|SSP]] and [[OS/400]] library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.\n\nMaking the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The [[Unix shell]] used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting ([[shell script]]s&nbsp;\u2013 there was no separate job control language like IBM's [[Job Control Language|JCL]]). Since the shell and OS commands were \"just another program\", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes ([[pipeline (Unix)|pipelines]]) made a powerful programming paradigm ([[coroutine]]s) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.\n\nA fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on [[newline]]-[[Delimiter|delimited]] text for nearly all file formats. There were no \"binary\" editors in the original version of Unix&nbsp;\u2013 the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte&nbsp;\u2013 unlike [[Record-oriented filesystem|\"record-based\" file systems]]. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ''ad hoc'' tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages ([[PostScript]], [[ODF]]), and at the application layer of the [[Internet Protocol Suite|Internet protocols]], e.g., [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[SOAP]], and [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]].\n\nUnix popularized a syntax for [[regular expression]]s that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.\n\nEarly Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of [[Modularity (programming)|modularity]] and [[reusability]] into [[software engineering]] practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the [[Unix philosophy]].\n\nThe [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP networking protocols]] were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the [[Internet]] explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.\n\nThe Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the [[free software movement]] in 1983.\n\n=== Free Unix and Unix-like variants ===\n{{See also|Operating system#Unix and Unix-like operating systems}}\n{{Multiple image\n | width = 220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1 = Debian 6.0 Console Login.png\n | image2 = FreeBSD 9.1 Console Login.png\n | footer = Console screenshots of [[Debian]] (top, a popular [[Linux distribution]]) and [[FreeBSD]] (bottom, a popular [[Unix-like]] operating system)\n}}\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]] announced the [[GNU]] (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a [[free software]] [[Unix-like]] system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, [[GNU Hurd]], had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 [[Linus Torvalds]] released the kernel [[Linux kernel|Linux]] as free software under the [[GNU General Public License]]. In addition to their use in the [[GNU]] operating system, many GNU packages&nbsp;\u2013 such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (and the rest of the [[GNU toolchain]]), the [[glibc|GNU C library]] and the [[Coreutils|GNU core utilities]]&nbsp;\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\n\n[[Linux distribution]]s, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[SUSE Linux|SUSE Linux Enterprise]], [[openSUSE]], [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Linux Mint]], [[Mandriva Linux]], [[Slackware Linux]], [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major| title=Distrowatch: Top Ten Distributions}}</ref>\n\nA free derivative of [[BSD]] Unix, [[386BSD]], was released in 1992 and led to the [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]] projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (''[[USL v. BSDi]]'') by [[Unix System Laboratories]], it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including [[OpenBSD]] and [[DragonFly BSD]].\n\nLinux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:<ref name=\"Interview_1999\">{{cite web|author=Benet, Manuel|url=http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html|title=Interview With Dennis M.

Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers.}}\n\nIn the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago\".<ref name=\"Interview_1999\" />\n\n[[OpenSolaris]] was the open-source counterpart to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] developed by [[Sun Microsystems]], which included a [[CDDL]]-licensed kernel and a primarily [[GNU]] userland. However, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the [[illumos]] kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.\n\n=== ARPANET ===\nIn May 1975, RFC 681 described the development of ''Network Unix'' by the Center for Advanced Computation at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]. The system was said to \"present several interesting capabilities as an [[ARPANET]] mini-host\". At the time Unix required a license from [[Bell Laboratories]] that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non-[[university]] users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was \"open to suggestions\" for an ARPANET-wide license.\n\nSpecific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, [[compiler]]s, [[Text editor|editors]], a [[roff (software)|document preparation system]]<!--Correct link?-->, efficient file system and access control, [[Mount (computing)|mountable]] and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as [[Device file system|special files]], integration of the [[Network Control Program|network control program]] (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of [[Connection-oriented protocol|network connections]] as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix [[System call|I/O calls]], closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be \"desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel\".\n\n== Branding ==\n{{See also|List of Unix systems}}\n[[File:UNIX-Licence-Plate.JPG|thumb|Promotional [[license plate]] by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]]]\n[[File:HP-HP9000-C110-Workstation 10.jpg|thumb|[[HP9000]] [[workstation]] running [[HP-UX]], a certified Unix operating system]]\n\nIn October 1993, [[Novell]], the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the [[trademark]]s of Unix to the X/Open Company (now [[The Open Group]]),<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" >{{cite newsgroup |title=The name UNIX is now the property of X/Open |author=Chuck Karish |date=October 12, 1993 |newsgroup=comp.std.unix |message-id=29hug3INN4qt@rodan.UU.NET |url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.unix/msg/c9974cf0022884f8 |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> and in 1995 sold the related business operations to [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |title=HP, Novell and SCO To Deliver High-Volume UNIX OS With Advanced Network And Enterprise Services |publisher=Novell.com |date=September 20, 1995 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123203442/http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/1995/09/pr95220.html |archivedate=January 23, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Whether Novell also sold the [[copyright]]s to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, ''[[SCO v.

Most common is the conventional ''Unixes'', but ''Unices'', treating Unix as a [[Latin]] noun of the [[Latin declension#Third declension (i)|third declension]], is also popular. The pseudo-[[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] plural form ''Unixen'' is not common, although occasionally seen. [[Sun Microsystems]], developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term ''Unix'' is itself plural, referencing its many implementations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cse.unl.edu/~witty/class/csce351/howto/history_of_solaris.pdf|title=History of Solaris|quote=UNIX is plural.
