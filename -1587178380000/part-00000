The area between opposing trench lines (known as \"[[no man's land]]\") was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides. Attacks, even if successful, often sustained severe casualties.\n\nWith the development of [[armoured warfare]] and [[combined arms]] tactics, emphasis on trench warfare has declined, but it still occurs wherever battle lines become static.\n\n==Overview== \n\n===Field works===\n[[File:Lines of Torres Vedras.jpg|thumb|Lines of Torres Vedras]]\nField works are as old as armies.

Attacks across open ground became even more dangerous after the introduction of rapid-firing [[artillery]], exemplified by the [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897|\"French 75\"]], and [[high explosive]] [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] rounds. The increases in firepower had outstripped the ability of [[infantry]] (or even  [[cavalry]]) to cover the ground between firing lines, and the ability of armour to withstand fire. It would take a revolution in mobility to change that.<ref >Dyer, Gwynn. ''War''; Dupuy, Trevor N. ''Evolution of Weapons and Warfare''</ref>\n\nTrench warfare became archetypically associated with the [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), when the [[Race to the Sea]] rapidly expanded trench use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] starting in September 1914.<ref name=\"Ellis, p 10\">{{harvnb|Ellis|1977|p=10}}.</ref> By the end of October 1914, the whole front in Belgium and France had solidified into lines of trenches, which lasted until the last weeks of the war.  Mass infantry assaults were futile in the face of artillery fire, as well as rapid rifle and machine-gun fire. Both sides concentrated on breaking up enemy attacks and on protecting their own troops by digging deep into the ground.{{sfn|Ellis|1977|p=4}} Trench warfare also took place on other [[Front (military)|front]]s, including in [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italy]] and at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].\n\n[[File:Boer Trench.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Boer]] trench at the [[Battle of Magersfontein]] contributed to the surprise defeat of the Highland Brigade on 11 December 1899 during the [[Second Boer War]]]]\n\n===Symbol for the futility of war===\nTrench warfare has become a powerful symbol of the futility of war.<ref name=g4>{{harvnb|Griffith|1996|p=4}}.</ref> Its image is of young men going \"over the top\" (over the parapet of the trench, to attack the enemy trench line) into a maelstrom of fire leading to near-certain death, typified by the [[First day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme]] (on which the British Army suffered nearly 60,000 casualties) or the grinding slaughter in the mud of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]].{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=24}} To the French, the equivalent is the attrition of the [[Battle of Verdun]] in which the [[French Army]] suffered 380,000 casualties.<ref>Lavalle, John in ''World War I \u2013 a student encyclopaedia'', ABC-Clio, 2006, p. 1886</ref>\n\nTrench warfare is associated with mass slaughter in appalling conditions. Many critics have argued that brave men went to their deaths because of incompetent and narrow-minded commanders who failed to adapt to the new conditions of trench warfare: class-ridden and backward-looking generals put their faith in the attack, believing superior morale and dash would overcome the weapons and moral inferiority of the defender.{{sfn|Ellis|1977|pp=80\u201387}} British public opinion often repeated the theme that their soldiers were  \"[[lions led by donkeys]]\".{{sfn|Griffith|1996|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nWorld War I generals are often portrayed as callously persisting in repeated hopeless attacks against trenches. There were failures such as Passchendaele, and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] has often been criticised for allowing his battles to continue long after they had lost any purpose other than attrition.{{sfn|Griffith|1996|p= 10}} Haig's defenders counter that the attrition was necessary in order to cause attrition in the German army.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carter Malkasian|title=A History of Modern Wars of Attrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xxu2iEEKi-IC&pg=PA40|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|page=40|isbn=9780275973797}}</ref>\n\nThe problems of trench warfare were recognised, and attempts were made to address them. These included improvements in artillery, infantry tactics, and the development of [[Tanks in World War I|tanks]]. By 1918, taking advantage of failing German morale, Allied attacks were generally more successful and suffered fewer casualties; in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], there was even a return to mobile warfare.\n\n==World War I: Entrenchment==\nTrench warfare in 1914-17 provided a very high degree of defence. According to two historians:\n:Trenches were longer, deeper, and better defended by steel, concrete, and barbed wire than ever before. They were far stronger and more effective than chains of forts, for they formed a continuous network, sometimes with four or five parallel lines linked by interfacings. They were dug far below the surface of the earth out of reach of the heaviest artillery....Grand battles with the old maneuvers were out of the question. Only by bombardment, sapping, and assault could the enemy be shaken, and such operations had to be conducted on an immense scale to produce appreciable results. Indeed, it is questionable whether the German lines in France could ever have been broken if the Germans had not wasted their resources in unsuccessful assaults, and the blockade by sea had not gradually cut off their supplies. In such warfare no single general could strike a blow that would make him immortal; the \"glory of fighting\" sank down into the dirt and mire of trenches and dugouts.<ref>[[James Harvey Robinson]] and [[Charles A.

The French and German armies adopted different [[Military tactics|tactical doctrines]]: the French relied on the attack with speed and surprise, and the Germans relied on [[firepower]], investing heavily in [[howitzer]]s and [[machine gun]]s.

They required a deliberate approach to seizing positions from which fire support could be given for the next phase of the attack, rather than a rapid move to break the enemy's line.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|p=27}} It was assumed that artillery could still destroy entrenched troops, or at least suppress them sufficiently for friendly infantry and cavalry to manoeuvre.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|pp=24\u201325}}\n\n[[File:French trench battle.jpg|thumb|French Trench in northeastern France]]\nDigging-in when defending a position was a standard practice by the start of WWI. To [[frontal assault|attack frontally]] was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy. After the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] in September 1914, an extended series of attempted flanking moves, and matching extensions to the fortified defensive lines, developed into the \"[[Race to the Sea|race to the sea]]\", by the end of which German and Allied armies had produced a matched pair of trench lines from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] border in the south to the [[North Sea]] coast of Belgium.\n\nArmies were also limited by logistics. The heavy use of artillery meant that ammunition expenditure was far higher in WWI than in any previous conflict. Horses and carts were insufficient for transporting large quantities over long distances, so armies had trouble moving far from railheads. This greatly slowed advances, making it impossible for either side to achieve a breakthrough that would change the war. This situation would only be altered in WWII with greater use of motorized vehicles.<ref>Van Creveld, p. 109-41</ref>\n\nTrench warfare prevailed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] from late 1914 until the Germans launched their [[Operation Michael|Spring Offensive]] on 21 March 1918. After the buildup of forces in 1915, the Western Front became a stalemated struggle between equals, to be decided by attrition. Frontal assaults, and their associated casualties, became inevitable because the continuous trench lines had no open flanks. Casualties of the defenders matched those of the attackers, as vast reserves were expended in costly counter-attacks or exposed to the attacker's massed artillery. There were periods in which rigid trench warfare broke down, such as during the [[Battle of the Somme]], but the lines never moved very far. The war would be won by the side that was able to commit the last reserves to the Western Front.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|pp=\u201325}}\n[[File:French army.jpg|thumb|left|Hot Shower-Bath establishment installed by an ingenious French engineer, November, 1914]]\nEarly World War I trenches were simple. They lacked [[Traverse (trench warfare)|traverses]], and according to pre-war doctrine were to be packed with men fighting shoulder to shoulder. This doctrine led to heavy casualties from artillery fire. This vulnerability, and the length of the front to be defended, soon led to front line trenches being held by fewer men. The defenders augmented the trenches themselves with barbed wire strung in front to impede movement; wiring parties went out every night to repair and improve these forward defences.{{sfn|Griffith|2004|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe small, improvised trenches of the first few months grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. They resisted both artillery bombardment and mass infantry assault. Shell-proof dugouts became a high priority.{{sfn|Griffith|2004|p=11}} The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as \"no man's land\" and varied in width depending on the battlefield. On the Western Front it was typically between {{convert|100|and|300|yd|m|order=flip|round=5}}, though only {{convert|30|yd|m|order=flip|round=5}} on [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]].\n\nAfter the German withdrawal to the [[Hindenburg line]] in March 1917, no man's land stretched to over a kilometre in places. At the \"[[Quinn's Post]]\" in the cramped confines of the Anzac battlefield at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], the opposing trenches were only {{convert|16|yd|m|order=flip}} apart and the soldiers in the trenches constantly threw [[hand grenade]]s at each other. On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and in the Middle East, the areas to be covered were so vast, and the distances from the factories supplying shells, bullets, concrete and barbed wire so great, trench warfare in the West European style often did not occur.\n\nIn the [[Alps]], trench warfare even stretched onto vertical slopes and deep into the mountains, to heights of {{convert|3900|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[Ortler]] had an artillery position on its summit near the front line. The trench-line management and trench profiles had to be adapted to the rough terrain, hard rock, and harsh weather conditions. Many trench systems were constructed within glaciers such as the [[Adamello-Presanella]] group or the famous city below the ice on the [[Marmolada]] in the [[Dolomites]].\n\n===Trench defensive systems===\nVery early in the war, British defensive doctrine suggested a main trench system of three parallel lines, interconnected by communications trenches. The point at which a communications trench intersected the front trench was of critical importance, and it was usually heavily fortified. The front trench was lightly garrisoned and typically only occupied in force during \"stand to\" at dawn and dusk. Between {{convert|70|and|100|yd|m|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} behind the front trench was located the support (or \"travel\") trench, to which the garrison would retreat when the front trench was bombarded.\n\nBetween {{convert|100|and|300|yd|m|order=flip|-1}} further to the rear was located the third reserve trench, where the reserve troops could amass for a counter-attack if the front trenches were captured. This defensive layout was soon rendered obsolete as the power of artillery grew; however, in certain sectors of the front, the support trench was maintained as a decoy to attract the enemy bombardment away from the front and reserve lines. Fires were lit in the support line to make it appear inhabited and any damage done immediately repaired.\n\n[[File:Aerial view Loos-Hulluch trench system July 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Aerial view of opposing trench lines between Loos and Hulluch, July 1917. German trenches at the right and bottom, British at the top-left.]]\nTemporary trenches were also built. When a major attack was planned, assembly trenches would be dug near the front trench. These were used to provide a sheltered place for the waves of attacking troops who would follow the first waves leaving from the front trench. \"Saps\" were temporary, unmanned, often dead-end utility trenches dug out into no-man's land. They fulfilled a variety of purposes, such as connecting the front trench to a listening post close to the enemy wire or providing an advance \"jumping-off\" line for a surprise attack. When one side's front line bulged towards the opposition, a [[Salient (military)|salient]] was formed. The concave trench line facing the salient was called a \"re-entrant.\" Large salients were perilous for their occupants because they could be assailed from three sides.\n\nBehind the front system of trenches there were usually at least two more partially prepared trench systems, kilometres to the rear, ready to be occupied in the event of a retreat. The Germans often prepared multiple redundant trench systems; in 1916 their [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] front featured two complete trench systems, one kilometre apart, with a third partially completed system a further kilometre behind. This duplication made a decisive breakthrough virtually impossible. In the event that a section of the first trench system was captured, a \"switch\" trench would be dug to connect the second trench system to the still-held section of the first.\n\nThe Germans, who had based their knowledge on studies of the [[Russo-Japanese War]],<ref name=\"Keegan, p. 179\">{{harvnb|Keegan|1999|p=179}}.</ref> made something of a science out of designing and constructing defensive works. They used reinforced concrete to construct deep, shell-proof, ventilated dugouts, as well as strategic strongpoints. They were more willing than their opponents to make a strategic withdrawal to a superior prepared defensive position. They were also the first to apply the concept of \"defence in depth\", where the front-line zone was hundreds of metres deep and contained a series of [[redoubt]]s rather than a continuous trench. Each redoubt could provide supporting fire to its neighbours, and while the attackers had freedom of movement between the redoubts, they would be subjected to withering [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire.\n\nThe British eventually adopted a similar approach, but it was incompletely implemented when the Germans launched the 1918 Spring Offensive and proved disastrously ineffective. France, by contrast, relied on artillery and reserves, not entrenchment. The characteristic barbed wire placed before trenches, in belts {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep or more, differed, too; the German wire was heavier gauge, and British wire cutters, designed for the thinner native product, were unable to cut it.<ref name=\"Canada's Army, p.79\">''Canada's Army'', p. 79.</ref>\n\nThe static movement of trench warfare and a need for protection from [[sniper]]s created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name=\"One\">[https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/ Trench Loopholes, Le Linge]</ref>  Often a steel plate was used with a \"key hole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n===Trench construction===\n[[File:Trench construction diagram 1914.png|thumb|Trench construction diagram from a 1914 British infantry manual]]\n[[File:Trench warfare.png|thumb|Soldiers training in trench warfare, with well-defined fire bays connected by offset traverse trenches, with zigzag communication trenches leading to the rear area]]\n\nA well-developed trench had to be at least {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} deep to allow men to walk upright and still be protected. Trenches were never straight but were dug in a [[zigzag]]ging or stepped pattern, with all straight sections generally kept less than a dozen meters (yards). Later, this evolved to have the combat trenches broken into distinct [[wikt:fire bay|fire bay]]s connected by traverses. While this isolated the view of friendly soldiers along their own trench, this ensured the entire trench could not be [[Enfilade and defilade|enfiladed]] if the enemy gained access at any one point; or if a bomb, grenade, or shell landed in the trench, the blast could not travel far.\n\nThe banked earth on the lip of the trench facing the enemy was called the [[parapet]] and had a fire step. The embanked rear lip of the trench was called the parados. The parados protected the soldier's back from shells falling behind the trench. The sides of the trench were often revetted with [[sandbag]]s, [[wire mesh]], wooden frames and sometimes roofs. The floor of the trench was usually covered by wooden [[duckboards]]. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath.\n\n[[Dugout (military)|Dugouts]] of varying degrees of comfort would be built in the rear of the support trench. British dugouts were usually {{convert|2.5|to|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} deep, whereas German dugouts were typically much deeper, usually a minimum of {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} deep and sometimes dug three stories down, with concrete staircases to reach the upper levels.\n\n[[File:Periscope rifle Gallipoli 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Australian light horse]]man using a [[periscope rifle]], Gallipoli 1915]]\nTo allow a soldier to see out of the trench without exposing his head, a loophole could be built into the parapet. A loophole might simply be a gap in the sandbags, or it might be fitted with a steel plate. German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the [[Periscope|trench periscope]] \u2013 in its simplest form, just a stick with two angled pieces of mirror at the top and bottom. A number of armies made use of the [[periscope rifle]], which enabled soldiers to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet, although at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy. The device is most associated with Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, where the [[Turkey|Turks]] held the high ground.\n\nThere were three standard ways to dig a trench: entrenching, sapping, and tunnelling. Entrenching, where a man would stand on the surface and dig downwards, was most efficient, as it allowed a large digging party to dig the full length of the trench simultaneously. However, entrenching left the diggers exposed above ground and hence could only be carried out when free of observation, such as in a rear area or at night. [[Sapping]] involved extending the trench by digging away at the end face. The diggers were not exposed, but only one or two men could work on the trench at a time.\n\nTunnelling was like sapping except that a \"roof\" of soil was left in place while the trench line was established and then removed when the trench was ready to be occupied. The guidelines for British trench construction stated that it would take 450 men 6 hours at night to complete {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} of front-line trench system. Thereafter, the trench would require constant maintenance to prevent deterioration caused by weather or shelling.\n\n[[File:Breastwork trench at Armentieres 1916.jpg|thumb|Breastwork \"trench\", Armenti\u00e8res, 1916]]\nThe battlefield of [[Flanders]] presented numerous problems for the practice of trench warfare, especially for the Allied forces, mainly British and Canadians, who were often compelled to occupy the low ground. Heavy shelling quickly destroyed the network of ditches and water channels which had previously drained this low-lying area of Belgium. In most places, the [[water table]] was only a metre or so below the surface, meaning that any trench dug in the ground would quickly flood.\n\nConsequently, many \"trenches\" in Flanders were actually above ground and constructed from massive breastworks of sandbags filled with clay. Initially, both the parapet and parados of the trench were built in this way, but a later technique was to dispense with the parados for much of the trench line, thus exposing the rear of the trench to fire from the reserve line in case the front was breached.\n\n===Trench geography in World War I===\nThe confined, static, and subterranean nature of trench warfare resulted in it developing its own peculiar form of [[geography]]. In the forward zone, the conventional transport infrastructure of roads and rail were replaced by the network of trenches and [[trench railways]]. The critical advantage that could be gained by holding the high ground meant that minor hills and ridges gained enormous significance. Many slight hills and valleys were so subtle as to have been nameless until the front line encroached upon them. Some hills were named for their height in metres, such as [[Battle of Hill 60 (Western Front)|Hill 60]]. A farmhouse, windmill, quarry, or copse of trees would become the focus of a determined struggle simply because it was the largest identifiable feature. However, it would not take the artillery long to obliterate it, so that thereafter it became just a name on a map.\n\nBattlefield features could be given a descriptive name (\"[[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]]\" near [[Ypres]] or \"[[Battle of Lone Pine|Lone Pine]]\"), a whimsical name (\"[[Sausage Valley]]\" and \"Mash Valley\" on the Somme), a unit name (\"Inniskilling Inch\" at Helles named for the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]) or the name of a soldier (\"Monash Valley\" at [[Anzac Cove|Anzac]] named after General [[John Monash]]). Prefixing a feature with \"Dead Man's\" was also popular for obvious reasons, such as \"Dead Man's Road\" leading in to Pozi\u00e8res, or \"Dead Man's Ridge\" at Anzac.\n\nThere were numerous trench networks named \"The Chessboard\" or \"The Gridiron\" because of the pattern they described. For the Australians at [[Battle of Mouquet Farm|Mouquet Farm]], the advances were so short and the terrain so featureless that they were reduced to naming their objectives as \"points\" on the map, such as \"Point 81\" and \"Point 55.\"\n\nEnemy trenches, which would become objectives in an attack, needed to be named as well. Many were named for some observed event such as \"German Officers' Trench\" at Anzac or \"Ration Trench\" on the Somme. The British gave an alcoholic flavour to the German trenches in front of Ginchy: \"Beer Trench\", \"Bitter Trench\", \"Hop Trench\", \"Ale Alley\", and \"Pilsen Trench.\" Other objectives were named according to their role in the trench system, such as the \"Switch Trench\" and \"Intermediate Trench\" on the Somme.\n\nSome sections of the British trench system read like a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board, with names such as \"Park Lane\" and \"Bond Street\". British regular divisions habitually named their trenches after units, which resulted in names such as \"Munster Alley\" ([[Royal Munster Fusiliers]]), \"Black Watch Alley\" ([[Black Watch|Black Watch Regiment]]) and \"Border Barricade\" ([[Border Regiment]]). The [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]]s tended to name features after soldiers (\"Plugge's Plateau\", \"Walker's Ridge\", \"Quinn's Post\", \"Johnston's Jolly\", \"Russell's Top\", \"Brind's Road\" and so forth).\n\n==World War I: Life in the trenches==\n[[File:Distribution de pinard.jpg|thumb|upright|Distribution of ''pinard'' (ration wine) in a French trench in winter, considered important for morale]]\n[[File:Studying French.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Studying French in the Trenches\", ''The Literary Digest'', October 20, 1917]]\n[[File:Barbier fran\u00e7ais tranch\u00e9es.jpg|thumb|A barber in a French trench]]\nAn individual unit's time in a front-line trench was usually brief; from as little as one day to as much as two weeks at a time before being relieved. The 31st Australian Battalion once spent 53 days in the line at [[Villers-Bretonneux]], but such a duration was a rare exception. The [[10th Battalion, CEF]], averaged front line tours of six days in 1915 and 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calgaryhighlanders.com/history/10th/history/1915.htm|title=1915 history|website=Calgaryhighlanders.com|accessdate=12 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708112043/http://calgaryhighlanders.com/history/10th/history/1915.htm|archive-date=2011-07-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe units who manned the front line trenches the longest were the [[Portuguese Expeditionary Corps]] from [[Portugal]] stationed in Northern France; unlike the other allies the Portuguese couldn't rotate units from the front lines due to lack of reinforcements sent from Portugal, nor could they replace the depleted units that lost manpower due to the war of attrition. With this rate of casualties and no reinforcements forthcoming most of the men were denied leave and had to serve long periods in the trenches with some units spending up to six consecutive months in the front line with little to no leave during that time.<ref> Rodrigues, Hugo.

The frequency of combat would increase for the units of the \"elite\" fighting divisions\u2014on the Allied side; the British regular divisions, the [[Canadian Corps]], the French XX Corps, and the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]]s.\n\nSome sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, making life in the trenches comparatively easy. When the [[I Anzac Corps]] first arrived in France in April 1916 after the evacuation of Gallipoli, they were sent to a relatively peaceful sector south of [[Armenti\u00e8res]] to \"acclimatise\". In contrast, some other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. On the Western Front, [[Ypres]] was invariably hellish, especially for the British in the exposed, overlooked salient. However, even quiet sectors amassed daily casualties through [[sniper]] fire, artillery,<!--can subsume \"mortar\" under arty, in context--> disease, and [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]]. In the first six months of 1916, before the launch of the [[Somme Offensive]], the British did not engage in any significant battles on their sector of the Western Front and yet suffered 107,776 casualties. Only 1 in 2 men would return alive and unwounded from the trenches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=YouTube is nothing like a RS}}\n\nA sector of the front would be allocated to an army [[corps]], usually comprising three [[division (military)|division]]s. Two divisions would occupy adjacent sections of the front, and the third would be in rest to the rear. This breakdown of duty would continue down through the army structure, so that within each front-line division, typically comprising three [[infantry]] [[brigade]]s (regiments for the Germans), two brigades would occupy the front and the third would be in reserve. Within each front-line brigade, typically comprising four [[battalion]]s, two battalions would occupy the front with two in reserve, and so on for companies and platoons. The lower down the structure this division of duty proceeded, the more frequently the units would rotate from front-line duty to support or reserve.\n\nDuring the day, snipers and [[artillery observer]]s in balloons made movement perilous, so the trenches were mostly quiet. It was during these daytime hours that the soldiers would amuse themselves with [[Trench Magazine|trench magazines]]. Because of the peril associated with daytime activities, trenches were busiest at night when the cover of darkness allowed movement of troops and supplies, the maintenance and expansion of the barbed wire and trench system, and reconnaissance of the enemy's defenses. Sentries in listening posts out in no man's land would try to detect enemy patrols and working parties, or indications that an attack was being prepared.\n\nPioneered by the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] in February 1915,<ref name=\"CanadasArmyp82\">''Canada's Army'', p. 82.</ref> [[Trench raiding|trench raid]]s were carried out in order to capture prisoners and \"booty\"&mdash;letters and other documents to provide intelligence about the unit occupying the opposing trenches. As the war progressed, raiding became part of the general British policy, the intention being to maintain the fighting spirit of the troops and to deny no man's land to the Germans. As well, they were intended to compel the enemy to reinforce, which exposed their troops to artillery fire.<ref name=\"CanadasArmyp82\"/>\n\nSuch dominance was achieved at a high cost when the enemy replied with their own artillery,<ref name=\"CanadasArmyp82\"/> and a post-war British analysis concluded the benefits were probably not worth the cost. Early in the war, surprise raids would be mounted, particularly by the Canadians, but increased vigilance made achieving surprise difficult as the war progressed. By 1916, raids were carefully planned exercises in combined arms and involved close co-operation between infantry and artillery.\n\nA raid would begin with an intense artillery bombardment designed to drive off or kill the front-trench garrison and cut the barbed wire. Then the bombardment would shift to form a \"box barrage\", or cordon, around a section of the front line to prevent a counter-attack intercepting the raid. However, the bombardment also had the effect of notifying the enemy of the location of the planned attack, thus allowing reinforcements to be called in from wider sectors.\n\n==World War I: Death and disease in the trenches==\n[[File:Captured World War I German machine gun position, Grevillers, France (21610477616).jpg|thumb|A German machine gun position just after its capture by New Zealand soldiers, with a dead German among the debris, [[Grevillers]], 24 August 1918, Hundred Days Offensive]]\n[[File:Stretcher bearers Passchendaele August 1917.jpg|thumb|Stretcher bearers, [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], August 1917]]\n[[File:NLS Haig - Smashed up German trench on Messines Ridge with dead.jpg|thumb|Dead German soldiers lie in the rubble of a trench destroyed by [[#Mining|mine explosion]], [[Messines Ridge]], 1917]]\n\nApproximately 10-15 percent of all fighting soldiers died during the First World War.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main contributor to death in the trenches was [[artillery]] fire from the opposing side.

Generally, senior commands disapproved of any slackening of the offensive for humanitarian reasons and so ordered their troops not to permit enemy stretcher-bearers to operate in no man's land. However, this order was almost invariably ignored by the soldiers in the trenches, who knew that it was to the mutual benefit of the fighting men of both sides to allow the wounded to be retrieved. So, as soon as hostilities ceased, parties of stretcher bearers, marked with [[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross]] flags, would go out to recover the wounded, sometimes swapping enemy wounded for their own.\n\nOne famous truce was the [[Christmas truce]] between British and German soldiers in the winter of 1914, on the front near [[Armenti\u00e8res]]. German soldiers began singing [[Christmas carol]]s and soon soldiers left their trenches. The soldiers exchanged gifts and stories, and played several games of football.<ref name=\"Victory For Human Kindness\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25206-2004Dec24.html \"Remembering a Victory For Human Kindness \u2013 WWI's Puzzling, Poignant Christmas Truce\"], Brown, David, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 25 December 2004.</ref> The commanders of the warring nations disapproved of this [[cease fire]], and the British [[court martial]]ed several of their soldiers. \n\nIn the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were recorded without any success.<ref>Weintraub (2001), p. 198</ref> In some French sectors, singing and an exchange of thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, although these may simply have reflected a seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.<ref>Cazals (2005), p. 125</ref>\n\n==Weapons of World War I trench warfare==\n\n===Infantry weapons===\n{{Main article|List of infantry weapons of World War I}}\n[[File:N\u00b023 MkII-Version Fusil.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|British [[Mills bomb]] N\u00b023 Mk II, with rod for launch by rifle]]\n[[File:Wwitrenchweapons.JPG|thumb|Various trench weapons used by British and Canadian soldiers in WWI on display at the [[Canadian War Museum]]]]\n[[File:Sauterelle 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|French soldiers with a [[Sauterelle]] bomb-throwing [[crossbow]], c. 1915]]\nAt the start of the First World War, the standard [[infantry]] soldier's primary weapons were the [[rifle]] and [[bayonet]]; other weapons got less attention. Especially for the British, what [[hand grenade]]s were issued tended to be few in numbers and less effective. This emphasis began to shift as soon as trench warfare began; militaries rushed improved grenades into mass production, including [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\nThe hand grenade came to be one of the primary infantry weapons of trench warfare. Both sides were quick to raise specialist grenadier groups. The grenade enabled a soldier to engage the enemy without exposing himself to fire, and it did not require precise accuracy to kill or maim. Another benefit was that if a soldier could get close enough to the trenches, enemies hiding in trenches could be attacked. The Germans and Turks were well equipped with grenades from the start of the war, but the British, who had ceased using grenadiers in the 1870s and did not anticipate a siege war, entered the conflict with virtually none, so soldiers had to improvise bombs with whatever was available (see [[Jam Tin Grenade]]). By late 1915, the British [[Mills bomb]] had entered wide circulation, and by the end of the war 75 million had been used.\n\nSince the troops were often not adequately equipped for trench warfare, improvised weapons were common in the first encounters, such as [[Trench raiding club|short wooden clubs and metal maces]], as well as [[trench knives]] and [[brass knuckles]]. According to the semi-biographical war novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', many soldiers preferred to use a sharpened [[Entrenching tool|spade]] as an improvised melee weapon instead of the bayonet, as the bayonet tended to get \"stuck\" in stabbed opponents, rendering it useless in heated battle. The shorter length also made them easier to use in the confined quarters of the trenches. These tools could then be used to dig in after they had taken a trench. As the war progressed, better equipment was issued, and improvised arms were discarded.\n\nA specialised group of fighters called ''trench sweepers'' (''Nettoyeurs de Tranch\u00e9es'' or ''Zigouilleurs'') evolved to fight within the trenches. They cleared surviving enemy personnel from recently overrun trenches and made clandestine raids into enemy trenches to gather intelligence. Volunteers for this dangerous work were often exempted from participation in frontal assaults over open ground and from routine work like filling sandbags, draining trenches, and repairing barbed wire in no-man's land. When allowed to choose their own weapons, many selected grenades, knives and pistols. [[FN M1900]] pistols were highly regarded for this work, but never available in adequate quantities. [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]], [[Savage Model 1907]], [[Star Bonifacio Echeverria]] and [[Ruby pistol]]s were widely used.<ref>Vanderlinden, Anthony ''[[American Rifleman]]'' (October 2008) pp. 91\u2013120</ref>\n\nVarious mechanical devices were invented for throwing hand grenades into enemy trenches.

The technology was in its infancy, and use was not very common until the end of 1917 when portability and reliability were improved. It was used in more than 300 documented battles. By 1918, it became a weapon of choice for ''Sto\u00dftruppen'' ([[Stormtrooper]]s) with a team of six ''Pioniere'' ([[combat engineer]]s) per squad.\n\nUsed by American soldiers in the Western front, the [[pump action shotgun]] was a formidable weapon in short range combat, enough so that Germany lodged a formal protest against their use on 14 September 1918, stating \"every prisoner found to have in his possession such guns or ammunition belonging thereto forfeits his life\", though this threat was apparently never carried out. The U.S. military began to issue models specially modified for combat, called \"trench guns\", with shorter barrels, higher capacity magazines, no [[Choke (firearms)|choke]], and often heat shields around the barrel, as well as lugs for the [[M1917 bayonet]]. [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]] and some British soldiers were also known to use [[sawn-off shotgun]]s in trench raids, because of their portability, effectiveness at close range, and ease of use in the confines of a trench. This practice was not officially sanctioned, and the shotguns used were invariably modified sporting guns.\n\n===Wire===\n[[File:The people's war book; history, cyclopaedia and chronology of the great world war (1919) (14781623592).jpg|thumb|French soldiers struggle to pass multiple lines of barbed wire]]\nThe use of lines of [[barbed wire]], razor wire, and other [[wire obstacle]]s is effective in stalling infantry traveling across the battlefield. Although the barbs or razors might cause minor injuries, the purpose was to entangle the limbs of enemy soldiers, forcing them to stop and methodically pull or work the wire off, likely taking several seconds, or even longer. This is deadly when the wire is emplaced at points of maximum exposure to concentrated enemy firepower, in plain sight of enemy fire bays and machine guns. The combination of wire and firepower was the cause of most failed attacks in trench warfare and their very high casualties. [[Liddell Hart]] identified barbed wire and the machine gun as the elements that had to be broken to regain a mobile battlefield.\n\nA basic wire line could be created by draping several strands of barbed wire between wooden posts driven into the ground. Loose lines of wire can be more effective in entangling than tight ones, and it was common to use the coils of barbed wire as delivered only partially stretched out, called [[concertina wire]]. Placing and repairing wire in [[no man's land]] relied on stealth, usually done at night by special [[Wiring party|wiring parties]], who could also be tasked with secretly sabotaging enemy wires. The [[screw picket]], invented by the [[Germans]] and later adopted by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] during the war, was quieter than driving stakes. Wire often stretched the entire length of a battlefield's trench line, in multiple lines, sometimes covering a depth {{convert|30|m|ft|-1}} or more.\n\nMethods to defeat it are rudimentary. Prolonged artillery bombardment could damage them, but not reliably. The first soldier meeting the wire could jump onto the top of it, hopefully depressing it enough for those that followed to get over him; this still took at least one soldier out of action for each line of wire. In World War I, British and Commonwealth forces relied on [[wire cutter]]s, which proved unable to cope with the heavier gauge German wire.<ref name=\"Canada's Army, p.79\"/> The [[Bangalore torpedo]] was adopted by many armies, and continued in use past the end of World War II.<ref>\"Bangalore torpedo\", in Fitzsimons, Bernard, editor, ''Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' (London: Phoebus Publishing Company 1977), Volume 3, p. 269.</ref>\n\n===Machine guns===\n{{Main article|Machine gun}}\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Vickers machine gun]]]]\nThe Germans embraced the machine gun from the outset\u2014in 1904, sixteen units were equipped with the 'Maschinengewehr'&mdash;and the machine gun crews were the elite infantry units; these units were attached to Jaeger (light infantry) battalions.

Minutes before the attack on Vimy Ridge the Canadians thickened the artillery [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]] by aiming machine guns indirectly to deliver [[plunging fire]] on the Germans. They also significantly increased the number of machine guns per battalion. To match demand, production of the Vickers machine gun was contracted to firms in the United States. By 1917, every company in the British forces were also equipped with four [[Lewis gun|Lewis light machine gun]]s, which significantly enhanced their [[firepower]].\n\nThe [[heavy machine gun]] was a specialist weapon, and in a static trench system was employed in a scientific manner, with carefully calculated fields of fire, so that at a moment's notice an accurate burst could be fired at the enemy's parapet or a break in the wire. Equally it could be used as light artillery in bombarding distant trenches. Heavy machine guns required teams of up to eight men to move them, maintain them, and keep them supplied with ammunition. This made them impractical for offensive manoeuvres, contributing to the stalemate on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nOne [[machine gun nest]] was theoretically able to mow down hundreds of enemies charging in the open through [[no man's land]].\nHowever, while WWI machine guns were able to shoot hundreds of rounds per minute in theory, they were still prone to overheating and jamming, which often necessitated firing in short bursts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/machineguns.htm|title=First World War.com - Weapons of War: Machine Guns|website=Firstworldwar.com|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> However, their potential was increased significantly when emplaced behind multiple lines of barbed wire to slow any advancing enemy.\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:15in howitzer Menin Rd 5 October 1917.jpg|thumb|Loading a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} howitzer]]\n[[Artillery]] dominated the battlefields of trench warfare. An infantry attack was rarely successful if it advanced beyond the range of its supporting artillery. In addition to bombarding the enemy infantry in the trenches, the artillery could be used to precede infantry advances with a creeping [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]], or engage in [[counter-battery]] duels to try to destroy the enemy's guns. Artillery mainly fired [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[high-explosive]], [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] or, later in the war, gas shells. The British experimented with firing [[thermite]] [[incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] shells, to set trees and ruins alight. However, all armies experienced shell shortages during the first year or two of World War I, due to underestimating their usage in intensive combat. This knowledge had been gained by the combatant nations in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], when daily artillery fire consumed ten times more than daily factory output, but had not been applied.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|pp=229\u201330}}\n\nArtillery pieces were of two types: [[infantry support gun]]s and [[howitzer]]s. Guns fired high-velocity shells over a flat trajectory and were often used to deliver fragmentation and to cut barbed wire. Howitzers lofted the shell over a high trajectory so it plunged into the ground. The largest calibers were usually howitzers. The German {{convert|420|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} howitzer weighed 20 tons and could fire a one-ton shell over {{convert|10|km|smi|abbr=on}}. A critical feature of period artillery pieces was the [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]], which meant the gun did not need to be re-aimed after each shot, permitting a tremendous increase in rate of fire.\n\nInitially each gun would need to register its aim on a known target, in view of an observer, in order to fire with precision during a battle. The process of gun registration would often alert the enemy an attack was being planned. Towards the end of 1917, artillery techniques were developed enabling fire to be delivered accurately without registration on the battlefield\u2014the gun registration was done behind the lines then the pre-registered guns were brought up to the front for a surprise attack.\n\n===Mortars===\n[[File:French86mmCompressedAirTrenchMortarNYT17Feb1918.jpg|thumb|French soldiers operating a compressed-air trench mortar of 86-millimetre calibre]]\n[[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]]s, which lobbed a shell in a high arc over a relatively short distance, were widely used in trench fighting for harassing the forward trenches, for cutting wire in preparation for a raid or attack, and for destroying dugouts, saps and other entrenchments. In 1914, the British fired a total of 545 mortar shells; in 1916, they fired over 6,500,000. Similarly, howitzers, which fire on a more direct arc than mortars, raised in number from over 1,000 shells in 1914, to over 4,500,000 in 1916. The smaller numerical difference in mortar rounds, as opposed to howitzer rounds, is presumed by many to be related to the expanded costs of manufacturing the larger and more resource intensive howitzer rounds.\n\nThe main British mortar was the [[Stokes Mortar|Stokes]], a precursor of the modern mortar. It was a light mortar, simple in operation, and capable of a rapid rate of fire by virtue of the propellant cartridge being attached to the base shell. To fire the Stokes mortar, the round was simply dropped into the tube, where the percussion cartridge was detonated when it struck the firing pin at the bottom of the barrel, thus being launched. The Germans used a range of mortars. The smallest were grenade-throwers ('[[Granatenwerfer]]') which fired the stick grenades which were commonly used. Their medium trench-mortars were called mine-throwers ('[[Minenwerfer]]'). The [[heavy mortar]] was called the 'Ladungswerfer', which threw \"aerial torpedoes\", containing a {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} charge to a range of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The flight of the missile was so slow and leisurely that men on the receiving end could make some attempt to seek shelter.\n\nMortars had certain advantages over artillery such as being much more portable and the ability to fire without leaving the relative safety of trenches. Moreover, Mortar were able to fire directly into the trenches, which was hard to do with artillery.<ref>General Sir Martin Farndale, [http://www.naval-military-press.com/FMPro?-db=nmp%5fproducts.fp5&-format=nmpweb%2fdetail.htm&-lay=cgi&-sortfield=date&Co=NMP&search=History%20of%20the%20Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Artillery.%20Western%20Front%201914-18&-max=20&-recid=35933&-token.0=3668698&-find= History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery.

Soldiers went into battle wearing simple cloth or leather caps that offered virtually no protection from the damage caused by modern weapons. German troops were wearing the traditional leather ''[[Pickelhaube]]'' (spiked helmet), with a covering of cloth to protect the leather from the splattering of mud.\n\nOnce the war entered the static phase of trench warfare, the number of lethal head wounds that troops were receiving from [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] increased dramatically. The French were the first to see a need for greater protection and began to introduce steel helmets in the summer of 1915. The [[Adrian helmet]] replaced the traditional French [[kepi]] and was later adopted by the Belgian, Italian and many other armies.\n\nAt about the same time the British were developing their own helmets. The French design was rejected as not strong enough and too difficult to mass-produce. The design that was eventually approved by the British was the [[Brodie helmet]]. This had a wide brim to protect the wearer from falling objects, but offered less protection to the wearer's neck. When the Americans entered the war, this was the helmet they chose, though some units used the French Adrian helmet.\n\nThe traditional German 'pickelhaube' was replaced by the ''[[Stahlhelm]]'' or \"steel helmet\" in 1916. Some elite Italian units used a helmet derived from ancient Roman designs. None of these standard helmets could protect the face or eyes, however. Special face-covers were designed to be used by machine gunners, and the Belgians tried out goggles made of louvres to protect the eyes. Additionally, tank crews were issued with or fashioned makeshift face masks to protect against the hot metal fragments that ricocheted around the compartment when the exterior of the tank was hit with machinegun fire.\n\n===Mines===\n[[tunnel warfare|Mines]] - tunnels under enemy lines packed with explosives and detonated - were widely used in WWI to destroy or disrupt enemy's trench lines. Mining and counter-mining became a major part of trench warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zggykqt|title=Was the tunnellers' secret war the most barbaric of WW1?|website=BBC Guides|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/mine_warfare|title=Mine Warfare - International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|website=Encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Gas===\n{{Main article|Chemical weapons in World War I}}\n[[File:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Australia]]n infantry wearing [[gas mask]]s, [[Ypres]], September 1917]]\nWorld War I saw large-scale use of poison gasses. At the start of the war, the gas agents used were relatively weak and delivery unreliable, but by mid-war advances in this [[chemical warfare]] reached horrifying levels.\n\nThe first methods of employing gas was by releasing it from a cylinder when the wind was favourable. This was prone to miscarry if the direction of the wind was misjudged. Also, the cylinders needed to be positioned in the front trenches where they were likely to be ruptured by enemy bombardment. Later, gas was delivered directly to enemy trenches by artillery or mortar shell, reducing friendly casualties significantly. Lingering agents could still affect friendly troops that advanced to enemy trenches following its use.\n\nEarly on, soldiers made improvised [[gas mask]]s by urinating on a handkerchief and putting it over their nose and mouth so the [[urea]] would disable the poison. Armies rushed to issue regulation gas masks as regular equipment for front line troops. Anti-gas equipment and procedures improved significantly during the war, to the point that gas attacks had become less devastating at the war's end.\n\nSeveral different gas agents were used. [[Tear gas]] was first employed in August 1914 by the French, but this could only temporarily disable the enemy. In April 1915, [[chlorine]] gas was first used by Germany at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Exposure to a large dose could kill, and those not killed could suffer permanent lung damage. But the gas was easy to detect by scent and sight. [[Phosgene]], first used in December 1915, was the most lethal killing gas of World War I; it was 18 times more powerful than chlorine and much more difficult to detect.\n\nHowever, the most effective gas was [[mustard gas]], introduced by Germany in July 1917. Mustard gas was not as fatal as phosgene, but it was hard to detect and lingered on the surface of the battlefield, so could inflict casualties over a long period. Even if not inhaled, it could slowly [[Blister agent|burn the skin]], but quickly burned via the eyes or any wounds, causing blindness and intense suffering. Mustard gas also had the property of being heavier than air, causing it to sink down hills and therefore down into trenches. Casualties from mustard gas were unlikely to be fit to fight again, yet only 2% of mustard gas casualties died. The added burden of long-term care of casualties from mustard gas actually increased its overall effectiveness compared to more immediately lethal gas agents.\n\n===Aircraft===\nThe fundamental purpose of the aircraft in trench warfare was [[reconnaissance]] and [[artillery]] observation. [[Aerial reconnaissance]] was so significant in exposing movements, it has been said the trench stalemate was a product of it.<ref>\"Aces: A Story of the First World War\", written by George Pearson, historical advisors Brereton Greenhous & Philip Markham, [[National Film Board of Canada]], 1993.</ref> The role of the [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] was to protect friendly [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and destroy those of the enemy, or at least deny them the freedom of friendly airspace. This involved achieving [[air superiority]] over the battlefield by destroying the enemy's fighters as well.\n\nSpotter aircraft would monitor the fall of shells during registration of the artillery. Reconnaissance aircraft would map trench lines, first with hand-drawn diagrams, later with [[photography]], monitor enemy troop movements, and locate enemy [[artillery batteries]] so that they could be destroyed with [[counter-battery]] fire.\n\n===New weapons===\n[[File:France1918.jpg|thumb|upright|German soldier with [[MP 18]], 1918]]\nIn 1917 and 1918, new types of weapons were fielded. They changed the face of warfare tactics and were later employed during World War II.\n\nThe French introduced the [[Chauchat|CSRG 1915 Chauchat]] during Spring 1916 around the concept of \"[[walking fire]]\", employed in 1918 when 250,000 weapons were fielded.<!--did this contribute to the adoption of the BAR?--> More than 80,000 of the best shooters received the semi-automatic [[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917|RSC 1917]] rifle, allowing them to rapid fire at waves of attacking soldiers. Firing ports were installed in the newly arrived [[Renault FT]] tanks.\n\nThe French Army fielded a ground version of the [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss Canon de 37&nbsp;mm]] used by the French Navy. It was primarily used to destroy German machine gun nests and concrete reinforced pillboxes with high explosive and armour-piercing rounds. \n\nA new type of machine gun was introduced in 1916. Initially an aircraft weapon, the [[Bergmann MG15 nA Gun|Bergmann LMG 15]] was modified for ground use,{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} with the later dedicated ground version being the LMG 15 n. A. It was used as an infantry weapon on all European and Middle Eastern fronts until the end of World War I. It later inspired the [[MG 30]] and the [[MG 34]] as well as the concept of the [[general-purpose machine gun]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nWhat became known as the [[submachine gun]] had its genesis in World War I, developed around the concepts of infiltration and fire and movement, specifically to clear trenches of enemy soldiers when engagements were unlikely to occur beyond a range of a few feet. The [[MP 18]] was the first practical submachine gun used in combat. It was fielded in 1918 by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] as the primary weapon of the [[stormtrooper]]s, assault groups that specialised in trench combat.\n\n==Mining==\n{{main article|Mining (military)}}\n[[File:Mine-explosion-1916.jpg|thumb|Explosion of a mine seen from a French position. 1916]]\n[[File:Battle of the Somme 1916 - Y Sap mine, La Boisselle.jpg|thumb|{{center|Plan of the ''Y Sap'' mine}}]]\nThe dry chalk of the [[River Somme|Somme]] was especially suited to mining, but with the aid of pumps, it was also possible to mine in the sodden clay of [[Flanders]]. Specialist tunneling companies, usually made up of men who had been [[miners]] in civilian life, would dig tunnels under no man's land and beneath the enemy's trenches.<ref>Finlayson, Damien (2010): ''Crumps and Camouflets: Australian Tunnelling Companies on the Western Front.''

The crater served two purposes: it could destroy or breach the enemy's trench and, by virtue of the raised lip that they produced, could provide a ready-made \"trench\" closer to the enemy's line. When a mine was detonated, both sides would race to occupy and fortify the crater.\n\nIf the miners detected an enemy tunnel in progress, they would often [[counter-mine]] and try to drive a tunnel under the enemy's tunnel in which they would detonate explosives to create a [[camouflet]] to destroy the enemy's tunnel. Night raids were also conducted with the sole purpose of destroying the enemy's mine workings. On occasion, mines would cross and fighting would occur underground. The mining skills could also be used to move troops unseen. On one occasion a whole British division was moved through interconnected workings and sewers without German observation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The British detonated [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|19 mines of varying sizes]] on July 1, 1916, the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]. The largest mines\u2014the Y Sap Mine and the [[Lochnagar Mine]]\u2014each containing 24 tons of explosives, were blown near [[La Boiselle]], throwing earth 4,000 feet into the air.{{citation needed|reason=4,000' sounds dubious|date=July 2018}}\n\nAt 3.10 <small>AM</small> on June 7, 1917, a [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|series of mines]] was detonated by the British to launch the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. The average mine contained 21 tons of explosive and the largest, 125 feet beneath [[Sint-Elooi|Saint-Eloi]], was twice the average at 42 tons. As remarked by General Plumer to his staff the evening before the attack:\n\n:\"Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography.\"<ref name=ww1dotcom>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/messines.htm |title=Battles: The Battle of Messines, 1917|website=Firstworldwar.com |accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe craters from these and many other mines on the Western Front are still visible today. Two undetonated mines remained in the ground near Messines, with their location mislaid after the war. One blew during a thunderstorm in 1955; the other remains in the ground.<ref name=ww1dotcom /> Significant [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mining operations]] were also carried out on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]].\n\n==Trench battles==\n[[File:Vimy Memorial - German trenches, mortar emplacement.jpg|thumb|German trenches in [[Vimy]]]]\nWhile trenches have often been dug as defensive measures, in the pre-[[firearm]] era, they were mainly a type of hindrance for an attacker of a fortified location, such as the [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] (or [[moat]]) around a [[castle]]. An early example of this can be seen in the [[Battle of the Trench]].\n\nOnly with the advent of accurate firearms did the use of trenches as positions for the defender of a fortification become common. Elaborate trench and bunker systems were employed by the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to withstand British artillery barrages and bayonet charges during the [[New Zealand Wars]] in the 1840s. Trench systems were also employed in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]<ref name=\"Keegan, p. 179\"/> and American Civil War. The military usage evolved very quickly in the First World War, until whole systems of extensive main trenches, backup trenches (in case the first lines were overrun) and communication trenches had been developed, often stretching dozens of kilometres along a front without interruption, and some kilometres further back from the opponent's lines.\n\n===Strategy===\nThe fundamental strategy of trench warfare in World War I was to defend one's own position strongly while trying to achieve a breakthrough into the enemy's rear. The effect was to end up in [[battle of attrition|attrition]]; the process of progressively grinding down the opposition's resources until, ultimately, they are no longer able to wage war. This did not prevent the ambitious commander from pursuing the strategy of annihilation\u2014the ideal of an offensive battle which produces victory in one decisive engagement.\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the British forces during most of World War I, General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], was constantly seeking a \"breakthrough\" which could then be exploited with cavalry divisions. His major trench offensives\u2014the Somme in 1916 and Flanders in 1917\u2014were conceived as breakthrough battles but both degenerated into costly attrition. The Germans actively pursued a strategy of attrition in the [[Battle of Verdun]], the sole purpose of which was to \"bleed the French Army white\". At the same time the Allies needed to mount offensives in order to draw attention away from other hard-pressed areas of the line.{{sfn|Foley|2007|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\n===World War I tactics===\n[[File:Periscope tranch\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise.jpg|thumb|upright|French troopers using a [[periscope]], 1915]]\nThe popular image of a trench assault is of a wave of soldiers, bayonets fixed, going \"over the top\" and marching in a line across no man's land into a hail of enemy fire. This was the standard method early in the war; it was rarely successful.  More common was an attack at night from an advanced post in no man's land, having cut the barbed wire beforehand. In 1915, the Germans innovated with [[infiltration tactics]] where small groups of highly trained and well-equipped troops would attack vulnerable points and bypass strong points, driving deep into the rear areas. The distance they could advance was still limited by their ability to supply and communicate.\n\nThe role of artillery in an infantry attack was twofold. The first aim of a bombardment was to prepare the ground for an infantry assault, killing or demoralising the enemy garrison and destroying their defences. The duration of these initial bombardments varied, from seconds to days. Artillery bombardments prior to infantry assaults were often ineffective at destroying enemy defences, only serving to provide advance notice of an attack. The British bombardment that began the [[Battle of the Somme]] lasted eight days but did little damage to either the German barbed wire or their deep dug-outs, where defenders were able to wait out the bombardment in relative safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/entertainment/14625124.The_Somme_from_the_German_side_of_the_wire/ |title=The Somme from the German side of the wire (From The Northern Echo) |newspaper=Thenorthernecho.co.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= 1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOnce the guns stopped, the defenders had time to emerge and were usually ready for the attacking infantry. The second aim was to protect the attacking infantry by providing an impenetrable \"[[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]\" or curtain of shells to prevent an enemy counter-attack. The first attempt at sophistication was the \"lifting barrage\" where the first objective of an attack was intensely bombarded for a period before the entire barrage \"lifted\" to fall on a second objective farther back. However, this usually expected too much of the infantry, and the usual outcome was that the barrage would outpace the attackers, leaving them without protection.\n\nThis resulted in the use of the \"creeping barrage\" which would lift more frequently but in smaller steps, sweeping the ground ahead and moving so slowly that the attackers could usually follow closely behind it. This became the standard method of attack from late 1916 onward. The main benefit of the barrage was suppression of the enemy rather than to cause casualties or material damage.\n\nCapturing the objective was half the battle, but the battle was only won if the objective was held. The attacking force would have to advance with not only the weapons required to capture a trench but also the tools\u2014sandbags, picks and shovels, barbed wire\u2014to fortify and defend from counter-attack. A successful advance would take the attackers beyond the range of their own field artillery, making them vulnerable, and it took time to move guns up over broken ground. The Germans placed great emphasis on immediately counter-attacking to regain lost ground. This strategy cost them dearly in 1917 when the British started to limit their advances so as to be able to meet the anticipated counter-attack from a position of strength. Part of the British artillery was positioned close behind the original start line and took no part in the initial bombardment, so as to be ready to support later phases of the operation while other guns were moved up.\n\n===World War I communications===\n[[File:British signallers at Sedd-el-Bahr.jpg|thumb|British and French soldiers lay a [[telegraph]] cable in [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], 1915]]\nBecause the battlefield of trench warfare was very deep and hazardous, communications were a major difficulty. Wireless communications were still in their infancy in World War I, so the available methods were [[telephone]], [[telegraph]], [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], [[signal lamp]]s, [[signal flare]]s, [[homing pigeon]]s, and [[Runner (soldier)|message runners]]. Though telephone was the most effective method, with telegraph a close second, their cables were vulnerable to artillery fire and were often broken early in the battle. To help compensate for this, the cables could be laid in a ladder-like pattern so that multiple redundant lines were available.\n\nFrequently, message delays caused them to be out-of-date by the time they were received. Communication with higher [[division (military)|division]], [[corps]] and [[Field army|army]] [[Headquarters#Military|HQs]] incurred even longer delays, which were doubled if a reply was needed. Some messages were misdirected or lost completely. If a message sent out did not get a reply or confirmation back, the sender could not tell if the original message did not get through, or if it did but the reply did not get back, resulting in confusion worse than if no communication had been attempted.\n\nIt was not uncommon for a commanding officer to wait hours for messages over the course of a battle, making any changes of plans almost impossible. The outcome of many battles was left in the hands of the [[Company (military unit)|company]] and [[platoon]] commanders in the middle of the action, who often had less experience, had very limited additional resources or information, and very limited authority to deviate from the original orders given before the start of the battle. Unable to react to any changing battle situation, many opportunities were lost, and many hopeless attacks persisted.\n\nOnly starting in 1916, on the battlefield of Verdun, came the use of portable small radio stations that could transmit short [[Morse code]]s. [[Radio frequency]] overlap occurred with neighboring divisions until precise regulation and radio discipline developed. Also, enemy interception was common until effective [[codebook]] practices were enforced. These problems were not completely resolved until the war's end.\n\n==World War I \u2013 breaking the stalemate==\n\nThroughout World War I, the major combatants slowly developed different ways of breaking the stalemate of trench warfare; the Germans focused more on new tactics while the British and French focused on [[tank]]s.\n\n===Infiltration tactics===\n{{Main article|Infiltration tactics}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-132-26A, Sto\u00dftrupp.jpg|thumb|German ''[[stormtrooper|Sto\u00dftruppen]]'' (stormtroopers) rising from trenches to attack]]\nAs far back as the 18th century, [[Prussian Army|Prussian military]] doctrine stressed maneuver and force concentration to achieve a decisive battle ({{lang|de|Vernichtungsschlacht}}). The German military searched for ways to apply this in the face of trench warfare. Experiments with new tactics by [[Willy Rohr]], a Prussian captain serving in the [[Vosges mountains]] in 1915, got the attention of the Minister of War. These tactics carried Prussian military doctrine down to smallest units \u2014 specially trained troops maneuvered and massed to assault positions they chose on their own.<ref>Hermann Cron: ''Geschichte des Deutschen Heeres im Welkriege 1914-1918''; Berlin 1937, p. 23</ref> During the next 2 years the German army tried to establish special [[stormtrooper]] detachments in all its units by sending selected men to Rohr and have those men then train their comrades in their original units.\n\nSimilar tactics were developed independently in other countries, such as French Army captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Laffargue|fr}} in 1915, and Russian general [[Aleksei Brusilov]] in 1916, but these failed to be adopted as any military doctrine.<ref>[http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/csir_13/csir_13.asp CSI Report No. 13: Tactical responses to concentrated artillery: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602111844/http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/csir_13/csir_13.asp |date=2011-06-02 }} (Combat Studies Institute, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth).</ref>\n\nThe German stormtrooper methods involved men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down covering fire for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, intended to achieve surprise by disrupting entrenched enemy positions, aimed to bypass strongpoints and to attack the weakest parts of an enemy's line. Additionally, they acknowledged the futility of managing a grand detailed plan of operations from afar, opting instead for junior officers on the spot to exercise initiative.<ref>Hellmuth Gruss: ''Die deutschen Sturmbataillone im Weltkrieg. Aufbau und Verwendung.; Berlin, 1939</ref>\n\nThe Germans employed and improved infiltration tactics in a series of smaller to larger battles, each increasingly successful, leading up to the [[Battle of Caporetto]] against the Italians in 1917, and finally the massive German [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 against the British and French. German infiltration tactics are sometimes called \"Hutier tactics\" by others, after [[Oskar von Hutier]], the general leading the German [[18th Army (German Empire)|18th Army]], which had the farthest advance in that offensive. After a stunningly rapid advance, the offensive failed to achieve a [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]]; German forces stalled after outrunning their supply, artillery, and reinforcements, which could not catch up over the shell-torn ground left ruined by Allied attacks in the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916. The exhausted German forces were soon pushed back in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, and the Germans were unable to organise another major offensive before the war's end. In post-war years, other nations did not fully appreciate these German tactical innovations amidst the overall German defeat.\n\n===Tanks===\n{{Main article|Tanks in World War I}}\n[[File:British Mark IV Tadpole tank.jpg|thumb|This British [[Mark IV tank]] displays a \"tadpole tail\" extension for crossing especially wide trenches]]\nTanks were first introduced by the British as a means to attack enemy trenches, by combining heavy firepower ([[machine gun]]s or [[tank gun|light artillery guns]]), protection from [[small-arms]] fire ([[vehicle armour|armour]]), and battlefield mobility ([[Continuous track|tracks]]). [[British heavy tanks of World War I|These tanks]] were designed with [[rhomboid]]-shaped tracks to easily crush barbed wire lines and cross trenches. They were first deployed in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme in limited numbers, proving unreliable and ineffective at first, as mechanical and logistical issues overshadowed implementing a coherent tank doctrine, with the additional challenge of traversing ground torn apart by years of shell fire. At the [[First Battle of Cambrai]] in 1917, improved tanks in larger numbers demonstrated the potential of tank warfare, though German improvised [[Anti-tank warfare#Anti-tank tactics|anti-tank tactics]], including using direct fire from field artillery, also proved effective.\n[[File:Failed trench crossing.jpg|thumb|Failure of a tank to cross an [[Anti-tank trench|anti-tank trench]]]]\nBy 1918, tank capabilities and tactics improved, their numbers increased and, combined with [[French tanks of World War I|French tanks]], finally helped break the stalemate. During the last 100 days of the war, Allied forces harried the Germans back using infantry supported by tanks and by close air support. By the war's end, tanks become a significant element of warfare; the proposed British [[Plan 1919]] would have employed tanks as a primary factor in military strategy. However, the impact of tanks in World War I was less than it could have been, due to their late introduction and the inherent issues that plague implementing revolutionary technology.\n\nBetween the two world wars many nations developed their own [[Tanks of the interwar period|unique tanks]] and divergent theories of tank tactics, including the UK, France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Japan, the US, and Italy. Though German tank development was restricted by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|treaty ending World War I]], Germany successfully combined their own tanks (plus [[Tanks of Czechoslovakia|Czech tanks]] from [[occupied Czechoslovakia]]) with infiltration tactics to produce [[blitzkrieg]] during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perrett|first1=Bryan|title=A History of Blitzkrieg|date=1983|publisher=Jove Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-515-10234-5|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n===[[European Theatre]]===\n[[File:Hochwald historic photo.jpg|A retractable [[Gun turret|turret]] of [[Ouvrage Hochwald]], one of the largest fortifications of the [[Maginot Line]], 1940|thumb]]\nIn the decade [[Causes of World War II|leading up to World War II]], the French built the [[Maginot Line]], based on their experience with trench warfare in World War I. The Maginot Line was an extensive [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] defensive system far superior to any previous trench system: a chain of massive constructions of concrete, iron, and steel fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, linked by [[tunnel network]]s.  It covered the length of the Franco-German border and was {{convert|20-25|km}} wide. It was supported by numerous underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, with its own telephone network and [[narrow gauge]] railways with [[Armoured train|armoured locomotives]], backed up with heavy [[Railway gun|rail artillery]]. French military experts placed high value on the Line, saying it would curb German aggression, as any invasion force would be halted long enough for French forces to mobilize and counterattack through Belgium. It was only partially successful; in the [[Battle of France]], the main German \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" attack struck through the weakly held [[Ardennes forest]], the gap between the end of the Maginot Line and the advancing Anglo-French mobile forces heading into Belgium. Small secondary German attacks concentrated at a few points in the Line had moderate success. The bulk of the Maginot Line was untouched, and survives today.\n\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1940 E932.jpg|thumb| A British trench mortar post in North Africa, 1940]]\nThe return of [[Maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]] in World War II reduced the emphasis of trench warfare, as defenders commonly lack the time to build up such battlefield defenses before they are forced to redeploy, due to the more rapidly-changing strategic situation. But trench systems can still be effective locally, wherever mobility was limited, the front lines are static, or around known critical objectives that cannot be bypassed. More quickly improvised [[defensive fighting position]]s, using \"scrapes\" or \"foxholes\", possibly supplemented by [[sand bag]]s, local materials, debris, or rubble, remain in common use. These will typically be improved and expanded by the defenders, eventually becoming full trench systems, if given enough time and resources.\n[[File:Soldati brasiliani a Montese.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] in a trench in [[Montese]] during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of World War II, 1944]]\n\nAt the [[Battle of Sevastopol]], [[Red Army]] forces successfully held trench systems on the narrow peninsula for several months against intense German bombardment. The Western Allies in 1944 broke through the incomplete [[Atlantic Wall]] with relative ease through a combination of amphibious landings, naval gunfire, air attack, and [[airborne troops|airborne]] landings. Combined arms tactics where infantry, artillery, armour and aircraft cooperate closely greatly reduced the importance of trench warfare. It was, however, still a valuable method for reinforcing natural boundaries and creating a line of defence. For example, at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], soldiers on both sides dug trenches within the ruins.

Entrenchment allowed the Germans, who were massively outnumbered, to survive a bombardment from the largest concentration of artillery in history; as the Red Army attempted to cross the marshy riverside terrain, they lost tens of thousands of casualties to the entrenched Germans before breaking through.\n\n===Pacific War===\nDuring the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese used a labyrinth of underground fixed positions to slow down the Allied advances on many Pacific Islands. The Japanese built fixed fortifications on [[Iwo Jima]], [[Okinawa]], and [[Guadalcanal]] using a [[tunnel network|system of tunnels]] to interconnect their fortified positions. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout the defenses, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking interior lines. This network of [[bunker]]s, tunnels, and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, the Japanese had on [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] several levels of honeycombed fortifications. The Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water and ammo for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Tomb Called Iwo Jima|last=King|first=Dan|publisher=Pacific Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1500343385|location=|pages=58\u201359|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Japanese caused the American advance to slow down and caused massive casualties with these underground fixed positions.

When two large armoured armies meet, the result has generally been mobile warfare of the type which developed in World War II. However, trench warfare reemerged in the latter stages of the [[Chinese Civil War]] ([[Huaihai Campaign]]), the [[Korean War]] (from July 1951 to its end), and at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]] and other later locations and engagements during the [[Vietnam War]]. During the Cold War, [[NATO]] forces routinely trained to fight through extensive works called \"Soviet-style trench systems\", named after the [[Warsaw Pact]]'s complex systems of field fortifications, an extension of Soviet field entrenching practices for which they were famous in their [[Great Patriotic War]] (the Eastern Front of World War II).\n[[File:Ukranian army trench in Donbass.jpg|thumb| Ukrainian soldier in the trenches during the [[War in Donbass]]]]\nAnother example of trench warfare after World Wars I and II was the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], in which both armies lacked training in [[combined arms]] operations. However, both  countries often prepared entrenched defensive positions and [[Tunnel warfare|tunnel]]s to protect and supply the cities and bases throughout the regions. Another problem and success from both sides was their military mobility had reduced, drastically, due to hidden various [[Anti-tank mine|land mines]], and with no firm or stable ground footing it was easy to slide down or even get buried in a camouflaged [[Anti-tank|anti-tank trench]]. Tactics used included trench warfare, machine gun posts, bayonet charges, booby traps, use of barbed wire across trenches and on [[no-man's land]], Iranian [[human wave attack]]s, and Iraq's extensive use of chemical weapons such as [[mustard gas]] against Iranian troops. <ref name=\"Benschopvan der Schans1997\">{{cite journal|last1=Benschop|first1=H.

Attacks across open ground became even more dangerous after the introduction of rapid-firing [[artillery]], exemplified by the [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897|\"French 75\"]], and [[high explosive]] [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] rounds. The increases in firepower had outstripped the ability of [[infantry]] (or even  [[cavalry]]) to cover the ground between firing lines, and the ability of armour to withstand fire. It would take a revolution in mobility to change that.<ref >Dyer, Gwynn. ''War''; Dupuy, Trevor N. ''Evolution of Weapons and Warfare''</ref>\n\nTrench warfare became archetypically associated with the [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), when the [[Race to the Sea]] rapidly expanded trench use on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] starting in September 1914.<ref name=\"Ellis, p 10\">{{harvnb|Ellis|1977|p=10}}.</ref> By the end of October 1914, the whole front in Belgium and France had solidified into lines of trenches, which lasted until the last weeks of the war.  Mass infantry assaults were futile in the face of artillery fire, as well as rapid rifle and machine-gun fire. Both sides concentrated on breaking up enemy attacks and on protecting their own troops by digging deep into the ground.{{sfn|Ellis|1977|p=4}} Trench warfare also took place on other [[Front (military)|front]]s, including in [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italy]] and at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].\n\n[[File:Boer Trench.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Boer]] trench at the [[Battle of Magersfontein]] contributed to the surprise defeat of the Highland Brigade on 11 December 1899 during the [[Second Boer War]]]]\n\n===Symbol for the futility of war===\nTrench warfare has become a powerful symbol of the futility of war.<ref name=g4>{{harvnb|Griffith|1996|p=4}}.</ref> Its image is of young men going \"over the top\" (over the parapet of the trench, to attack the enemy trench line) into a maelstrom of fire leading to near-certain death, typified by the [[First day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme]] (on which the British Army suffered nearly 60,000 casualties) or the grinding slaughter in the mud of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]].{{sfn|Edmonds|1991|p=24}} To the French, the equivalent is the attrition of the [[Battle of Verdun]] in which the [[French Army]] suffered 380,000 casualties.<ref>Lavalle, John in ''World War I \u2013 a student encyclopaedia'', ABC-Clio, 2006, p. 1886</ref>\n\nTrench warfare is associated with mass slaughter in appalling conditions. Many critics have argued that brave men went to their deaths because of incompetent and narrow-minded commanders who failed to adapt to the new conditions of trench warfare: class-ridden and backward-looking generals put their faith in the attack, believing superior morale and dash would overcome the weapons and moral inferiority of the defender.{{sfn|Ellis|1977|pp=80\u201387}} British public opinion often repeated the theme that their soldiers were  \"[[lions led by donkeys]]\".{{sfn|Griffith|1996|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nWorld War I generals are often portrayed as callously persisting in repeated hopeless attacks against trenches. There were failures such as Passchendaele, and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] has often been criticised for allowing his battles to continue long after they had lost any purpose other than attrition.{{sfn|Griffith|1996|p= 10}} Haig's defenders counter that the attrition was necessary in order to cause attrition in the German army.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carter Malkasian|title=A History of Modern Wars of Attrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xxu2iEEKi-IC&pg=PA40|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood|page=40|isbn=9780275973797}}</ref>\n\nThe problems of trench warfare were recognised, and attempts were made to address them. These included improvements in artillery, infantry tactics, and the development of [[Tanks in World War I|tanks]]. By 1918, taking advantage of failing German morale, Allied attacks were generally more successful and suffered fewer casualties; in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], there was even a return to mobile warfare.\n\n==World War I: Entrenchment==\nTrench warfare in 1914-17 provided a very high degree of defence. According to two historians:\n:Trenches were longer, deeper, and better defended by steel, concrete, and barbed wire than ever before. They were far stronger and more effective than chains of forts, for they formed a continuous network, sometimes with four or five parallel lines linked by interfacings. They were dug far below the surface of the earth out of reach of the heaviest artillery....Grand battles with the old maneuvers were out of the question. Only by bombardment, sapping, and assault could the enemy be shaken, and such operations had to be conducted on an immense scale to produce appreciable results. Indeed, it is questionable whether the German lines in France could ever have been broken if the Germans had not wasted their resources in unsuccessful assaults, and the blockade by sea had not gradually cut off their supplies. In such warfare no single general could strike a blow that would make him immortal; the \"glory of fighting\" sank down into the dirt and mire of trenches and dugouts.<ref>[[James Harvey Robinson]] and [[Charles A.

Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]]]]\nAlthough technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not fully absorbed the implications. The French and German armies adopted different [[Military tactics|tactical doctrines]]: the French relied on the attack with speed and surprise, and the Germans relied on [[firepower]], investing heavily in [[howitzer]]s and [[machine gun]]s. The British lacked an official tactical doctrine, with an officer corps that rejected theory in favour of pragmatism.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|pp=14\u201319}}\n\nWhile the armies expected to use entrenchments and cover, they did not allow for the effect of [[Defence in depth|defences in depth]]. They required a deliberate approach to seizing positions from which fire support could be given for the next phase of the attack, rather than a rapid move to break the enemy's line.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|p=27}} It was assumed that artillery could still destroy entrenched troops, or at least suppress them sufficiently for friendly infantry and cavalry to manoeuvre.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|pp=24\u201325}}\n\n[[File:French trench battle.jpg|thumb|French Trench in northeastern France]]\nDigging-in when defending a position was a standard practice by the start of WWI. To [[frontal assault|attack frontally]] was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy. After the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]] in September 1914, an extended series of attempted flanking moves, and matching extensions to the fortified defensive lines, developed into the \"[[Race to the Sea|race to the sea]]\", by the end of which German and Allied armies had produced a matched pair of trench lines from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] border in the south to the [[North Sea]] coast of Belgium.\n\nArmies were also limited by logistics. The heavy use of artillery meant that ammunition expenditure was far higher in WWI than in any previous conflict. Horses and carts were insufficient for transporting large quantities over long distances, so armies had trouble moving far from railheads. This greatly slowed advances, making it impossible for either side to achieve a breakthrough that would change the war. This situation would only be altered in WWII with greater use of motorized vehicles.<ref>Van Creveld, p. 109-41</ref>\n\nTrench warfare prevailed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] from late 1914 until the Germans launched their [[Operation Michael|Spring Offensive]] on 21 March 1918. After the buildup of forces in 1915, the Western Front became a stalemated struggle between equals, to be decided by attrition. Frontal assaults, and their associated casualties, became inevitable because the continuous trench lines had no open flanks. Casualties of the defenders matched those of the attackers, as vast reserves were expended in costly counter-attacks or exposed to the attacker's massed artillery. There were periods in which rigid trench warfare broke down, such as during the [[Battle of the Somme]], but the lines never moved very far. The war would be won by the side that was able to commit the last reserves to the Western Front.{{sfn|Bidwell|Graham|2004|pp=\u201325}}\n[[File:French army.jpg|thumb|left|Hot Shower-Bath establishment installed by an ingenious French engineer, November, 1914]]\nEarly World War I trenches were simple. They lacked [[Traverse (trench warfare)|traverses]], and according to pre-war doctrine were to be packed with men fighting shoulder to shoulder. This doctrine led to heavy casualties from artillery fire. This vulnerability, and the length of the front to be defended, soon led to front line trenches being held by fewer men. The defenders augmented the trenches themselves with barbed wire strung in front to impede movement; wiring parties went out every night to repair and improve these forward defences.{{sfn|Griffith|2004|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe small, improvised trenches of the first few months grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. They resisted both artillery bombardment and mass infantry assault. Shell-proof dugouts became a high priority.{{sfn|Griffith|2004|p=11}} The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as \"no man's land\" and varied in width depending on the battlefield. On the Western Front it was typically between {{convert|100|and|300|yd|m|order=flip|round=5}}, though only {{convert|30|yd|m|order=flip|round=5}} on [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]].\n\nAfter the German withdrawal to the [[Hindenburg line]] in March 1917, no man's land stretched to over a kilometre in places. At the \"[[Quinn's Post]]\" in the cramped confines of the Anzac battlefield at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], the opposing trenches were only {{convert|16|yd|m|order=flip}} apart and the soldiers in the trenches constantly threw [[hand grenade]]s at each other. On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and in the Middle East, the areas to be covered were so vast, and the distances from the factories supplying shells, bullets, concrete and barbed wire so great, trench warfare in the West European style often did not occur.\n\nIn the [[Alps]], trench warfare even stretched onto vertical slopes and deep into the mountains, to heights of {{convert|3900|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[Ortler]] had an artillery position on its summit near the front line. The trench-line management and trench profiles had to be adapted to the rough terrain, hard rock, and harsh weather conditions. Many trench systems were constructed within glaciers such as the [[Adamello-Presanella]] group or the famous city below the ice on the [[Marmolada]] in the [[Dolomites]].\n\n===Trench defensive systems===\nVery early in the war, British defensive doctrine suggested a main trench system of three parallel lines, interconnected by communications trenches. The point at which a communications trench intersected the front trench was of critical importance, and it was usually heavily fortified. The front trench was lightly garrisoned and typically only occupied in force during \"stand to\" at dawn and dusk. Between {{convert|70|and|100|yd|m|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} behind the front trench was located the support (or \"travel\") trench, to which the garrison would retreat when the front trench was bombarded.\n\nBetween {{convert|100|and|300|yd|m|order=flip|-1}} further to the rear was located the third reserve trench, where the reserve troops could amass for a counter-attack if the front trenches were captured. This defensive layout was soon rendered obsolete as the power of artillery grew; however, in certain sectors of the front, the support trench was maintained as a decoy to attract the enemy bombardment away from the front and reserve lines. Fires were lit in the support line to make it appear inhabited and any damage done immediately repaired.\n\n[[File:Aerial view Loos-Hulluch trench system July 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Aerial view of opposing trench lines between Loos and Hulluch, July 1917. German trenches at the right and bottom, British at the top-left.]]\nTemporary trenches were also built. When a major attack was planned, assembly trenches would be dug near the front trench. These were used to provide a sheltered place for the waves of attacking troops who would follow the first waves leaving from the front trench. \"Saps\" were temporary, unmanned, often dead-end utility trenches dug out into no-man's land. They fulfilled a variety of purposes, such as connecting the front trench to a listening post close to the enemy wire or providing an advance \"jumping-off\" line for a surprise attack. When one side's front line bulged towards the opposition, a [[Salient (military)|salient]] was formed. The concave trench line facing the salient was called a \"re-entrant.\" Large salients were perilous for their occupants because they could be assailed from three sides.\n\nBehind the front system of trenches there were usually at least two more partially prepared trench systems, kilometres to the rear, ready to be occupied in the event of a retreat. The Germans often prepared multiple redundant trench systems; in 1916 their [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] front featured two complete trench systems, one kilometre apart, with a third partially completed system a further kilometre behind. This duplication made a decisive breakthrough virtually impossible. In the event that a section of the first trench system was captured, a \"switch\" trench would be dug to connect the second trench system to the still-held section of the first.\n\nThe Germans, who had based their knowledge on studies of the [[Russo-Japanese War]],<ref name=\"Keegan, p. 179\">{{harvnb|Keegan|1999|p=179}}.</ref> made something of a science out of designing and constructing defensive works. They used reinforced concrete to construct deep, shell-proof, ventilated dugouts, as well as strategic strongpoints. They were more willing than their opponents to make a strategic withdrawal to a superior prepared defensive position. They were also the first to apply the concept of \"defence in depth\", where the front-line zone was hundreds of metres deep and contained a series of [[redoubt]]s rather than a continuous trench. Each redoubt could provide supporting fire to its neighbours, and while the attackers had freedom of movement between the redoubts, they would be subjected to withering [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire.\n\nThe British eventually adopted a similar approach, but it was incompletely implemented when the Germans launched the 1918 Spring Offensive and proved disastrously ineffective. France, by contrast, relied on artillery and reserves, not entrenchment. The characteristic barbed wire placed before trenches, in belts {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep or more, differed, too; the German wire was heavier gauge, and British wire cutters, designed for the thinner native product, were unable to cut it.<ref name=\"Canada's Army, p.79\">''Canada's Army'', p. 79.</ref>\n\nThe static movement of trench warfare and a need for protection from [[sniper]]s created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name=\"One\">[https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/ Trench Loopholes, Le Linge]</ref>  Often a steel plate was used with a \"key hole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n===Trench construction===\n[[File:Trench construction diagram 1914.png|thumb|Trench construction diagram from a 1914 British infantry manual]]\n[[File:Trench warfare.png|thumb|Soldiers training in trench warfare, with well-defined fire bays connected by offset traverse trenches, with zigzag communication trenches leading to the rear area]]\n\nA well-developed trench had to be at least {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} deep to allow men to walk upright and still be protected. Trenches were never straight but were dug in a [[zigzag]]ging or stepped pattern, with all straight sections generally kept less than a dozen meters (yards). Later, this evolved to have the combat trenches broken into distinct [[wikt:fire bay|fire bay]]s connected by traverses. While this isolated the view of friendly soldiers along their own trench, this ensured the entire trench could not be [[Enfilade and defilade|enfiladed]] if the enemy gained access at any one point; or if a bomb, grenade, or shell landed in the trench, the blast could not travel far.\n\nThe banked earth on the lip of the trench facing the enemy was called the [[parapet]] and had a fire step. The embanked rear lip of the trench was called the parados. The parados protected the soldier's back from shells falling behind the trench. The sides of the trench were often revetted with [[sandbag]]s, [[wire mesh]], wooden frames and sometimes roofs. The floor of the trench was usually covered by wooden [[duckboards]]. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath.\n\n[[Dugout (military)|Dugouts]] of varying degrees of comfort would be built in the rear of the support trench. British dugouts were usually {{convert|2.5|to|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} deep, whereas German dugouts were typically much deeper, usually a minimum of {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} deep and sometimes dug three stories down, with concrete staircases to reach the upper levels.\n\n[[File:Periscope rifle Gallipoli 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Australian light horse]]man using a [[periscope rifle]], Gallipoli 1915]]\nTo allow a soldier to see out of the trench without exposing his head, a loophole could be built into the parapet. A loophole might simply be a gap in the sandbags, or it might be fitted with a steel plate. German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the [[Periscope|trench periscope]] \u2013 in its simplest form, just a stick with two angled pieces of mirror at the top and bottom. A number of armies made use of the [[periscope rifle]], which enabled soldiers to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet, although at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy. The device is most associated with Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, where the [[Turkey|Turks]] held the high ground.\n\nThere were three standard ways to dig a trench: entrenching, sapping, and tunnelling. Entrenching, where a man would stand on the surface and dig downwards, was most efficient, as it allowed a large digging party to dig the full length of the trench simultaneously. However, entrenching left the diggers exposed above ground and hence could only be carried out when free of observation, such as in a rear area or at night. [[Sapping]] involved extending the trench by digging away at the end face. The diggers were not exposed, but only one or two men could work on the trench at a time.\n\nTunnelling was like sapping except that a \"roof\" of soil was left in place while the trench line was established and then removed when the trench was ready to be occupied. The guidelines for British trench construction stated that it would take 450 men 6 hours at night to complete {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} of front-line trench system. Thereafter, the trench would require constant maintenance to prevent deterioration caused by weather or shelling.\n\n[[File:Breastwork trench at Armentieres 1916.jpg|thumb|Breastwork \"trench\", Armenti\u00e8res, 1916]]\nThe battlefield of [[Flanders]] presented numerous problems for the practice of trench warfare, especially for the Allied forces, mainly British and Canadians, who were often compelled to occupy the low ground. Heavy shelling quickly destroyed the network of ditches and water channels which had previously drained this low-lying area of Belgium. In most places, the [[water table]] was only a metre or so below the surface, meaning that any trench dug in the ground would quickly flood.\n\nConsequently, many \"trenches\" in Flanders were actually above ground and constructed from massive breastworks of sandbags filled with clay. Initially, both the parapet and parados of the trench were built in this way, but a later technique was to dispense with the parados for much of the trench line, thus exposing the rear of the trench to fire from the reserve line in case the front was breached.\n\n===Trench geography in World War I===\nThe confined, static, and subterranean nature of trench warfare resulted in it developing its own peculiar form of [[geography]]. In the forward zone, the conventional transport infrastructure of roads and rail were replaced by the network of trenches and [[trench railways]]. The critical advantage that could be gained by holding the high ground meant that minor hills and ridges gained enormous significance. Many slight hills and valleys were so subtle as to have been nameless until the front line encroached upon them. Some hills were named for their height in metres, such as [[Battle of Hill 60 (Western Front)|Hill 60]]. A farmhouse, windmill, quarry, or copse of trees would become the focus of a determined struggle simply because it was the largest identifiable feature. However, it would not take the artillery long to obliterate it, so that thereafter it became just a name on a map.\n\nBattlefield features could be given a descriptive name (\"[[Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke|Polygon Wood]]\" near [[Ypres]] or \"[[Battle of Lone Pine|Lone Pine]]\"), a whimsical name (\"[[Sausage Valley]]\" and \"Mash Valley\" on the Somme), a unit name (\"Inniskilling Inch\" at Helles named for the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]) or the name of a soldier (\"Monash Valley\" at [[Anzac Cove|Anzac]] named after General [[John Monash]]). Prefixing a feature with \"Dead Man's\" was also popular for obvious reasons, such as \"Dead Man's Road\" leading in to Pozi\u00e8res, or \"Dead Man's Ridge\" at Anzac.\n\nThere were numerous trench networks named \"The Chessboard\" or \"The Gridiron\" because of the pattern they described. For the Australians at [[Battle of Mouquet Farm|Mouquet Farm]], the advances were so short and the terrain so featureless that they were reduced to naming their objectives as \"points\" on the map, such as \"Point 81\" and \"Point 55.\"\n\nEnemy trenches, which would become objectives in an attack, needed to be named as well. Many were named for some observed event such as \"German Officers' Trench\" at Anzac or \"Ration Trench\" on the Somme. The British gave an alcoholic flavour to the German trenches in front of Ginchy: \"Beer Trench\", \"Bitter Trench\", \"Hop Trench\", \"Ale Alley\", and \"Pilsen Trench.\" Other objectives were named according to their role in the trench system, such as the \"Switch Trench\" and \"Intermediate Trench\" on the Somme.\n\nSome sections of the British trench system read like a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board, with names such as \"Park Lane\" and \"Bond Street\". British regular divisions habitually named their trenches after units, which resulted in names such as \"Munster Alley\" ([[Royal Munster Fusiliers]]), \"Black Watch Alley\" ([[Black Watch|Black Watch Regiment]]) and \"Border Barricade\" ([[Border Regiment]]). The [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]]s tended to name features after soldiers (\"Plugge's Plateau\", \"Walker's Ridge\", \"Quinn's Post\", \"Johnston's Jolly\", \"Russell's Top\", \"Brind's Road\" and so forth).\n\n==World War I: Life in the trenches==\n[[File:Distribution de pinard.jpg|thumb|upright|Distribution of ''pinard'' (ration wine) in a French trench in winter, considered important for morale]]\n[[File:Studying French.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Studying French in the Trenches\", ''The Literary Digest'', October 20, 1917]]\n[[File:Barbier fran\u00e7ais tranch\u00e9es.jpg|thumb|A barber in a French trench]]\nAn individual unit's time in a front-line trench was usually brief; from as little as one day to as much as two weeks at a time before being relieved. The 31st Australian Battalion once spent 53 days in the line at [[Villers-Bretonneux]], but such a duration was a rare exception. The [[10th Battalion, CEF]], averaged front line tours of six days in 1915 and 1916.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calgaryhighlanders.com/history/10th/history/1915.htm|title=1915 history|website=Calgaryhighlanders.com|accessdate=12 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708112043/http://calgaryhighlanders.com/history/10th/history/1915.htm|archive-date=2011-07-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe units who manned the front line trenches the longest were the [[Portuguese Expeditionary Corps]] from [[Portugal]] stationed in Northern France; unlike the other allies the Portuguese couldn't rotate units from the front lines due to lack of reinforcements sent from Portugal, nor could they replace the depleted units that lost manpower due to the war of attrition. With this rate of casualties and no reinforcements forthcoming most of the men were denied leave and had to serve long periods in the trenches with some units spending up to six consecutive months in the front line with little to no leave during that time.<ref> Rodrigues, Hugo.

The frequency of combat would increase for the units of the \"elite\" fighting divisions\u2014on the Allied side; the British regular divisions, the [[Canadian Corps]], the French XX Corps, and the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]]s.\n\nSome sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, making life in the trenches comparatively easy. When the [[I Anzac Corps]] first arrived in France in April 1916 after the evacuation of Gallipoli, they were sent to a relatively peaceful sector south of [[Armenti\u00e8res]] to \"acclimatise\". In contrast, some other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. On the Western Front, [[Ypres]] was invariably hellish, especially for the British in the exposed, overlooked salient. However, even quiet sectors amassed daily casualties through [[sniper]] fire, artillery,<!--can subsume \"mortar\" under arty, in context--> disease, and [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]]. In the first six months of 1916, before the launch of the [[Somme Offensive]], the British did not engage in any significant battles on their sector of the Western Front and yet suffered 107,776 casualties. Only 1 in 2 men would return alive and unwounded from the trenches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=YouTube is nothing like a RS}}\n\nA sector of the front would be allocated to an army [[corps]], usually comprising three [[division (military)|division]]s. Two divisions would occupy adjacent sections of the front, and the third would be in rest to the rear. This breakdown of duty would continue down through the army structure, so that within each front-line division, typically comprising three [[infantry]] [[brigade]]s (regiments for the Germans), two brigades would occupy the front and the third would be in reserve. Within each front-line brigade, typically comprising four [[battalion]]s, two battalions would occupy the front with two in reserve, and so on for companies and platoons. The lower down the structure this division of duty proceeded, the more frequently the units would rotate from front-line duty to support or reserve.\n\nDuring the day, snipers and [[artillery observer]]s in balloons made movement perilous, so the trenches were mostly quiet. It was during these daytime hours that the soldiers would amuse themselves with [[Trench Magazine|trench magazines]]. Because of the peril associated with daytime activities, trenches were busiest at night when the cover of darkness allowed movement of troops and supplies, the maintenance and expansion of the barbed wire and trench system, and reconnaissance of the enemy's defenses. Sentries in listening posts out in no man's land would try to detect enemy patrols and working parties, or indications that an attack was being prepared.\n\nPioneered by the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] in February 1915,<ref name=\"CanadasArmyp82\">''Canada's Army'', p. 82.</ref> [[Trench raiding|trench raid]]s were carried out in order to capture prisoners and \"booty\"&mdash;letters and other documents to provide intelligence about the unit occupying the opposing trenches. As the war progressed, raiding became part of the general British policy, the intention being to maintain the fighting spirit of the troops and to deny no man's land to the Germans. As well, they were intended to compel the enemy to reinforce, which exposed their troops to artillery fire.<ref name=\"CanadasArmyp82\"/>\n\nSuch dominance was achieved at a high cost when the enemy replied with their own artillery,<ref name=\"CanadasArmyp82\"/> and a post-war British analysis concluded the benefits were probably not worth the cost. Early in the war, surprise raids would be mounted, particularly by the Canadians, but increased vigilance made achieving surprise difficult as the war progressed. By 1916, raids were carefully planned exercises in combined arms and involved close co-operation between infantry and artillery.\n\nA raid would begin with an intense artillery bombardment designed to drive off or kill the front-trench garrison and cut the barbed wire. Then the bombardment would shift to form a \"box barrage\", or cordon, around a section of the front line to prevent a counter-attack intercepting the raid. However, the bombardment also had the effect of notifying the enemy of the location of the planned attack, thus allowing reinforcements to be called in from wider sectors.\n\n==World War I: Death and disease in the trenches==\n[[File:Captured World War I German machine gun position, Grevillers, France (21610477616).jpg|thumb|A German machine gun position just after its capture by New Zealand soldiers, with a dead German among the debris, [[Grevillers]], 24 August 1918, Hundred Days Offensive]]\n[[File:Stretcher bearers Passchendaele August 1917.jpg|thumb|Stretcher bearers, [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], August 1917]]\n[[File:NLS Haig - Smashed up German trench on Messines Ridge with dead.jpg|thumb|Dead German soldiers lie in the rubble of a trench destroyed by [[#Mining|mine explosion]], [[Messines Ridge]], 1917]]\n\nApproximately 10-15 percent of all fighting soldiers died during the First World War.<ref name=\":3\" /> The main contributor to death in the trenches was [[artillery]] fire from the opposing side.

Generally, senior commands disapproved of any slackening of the offensive for humanitarian reasons and so ordered their troops not to permit enemy stretcher-bearers to operate in no man's land. However, this order was almost invariably ignored by the soldiers in the trenches, who knew that it was to the mutual benefit of the fighting men of both sides to allow the wounded to be retrieved. So, as soon as hostilities ceased, parties of stretcher bearers, marked with [[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross]] flags, would go out to recover the wounded, sometimes swapping enemy wounded for their own.\n\nOne famous truce was the [[Christmas truce]] between British and German soldiers in the winter of 1914, on the front near [[Armenti\u00e8res]]. German soldiers began singing [[Christmas carol]]s and soon soldiers left their trenches. The soldiers exchanged gifts and stories, and played several games of football.<ref name=\"Victory For Human Kindness\">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25206-2004Dec24.html \"Remembering a Victory For Human Kindness \u2013 WWI's Puzzling, Poignant Christmas Truce\"], Brown, David, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 25 December 2004.</ref> The commanders of the warring nations disapproved of this [[cease fire]], and the British [[court martial]]ed several of their soldiers. \n\nIn the Decembers of 1916 and 1917, German overtures to the British for truces were recorded without any success.<ref>Weintraub (2001), p. 198</ref> In some French sectors, singing and an exchange of thrown gifts was occasionally recorded, although these may simply have reflected a seasonal extension of the live-and-let-live approach common in the trenches.<ref>Cazals (2005), p. 125</ref>\n\n==Weapons of World War I trench warfare==\n\n===Infantry weapons===\n{{Main article|List of infantry weapons of World War I}}\n[[File:N\u00b023 MkII-Version Fusil.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|British [[Mills bomb]] N\u00b023 Mk II, with rod for launch by rifle]]\n[[File:Wwitrenchweapons.JPG|thumb|Various trench weapons used by British and Canadian soldiers in WWI on display at the [[Canadian War Museum]]]]\n[[File:Sauterelle 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|French soldiers with a [[Sauterelle]] bomb-throwing [[crossbow]], c. 1915]]\nAt the start of the First World War, the standard [[infantry]] soldier's primary weapons were the [[rifle]] and [[bayonet]]; other weapons got less attention. Especially for the British, what [[hand grenade]]s were issued tended to be few in numbers and less effective. This emphasis began to shift as soon as trench warfare began; militaries rushed improved grenades into mass production, including [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\nThe hand grenade came to be one of the primary infantry weapons of trench warfare. Both sides were quick to raise specialist grenadier groups. The grenade enabled a soldier to engage the enemy without exposing himself to fire, and it did not require precise accuracy to kill or maim. Another benefit was that if a soldier could get close enough to the trenches, enemies hiding in trenches could be attacked. The Germans and Turks were well equipped with grenades from the start of the war, but the British, who had ceased using grenadiers in the 1870s and did not anticipate a siege war, entered the conflict with virtually none, so soldiers had to improvise bombs with whatever was available (see [[Jam Tin Grenade]]). By late 1915, the British [[Mills bomb]] had entered wide circulation, and by the end of the war 75 million had been used.\n\nSince the troops were often not adequately equipped for trench warfare, improvised weapons were common in the first encounters, such as [[Trench raiding club|short wooden clubs and metal maces]], as well as [[trench knives]] and [[brass knuckles]]. According to the semi-biographical war novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', many soldiers preferred to use a sharpened [[Entrenching tool|spade]] as an improvised melee weapon instead of the bayonet, as the bayonet tended to get \"stuck\" in stabbed opponents, rendering it useless in heated battle. The shorter length also made them easier to use in the confined quarters of the trenches. These tools could then be used to dig in after they had taken a trench. As the war progressed, better equipment was issued, and improvised arms were discarded.\n\nA specialised group of fighters called ''trench sweepers'' (''Nettoyeurs de Tranch\u00e9es'' or ''Zigouilleurs'') evolved to fight within the trenches. They cleared surviving enemy personnel from recently overrun trenches and made clandestine raids into enemy trenches to gather intelligence. Volunteers for this dangerous work were often exempted from participation in frontal assaults over open ground and from routine work like filling sandbags, draining trenches, and repairing barbed wire in no-man's land. When allowed to choose their own weapons, many selected grenades, knives and pistols. [[FN M1900]] pistols were highly regarded for this work, but never available in adequate quantities. [[Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless]], [[Savage Model 1907]], [[Star Bonifacio Echeverria]] and [[Ruby pistol]]s were widely used.<ref>Vanderlinden, Anthony ''[[American Rifleman]]'' (October 2008) pp. 91\u2013120</ref>\n\nVarious mechanical devices were invented for throwing hand grenades into enemy trenches.

The technology was in its infancy, and use was not very common until the end of 1917 when portability and reliability were improved. It was used in more than 300 documented battles. By 1918, it became a weapon of choice for ''Sto\u00dftruppen'' ([[Stormtrooper]]s) with a team of six ''Pioniere'' ([[combat engineer]]s) per squad.\n\nUsed by American soldiers in the Western front, the [[pump action shotgun]] was a formidable weapon in short range combat, enough so that Germany lodged a formal protest against their use on 14 September 1918, stating \"every prisoner found to have in his possession such guns or ammunition belonging thereto forfeits his life\", though this threat was apparently never carried out. The U.S. military began to issue models specially modified for combat, called \"trench guns\", with shorter barrels, higher capacity magazines, no [[Choke (firearms)|choke]], and often heat shields around the barrel, as well as lugs for the [[M1917 bayonet]]. [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]] and some British soldiers were also known to use [[sawn-off shotgun]]s in trench raids, because of their portability, effectiveness at close range, and ease of use in the confines of a trench. This practice was not officially sanctioned, and the shotguns used were invariably modified sporting guns.\n\n===Wire===\n[[File:The people's war book; history, cyclopaedia and chronology of the great world war (1919) (14781623592).jpg|thumb|French soldiers struggle to pass multiple lines of barbed wire]]\nThe use of lines of [[barbed wire]], razor wire, and other [[wire obstacle]]s is effective in stalling infantry traveling across the battlefield. Although the barbs or razors might cause minor injuries, the purpose was to entangle the limbs of enemy soldiers, forcing them to stop and methodically pull or work the wire off, likely taking several seconds, or even longer. This is deadly when the wire is emplaced at points of maximum exposure to concentrated enemy firepower, in plain sight of enemy fire bays and machine guns. The combination of wire and firepower was the cause of most failed attacks in trench warfare and their very high casualties. [[Liddell Hart]] identified barbed wire and the machine gun as the elements that had to be broken to regain a mobile battlefield.\n\nA basic wire line could be created by draping several strands of barbed wire between wooden posts driven into the ground. Loose lines of wire can be more effective in entangling than tight ones, and it was common to use the coils of barbed wire as delivered only partially stretched out, called [[concertina wire]]. Placing and repairing wire in [[no man's land]] relied on stealth, usually done at night by special [[Wiring party|wiring parties]], who could also be tasked with secretly sabotaging enemy wires. The [[screw picket]], invented by the [[Germans]] and later adopted by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] during the war, was quieter than driving stakes. Wire often stretched the entire length of a battlefield's trench line, in multiple lines, sometimes covering a depth {{convert|30|m|ft|-1}} or more.\n\nMethods to defeat it are rudimentary. Prolonged artillery bombardment could damage them, but not reliably. The first soldier meeting the wire could jump onto the top of it, hopefully depressing it enough for those that followed to get over him; this still took at least one soldier out of action for each line of wire. In World War I, British and Commonwealth forces relied on [[wire cutter]]s, which proved unable to cope with the heavier gauge German wire.<ref name=\"Canada's Army, p.79\"/> The [[Bangalore torpedo]] was adopted by many armies, and continued in use past the end of World War II.<ref>\"Bangalore torpedo\", in Fitzsimons, Bernard, editor, ''Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' (London: Phoebus Publishing Company 1977), Volume 3, p. 269.</ref>\n\n===Machine guns===\n{{Main article|Machine gun}}\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Vickers machine gun]]]]\nThe Germans embraced the machine gun from the outset\u2014in 1904, sixteen units were equipped with the 'Maschinengewehr'&mdash;and the machine gun crews were the elite infantry units; these units were attached to Jaeger (light infantry) battalions.

Minutes before the attack on Vimy Ridge the Canadians thickened the artillery [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]] by aiming machine guns indirectly to deliver [[plunging fire]] on the Germans. They also significantly increased the number of machine guns per battalion. To match demand, production of the Vickers machine gun was contracted to firms in the United States. By 1917, every company in the British forces were also equipped with four [[Lewis gun|Lewis light machine gun]]s, which significantly enhanced their [[firepower]].\n\nThe [[heavy machine gun]] was a specialist weapon, and in a static trench system was employed in a scientific manner, with carefully calculated fields of fire, so that at a moment's notice an accurate burst could be fired at the enemy's parapet or a break in the wire. Equally it could be used as light artillery in bombarding distant trenches. Heavy machine guns required teams of up to eight men to move them, maintain them, and keep them supplied with ammunition. This made them impractical for offensive manoeuvres, contributing to the stalemate on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].\n\nOne [[machine gun nest]] was theoretically able to mow down hundreds of enemies charging in the open through [[no man's land]].\nHowever, while WWI machine guns were able to shoot hundreds of rounds per minute in theory, they were still prone to overheating and jamming, which often necessitated firing in short bursts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/machineguns.htm|title=First World War.com - Weapons of War: Machine Guns|website=Firstworldwar.com|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref> However, their potential was increased significantly when emplaced behind multiple lines of barbed wire to slow any advancing enemy.\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:15in howitzer Menin Rd 5 October 1917.jpg|thumb|Loading a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} howitzer]]\n[[Artillery]] dominated the battlefields of trench warfare. An infantry attack was rarely successful if it advanced beyond the range of its supporting artillery. In addition to bombarding the enemy infantry in the trenches, the artillery could be used to precede infantry advances with a creeping [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]], or engage in [[counter-battery]] duels to try to destroy the enemy's guns. Artillery mainly fired [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]], [[high-explosive]], [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] or, later in the war, gas shells. The British experimented with firing [[thermite]] [[incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] shells, to set trees and ruins alight. However, all armies experienced shell shortages during the first year or two of World War I, due to underestimating their usage in intensive combat. This knowledge had been gained by the combatant nations in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], when daily artillery fire consumed ten times more than daily factory output, but had not been applied.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|pp=229\u201330}}\n\nArtillery pieces were of two types: [[infantry support gun]]s and [[howitzer]]s. Guns fired high-velocity shells over a flat trajectory and were often used to deliver fragmentation and to cut barbed wire. Howitzers lofted the shell over a high trajectory so it plunged into the ground. The largest calibers were usually howitzers. The German {{convert|420|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} howitzer weighed 20 tons and could fire a one-ton shell over {{convert|10|km|smi|abbr=on}}. A critical feature of period artillery pieces was the [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]], which meant the gun did not need to be re-aimed after each shot, permitting a tremendous increase in rate of fire.\n\nInitially each gun would need to register its aim on a known target, in view of an observer, in order to fire with precision during a battle. The process of gun registration would often alert the enemy an attack was being planned. Towards the end of 1917, artillery techniques were developed enabling fire to be delivered accurately without registration on the battlefield\u2014the gun registration was done behind the lines then the pre-registered guns were brought up to the front for a surprise attack.\n\n===Mortars===\n[[File:French86mmCompressedAirTrenchMortarNYT17Feb1918.jpg|thumb|French soldiers operating a compressed-air trench mortar of 86-millimetre calibre]]\n[[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]]s, which lobbed a shell in a high arc over a relatively short distance, were widely used in trench fighting for harassing the forward trenches, for cutting wire in preparation for a raid or attack, and for destroying dugouts, saps and other entrenchments. In 1914, the British fired a total of 545 mortar shells; in 1916, they fired over 6,500,000. Similarly, howitzers, which fire on a more direct arc than mortars, raised in number from over 1,000 shells in 1914, to over 4,500,000 in 1916. The smaller numerical difference in mortar rounds, as opposed to howitzer rounds, is presumed by many to be related to the expanded costs of manufacturing the larger and more resource intensive howitzer rounds.\n\nThe main British mortar was the [[Stokes Mortar|Stokes]], a precursor of the modern mortar. It was a light mortar, simple in operation, and capable of a rapid rate of fire by virtue of the propellant cartridge being attached to the base shell. To fire the Stokes mortar, the round was simply dropped into the tube, where the percussion cartridge was detonated when it struck the firing pin at the bottom of the barrel, thus being launched. The Germans used a range of mortars. The smallest were grenade-throwers ('[[Granatenwerfer]]') which fired the stick grenades which were commonly used. Their medium trench-mortars were called mine-throwers ('[[Minenwerfer]]'). The [[heavy mortar]] was called the 'Ladungswerfer', which threw \"aerial torpedoes\", containing a {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} charge to a range of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The flight of the missile was so slow and leisurely that men on the receiving end could make some attempt to seek shelter.\n\nMortars had certain advantages over artillery such as being much more portable and the ability to fire without leaving the relative safety of trenches. Moreover, Mortar were able to fire directly into the trenches, which was hard to do with artillery.<ref>General Sir Martin Farndale, [http://www.naval-military-press.com/FMPro?-db=nmp%5fproducts.fp5&-format=nmpweb%2fdetail.htm&-lay=cgi&-sortfield=date&Co=NMP&search=History%20of%20the%20Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Artillery.%20Western%20Front%201914-18&-max=20&-recid=35933&-token.0=3668698&-find= History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery.

Soldiers went into battle wearing simple cloth or leather caps that offered virtually no protection from the damage caused by modern weapons. German troops were wearing the traditional leather ''[[Pickelhaube]]'' (spiked helmet), with a covering of cloth to protect the leather from the splattering of mud.\n\nOnce the war entered the static phase of trench warfare, the number of lethal head wounds that troops were receiving from [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] increased dramatically. The French were the first to see a need for greater protection and began to introduce steel helmets in the summer of 1915. The [[Adrian helmet]] replaced the traditional French [[kepi]] and was later adopted by the Belgian, Italian and many other armies.\n\nAt about the same time the British were developing their own helmets. The French design was rejected as not strong enough and too difficult to mass-produce. The design that was eventually approved by the British was the [[Brodie helmet]]. This had a wide brim to protect the wearer from falling objects, but offered less protection to the wearer's neck. When the Americans entered the war, this was the helmet they chose, though some units used the French Adrian helmet.\n\nThe traditional German 'pickelhaube' was replaced by the ''[[Stahlhelm]]'' or \"steel helmet\" in 1916. Some elite Italian units used a helmet derived from ancient Roman designs. None of these standard helmets could protect the face or eyes, however. Special face-covers were designed to be used by machine gunners, and the Belgians tried out goggles made of louvres to protect the eyes. Additionally, tank crews were issued with or fashioned makeshift face masks to protect against the hot metal fragments that ricocheted around the compartment when the exterior of the tank was hit with machinegun fire.\n\n===Mines===\n[[tunnel warfare|Mines]] - tunnels under enemy lines packed with explosives and detonated - were widely used in WWI to destroy or disrupt enemy's trench lines. Mining and counter-mining became a major part of trench warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zggykqt|title=Was the tunnellers' secret war the most barbaric of WW1?|website=BBC Guides|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/mine_warfare|title=Mine Warfare - International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|website=Encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Gas===\n{{Main article|Chemical weapons in World War I}}\n[[File:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Australia]]n infantry wearing [[gas mask]]s, [[Ypres]], September 1917]]\nWorld War I saw large-scale use of poison gasses. At the start of the war, the gas agents used were relatively weak and delivery unreliable, but by mid-war advances in this [[chemical warfare]] reached horrifying levels.\n\nThe first methods of employing gas was by releasing it from a cylinder when the wind was favourable. This was prone to miscarry if the direction of the wind was misjudged. Also, the cylinders needed to be positioned in the front trenches where they were likely to be ruptured by enemy bombardment. Later, gas was delivered directly to enemy trenches by artillery or mortar shell, reducing friendly casualties significantly. Lingering agents could still affect friendly troops that advanced to enemy trenches following its use.\n\nEarly on, soldiers made improvised [[gas mask]]s by urinating on a handkerchief and putting it over their nose and mouth so the [[urea]] would disable the poison. Armies rushed to issue regulation gas masks as regular equipment for front line troops. Anti-gas equipment and procedures improved significantly during the war, to the point that gas attacks had become less devastating at the war's end.\n\nSeveral different gas agents were used. [[Tear gas]] was first employed in August 1914 by the French, but this could only temporarily disable the enemy. In April 1915, [[chlorine]] gas was first used by Germany at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Exposure to a large dose could kill, and those not killed could suffer permanent lung damage. But the gas was easy to detect by scent and sight. [[Phosgene]], first used in December 1915, was the most lethal killing gas of World War I; it was 18 times more powerful than chlorine and much more difficult to detect.\n\nHowever, the most effective gas was [[mustard gas]], introduced by Germany in July 1917. Mustard gas was not as fatal as phosgene, but it was hard to detect and lingered on the surface of the battlefield, so could inflict casualties over a long period. Even if not inhaled, it could slowly [[Blister agent|burn the skin]], but quickly burned via the eyes or any wounds, causing blindness and intense suffering. Mustard gas also had the property of being heavier than air, causing it to sink down hills and therefore down into trenches. Casualties from mustard gas were unlikely to be fit to fight again, yet only 2% of mustard gas casualties died. The added burden of long-term care of casualties from mustard gas actually increased its overall effectiveness compared to more immediately lethal gas agents.\n\n===Aircraft===\nThe fundamental purpose of the aircraft in trench warfare was [[reconnaissance]] and [[artillery]] observation. [[Aerial reconnaissance]] was so significant in exposing movements, it has been said the trench stalemate was a product of it.<ref>\"Aces: A Story of the First World War\", written by George Pearson, historical advisors Brereton Greenhous & Philip Markham, [[National Film Board of Canada]], 1993.</ref> The role of the [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] was to protect friendly [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and destroy those of the enemy, or at least deny them the freedom of friendly airspace. This involved achieving [[air superiority]] over the battlefield by destroying the enemy's fighters as well.\n\nSpotter aircraft would monitor the fall of shells during registration of the artillery. Reconnaissance aircraft would map trench lines, first with hand-drawn diagrams, later with [[photography]], monitor enemy troop movements, and locate enemy [[artillery batteries]] so that they could be destroyed with [[counter-battery]] fire.\n\n===New weapons===\n[[File:France1918.jpg|thumb|upright|German soldier with [[MP 18]], 1918]]\nIn 1917 and 1918, new types of weapons were fielded. They changed the face of warfare tactics and were later employed during World War II.\n\nThe French introduced the [[Chauchat|CSRG 1915 Chauchat]] during Spring 1916 around the concept of \"[[walking fire]]\", employed in 1918 when 250,000 weapons were fielded.<!--did this contribute to the adoption of the BAR?--> More than 80,000 of the best shooters received the semi-automatic [[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917|RSC 1917]] rifle, allowing them to rapid fire at waves of attacking soldiers. Firing ports were installed in the newly arrived [[Renault FT]] tanks.\n\nThe French Army fielded a ground version of the [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss Canon de 37&nbsp;mm]] used by the French Navy. It was primarily used to destroy German machine gun nests and concrete reinforced pillboxes with high explosive and armour-piercing rounds. \n\nA new type of machine gun was introduced in 1916. Initially an aircraft weapon, the [[Bergmann MG15 nA Gun|Bergmann LMG 15]] was modified for ground use,{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} with the later dedicated ground version being the LMG 15 n. A. It was used as an infantry weapon on all European and Middle Eastern fronts until the end of World War I. It later inspired the [[MG 30]] and the [[MG 34]] as well as the concept of the [[general-purpose machine gun]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nWhat became known as the [[submachine gun]] had its genesis in World War I, developed around the concepts of infiltration and fire and movement, specifically to clear trenches of enemy soldiers when engagements were unlikely to occur beyond a range of a few feet. The [[MP 18]] was the first practical submachine gun used in combat. It was fielded in 1918 by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] as the primary weapon of the [[stormtrooper]]s, assault groups that specialised in trench combat.\n\n==Mining==\n{{main article|Mining (military)}}\n[[File:Mine-explosion-1916.jpg|thumb|Explosion of a mine seen from a French position. 1916]]\n[[File:Battle of the Somme 1916 - Y Sap mine, La Boisselle.jpg|thumb|{{center|Plan of the ''Y Sap'' mine}}]]\nThe dry chalk of the [[River Somme|Somme]] was especially suited to mining, but with the aid of pumps, it was also possible to mine in the sodden clay of [[Flanders]]. Specialist tunneling companies, usually made up of men who had been [[miners]] in civilian life, would dig tunnels under no man's land and beneath the enemy's trenches.<ref>Finlayson, Damien (2010): ''Crumps and Camouflets: Australian Tunnelling Companies on the Western Front.''

The crater served two purposes: it could destroy or breach the enemy's trench and, by virtue of the raised lip that they produced, could provide a ready-made \"trench\" closer to the enemy's line. When a mine was detonated, both sides would race to occupy and fortify the crater.\n\nIf the miners detected an enemy tunnel in progress, they would often [[counter-mine]] and try to drive a tunnel under the enemy's tunnel in which they would detonate explosives to create a [[camouflet]] to destroy the enemy's tunnel. Night raids were also conducted with the sole purpose of destroying the enemy's mine workings. On occasion, mines would cross and fighting would occur underground. The mining skills could also be used to move troops unseen. On one occasion a whole British division was moved through interconnected workings and sewers without German observation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The British detonated [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|19 mines of varying sizes]] on July 1, 1916, the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]. The largest mines\u2014the Y Sap Mine and the [[Lochnagar Mine]]\u2014each containing 24 tons of explosives, were blown near [[La Boiselle]], throwing earth 4,000 feet into the air.{{citation needed|reason=4,000' sounds dubious|date=July 2018}}\n\nAt 3.10 <small>AM</small> on June 7, 1917, a [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|series of mines]] was detonated by the British to launch the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. The average mine contained 21 tons of explosive and the largest, 125 feet beneath [[Sint-Elooi|Saint-Eloi]], was twice the average at 42 tons. As remarked by General Plumer to his staff the evening before the attack:\n\n:\"Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography.\"<ref name=ww1dotcom>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/messines.htm |title=Battles: The Battle of Messines, 1917|website=Firstworldwar.com |accessdate=2008-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe craters from these and many other mines on the Western Front are still visible today. Two undetonated mines remained in the ground near Messines, with their location mislaid after the war. One blew during a thunderstorm in 1955; the other remains in the ground.<ref name=ww1dotcom /> Significant [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mining operations]] were also carried out on the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]].\n\n==Trench battles==\n[[File:Vimy Memorial - German trenches, mortar emplacement.jpg|thumb|German trenches in [[Vimy]]]]\nWhile trenches have often been dug as defensive measures, in the pre-[[firearm]] era, they were mainly a type of hindrance for an attacker of a fortified location, such as the [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] (or [[moat]]) around a [[castle]]. An early example of this can be seen in the [[Battle of the Trench]].\n\nOnly with the advent of accurate firearms did the use of trenches as positions for the defender of a fortification become common. Elaborate trench and bunker systems were employed by the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to withstand British artillery barrages and bayonet charges during the [[New Zealand Wars]] in the 1840s. Trench systems were also employed in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]<ref name=\"Keegan, p. 179\"/> and American Civil War. The military usage evolved very quickly in the First World War, until whole systems of extensive main trenches, backup trenches (in case the first lines were overrun) and communication trenches had been developed, often stretching dozens of kilometres along a front without interruption, and some kilometres further back from the opponent's lines.\n\n===Strategy===\nThe fundamental strategy of trench warfare in World War I was to defend one's own position strongly while trying to achieve a breakthrough into the enemy's rear. The effect was to end up in [[battle of attrition|attrition]]; the process of progressively grinding down the opposition's resources until, ultimately, they are no longer able to wage war. This did not prevent the ambitious commander from pursuing the strategy of annihilation\u2014the ideal of an offensive battle which produces victory in one decisive engagement.\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the British forces during most of World War I, General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], was constantly seeking a \"breakthrough\" which could then be exploited with cavalry divisions. His major trench offensives\u2014the Somme in 1916 and Flanders in 1917\u2014were conceived as breakthrough battles but both degenerated into costly attrition. The Germans actively pursued a strategy of attrition in the [[Battle of Verdun]], the sole purpose of which was to \"bleed the French Army white\". At the same time the Allies needed to mount offensives in order to draw attention away from other hard-pressed areas of the line.{{sfn|Foley|2007|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\n===World War I tactics===\n[[File:Periscope tranch\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise.jpg|thumb|upright|French troopers using a [[periscope]], 1915]]\nThe popular image of a trench assault is of a wave of soldiers, bayonets fixed, going \"over the top\" and marching in a line across no man's land into a hail of enemy fire. This was the standard method early in the war; it was rarely successful.  More common was an attack at night from an advanced post in no man's land, having cut the barbed wire beforehand. In 1915, the Germans innovated with [[infiltration tactics]] where small groups of highly trained and well-equipped troops would attack vulnerable points and bypass strong points, driving deep into the rear areas. The distance they could advance was still limited by their ability to supply and communicate.\n\nThe role of artillery in an infantry attack was twofold. The first aim of a bombardment was to prepare the ground for an infantry assault, killing or demoralising the enemy garrison and destroying their defences. The duration of these initial bombardments varied, from seconds to days. Artillery bombardments prior to infantry assaults were often ineffective at destroying enemy defences, only serving to provide advance notice of an attack. The British bombardment that began the [[Battle of the Somme]] lasted eight days but did little damage to either the German barbed wire or their deep dug-outs, where defenders were able to wait out the bombardment in relative safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/entertainment/14625124.The_Somme_from_the_German_side_of_the_wire/ |title=The Somme from the German side of the wire (From The Northern Echo) |newspaper=Thenorthernecho.co.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= 1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOnce the guns stopped, the defenders had time to emerge and were usually ready for the attacking infantry. The second aim was to protect the attacking infantry by providing an impenetrable \"[[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]\" or curtain of shells to prevent an enemy counter-attack. The first attempt at sophistication was the \"lifting barrage\" where the first objective of an attack was intensely bombarded for a period before the entire barrage \"lifted\" to fall on a second objective farther back. However, this usually expected too much of the infantry, and the usual outcome was that the barrage would outpace the attackers, leaving them without protection.\n\nThis resulted in the use of the \"creeping barrage\" which would lift more frequently but in smaller steps, sweeping the ground ahead and moving so slowly that the attackers could usually follow closely behind it. This became the standard method of attack from late 1916 onward. The main benefit of the barrage was suppression of the enemy rather than to cause casualties or material damage.\n\nCapturing the objective was half the battle, but the battle was only won if the objective was held. The attacking force would have to advance with not only the weapons required to capture a trench but also the tools\u2014sandbags, picks and shovels, barbed wire\u2014to fortify and defend from counter-attack. A successful advance would take the attackers beyond the range of their own field artillery, making them vulnerable, and it took time to move guns up over broken ground. The Germans placed great emphasis on immediately counter-attacking to regain lost ground. This strategy cost them dearly in 1917 when the British started to limit their advances so as to be able to meet the anticipated counter-attack from a position of strength. Part of the British artillery was positioned close behind the original start line and took no part in the initial bombardment, so as to be ready to support later phases of the operation while other guns were moved up.\n\n===World War I communications===\n[[File:British signallers at Sedd-el-Bahr.jpg|thumb|British and French soldiers lay a [[telegraph]] cable in [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], 1915]]\nBecause the battlefield of trench warfare was very deep and hazardous, communications were a major difficulty. Wireless communications were still in their infancy in World War I, so the available methods were [[telephone]], [[telegraph]], [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]], [[signal lamp]]s, [[signal flare]]s, [[homing pigeon]]s, and [[Runner (soldier)|message runners]]. Though telephone was the most effective method, with telegraph a close second, their cables were vulnerable to artillery fire and were often broken early in the battle. To help compensate for this, the cables could be laid in a ladder-like pattern so that multiple redundant lines were available.\n\nFrequently, message delays caused them to be out-of-date by the time they were received. Communication with higher [[division (military)|division]], [[corps]] and [[Field army|army]] [[Headquarters#Military|HQs]] incurred even longer delays, which were doubled if a reply was needed. Some messages were misdirected or lost completely. If a message sent out did not get a reply or confirmation back, the sender could not tell if the original message did not get through, or if it did but the reply did not get back, resulting in confusion worse than if no communication had been attempted.\n\nIt was not uncommon for a commanding officer to wait hours for messages over the course of a battle, making any changes of plans almost impossible. The outcome of many battles was left in the hands of the [[Company (military unit)|company]] and [[platoon]] commanders in the middle of the action, who often had less experience, had very limited additional resources or information, and very limited authority to deviate from the original orders given before the start of the battle. Unable to react to any changing battle situation, many opportunities were lost, and many hopeless attacks persisted.\n\nOnly starting in 1916, on the battlefield of Verdun, came the use of portable small radio stations that could transmit short [[Morse code]]s. [[Radio frequency]] overlap occurred with neighboring divisions until precise regulation and radio discipline developed. Also, enemy interception was common until effective [[codebook]] practices were enforced. These problems were not completely resolved until the war's end.\n\n==World War I \u2013 breaking the stalemate==\n\nThroughout World War I, the major combatants slowly developed different ways of breaking the stalemate of trench warfare; the Germans focused more on new tactics while the British and French focused on [[tank]]s.\n\n===Infiltration tactics===\n{{Main article|Infiltration tactics}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-132-26A, Sto\u00dftrupp.jpg|thumb|German ''[[stormtrooper|Sto\u00dftruppen]]'' (stormtroopers) rising from trenches to attack]]\nAs far back as the 18th century, [[Prussian Army|Prussian military]] doctrine stressed maneuver and force concentration to achieve a decisive battle ({{lang|de|Vernichtungsschlacht}}). The German military searched for ways to apply this in the face of trench warfare. Experiments with new tactics by [[Willy Rohr]], a Prussian captain serving in the [[Vosges mountains]] in 1915, got the attention of the Minister of War. These tactics carried Prussian military doctrine down to smallest units \u2014 specially trained troops maneuvered and massed to assault positions they chose on their own.<ref>Hermann Cron: ''Geschichte des Deutschen Heeres im Welkriege 1914-1918''; Berlin 1937, p. 23</ref> During the next 2 years the German army tried to establish special [[stormtrooper]] detachments in all its units by sending selected men to Rohr and have those men then train their comrades in their original units.\n\nSimilar tactics were developed independently in other countries, such as French Army captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Laffargue|fr}} in 1915, and Russian general [[Aleksei Brusilov]] in 1916, but these failed to be adopted as any military doctrine.<ref>[http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/csir_13/csir_13.asp CSI Report No. 13: Tactical responses to concentrated artillery: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602111844/http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/csir_13/csir_13.asp |date=2011-06-02 }} (Combat Studies Institute, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth).</ref>\n\nThe German stormtrooper methods involved men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down covering fire for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, intended to achieve surprise by disrupting entrenched enemy positions, aimed to bypass strongpoints and to attack the weakest parts of an enemy's line. Additionally, they acknowledged the futility of managing a grand detailed plan of operations from afar, opting instead for junior officers on the spot to exercise initiative.<ref>Hellmuth Gruss: ''Die deutschen Sturmbataillone im Weltkrieg. Aufbau und Verwendung.; Berlin, 1939</ref>\n\nThe Germans employed and improved infiltration tactics in a series of smaller to larger battles, each increasingly successful, leading up to the [[Battle of Caporetto]] against the Italians in 1917, and finally the massive German [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 against the British and French. German infiltration tactics are sometimes called \"Hutier tactics\" by others, after [[Oskar von Hutier]], the general leading the German [[18th Army (German Empire)|18th Army]], which had the farthest advance in that offensive. After a stunningly rapid advance, the offensive failed to achieve a [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]]; German forces stalled after outrunning their supply, artillery, and reinforcements, which could not catch up over the shell-torn ground left ruined by Allied attacks in the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916. The exhausted German forces were soon pushed back in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, and the Germans were unable to organise another major offensive before the war's end. In post-war years, other nations did not fully appreciate these German tactical innovations amidst the overall German defeat.\n\n===Tanks===\n{{Main article|Tanks in World War I}}\n[[File:British Mark IV Tadpole tank.jpg|thumb|This British [[Mark IV tank]] displays a \"tadpole tail\" extension for crossing especially wide trenches]]\nTanks were first introduced by the British as a means to attack enemy trenches, by combining heavy firepower ([[machine gun]]s or [[tank gun|light artillery guns]]), protection from [[small-arms]] fire ([[vehicle armour|armour]]), and battlefield mobility ([[Continuous track|tracks]]). [[British heavy tanks of World War I|These tanks]] were designed with [[rhomboid]]-shaped tracks to easily crush barbed wire lines and cross trenches. They were first deployed in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme in limited numbers, proving unreliable and ineffective at first, as mechanical and logistical issues overshadowed implementing a coherent tank doctrine, with the additional challenge of traversing ground torn apart by years of shell fire. At the [[First Battle of Cambrai]] in 1917, improved tanks in larger numbers demonstrated the potential of tank warfare, though German improvised [[Anti-tank warfare#Anti-tank tactics|anti-tank tactics]], including using direct fire from field artillery, also proved effective.\n[[File:Failed trench crossing.jpg|thumb|Failure of a tank to cross an [[Anti-tank trench|anti-tank trench]]]]\nBy 1918, tank capabilities and tactics improved, their numbers increased and, combined with [[French tanks of World War I|French tanks]], finally helped break the stalemate. During the last 100 days of the war, Allied forces harried the Germans back using infantry supported by tanks and by close air support. By the war's end, tanks become a significant element of warfare; the proposed British [[Plan 1919]] would have employed tanks as a primary factor in military strategy. However, the impact of tanks in World War I was less than it could have been, due to their late introduction and the inherent issues that plague implementing revolutionary technology.\n\nBetween the two world wars many nations developed their own [[Tanks of the interwar period|unique tanks]] and divergent theories of tank tactics, including the UK, France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Japan, the US, and Italy. Though German tank development was restricted by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|treaty ending World War I]], Germany successfully combined their own tanks (plus [[Tanks of Czechoslovakia|Czech tanks]] from [[occupied Czechoslovakia]]) with infiltration tactics to produce [[blitzkrieg]] during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perrett|first1=Bryan|title=A History of Blitzkrieg|date=1983|publisher=Jove Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-515-10234-5|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n===[[European Theatre]]===\n[[File:Hochwald historic photo.jpg|A retractable [[Gun turret|turret]] of [[Ouvrage Hochwald]], one of the largest fortifications of the [[Maginot Line]], 1940|thumb]]\nIn the decade [[Causes of World War II|leading up to World War II]], the French built the [[Maginot Line]], based on their experience with trench warfare in World War I. The Maginot Line was an extensive [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] defensive system far superior to any previous trench system: a chain of massive constructions of concrete, iron, and steel fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, linked by [[tunnel network]]s.  It covered the length of the Franco-German border and was {{convert|20-25|km}} wide. It was supported by numerous underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, with its own telephone network and [[narrow gauge]] railways with [[Armoured train|armoured locomotives]], backed up with heavy [[Railway gun|rail artillery]]. French military experts placed high value on the Line, saying it would curb German aggression, as any invasion force would be halted long enough for French forces to mobilize and counterattack through Belgium. It was only partially successful; in the [[Battle of France]], the main German \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" attack struck through the weakly held [[Ardennes forest]], the gap between the end of the Maginot Line and the advancing Anglo-French mobile forces heading into Belgium. Small secondary German attacks concentrated at a few points in the Line had moderate success. The bulk of the Maginot Line was untouched, and survives today.\n\n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1940 E932.jpg|thumb| A British trench mortar post in North Africa, 1940]]\nThe return of [[Maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]] in World War II reduced the emphasis of trench warfare, as defenders commonly lack the time to build up such battlefield defenses before they are forced to redeploy, due to the more rapidly-changing strategic situation. But trench systems can still be effective locally, wherever mobility was limited, the front lines are static, or around known critical objectives that cannot be bypassed. More quickly improvised [[defensive fighting position]]s, using \"scrapes\" or \"foxholes\", possibly supplemented by [[sand bag]]s, local materials, debris, or rubble, remain in common use. These will typically be improved and expanded by the defenders, eventually becoming full trench systems, if given enough time and resources.\n[[File:Soldati brasiliani a Montese.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] in a trench in [[Montese]] during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of World War II, 1944]]\n\nAt the [[Battle of Sevastopol]], [[Red Army]] forces successfully held trench systems on the narrow peninsula for several months against intense German bombardment. The Western Allies in 1944 broke through the incomplete [[Atlantic Wall]] with relative ease through a combination of amphibious landings, naval gunfire, air attack, and [[airborne troops|airborne]] landings. Combined arms tactics where infantry, artillery, armour and aircraft cooperate closely greatly reduced the importance of trench warfare. It was, however, still a valuable method for reinforcing natural boundaries and creating a line of defence. For example, at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], soldiers on both sides dug trenches within the ruins. In addition, before the start of the [[Battle of Kursk]], the Soviets constructed a system of defence more elaborate than any they built during World War I. These defences succeeded in stopping the German armoured pincers from meeting and enveloping the salient.<ref>Remson, Andrew and Anderson, Debbie. {{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/armysappersforward/kursk.htm |title=World War II Battle of Kursk: Mine/Countermine operations |accessdate=2010-10-10 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026215617/http://geocities.com/armysappersforward/kursk.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }} 25 April 2000, (Prepared for U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate) Section \"The Soviet defense system and minefields\"</ref>\n\n[[File:62. armata a Stalingrado.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers running through the ruins of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], 1942]]                                                                                                      \nThe [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] fought from 1943 until the end of the war in Europe largely consisted of the Allies storming strongly fortified German lines which stretched from one coast, over the mountains to the other coast. When the Allies broke through one line, the Germans would retreat up the peninsula to yet another freshly prepared fortified line.\n\nThe [[Courland Pocket]],formed as a result of successful [[Baltic Offensive]] of the [[Red Army]],exists over seven months between [[9 October]] [[1944]] and [[15 May]] [[1945]],when nearly one hundred and ninety thousand soldiers and officers in [[Army Group Courland]] are unconditionally imprisoned because of\n\u00a0[[German Instrument of Surrender|The surrender of Germany]],before which they successfully defended in almost continuous battles an area of fifteen thousand square kilometers,because of the high concentration of [[Wehrmacht|German forces]],bad weather,wooded andswampy area and inadequate provision of heavy equipment and ammunition of the attacking Soviet forces because of the underestimation of the front as a secondary,as they manage to achieve only limited tactical victories,won for the transfer of the six most capable German divisions on other fronts,significantly weakened the German defense.\n \n\u00a0At the start of the [[Battle of Berlin]], the last major assault on Germany, the Russians [[Battle of the Seelow Heights|attacked over the river]] [[Oder]] against German troops dug in on the [[Seelow Heights]], about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Berlin. Entrenchment allowed the Germans, who were massively outnumbered, to survive a bombardment from the largest concentration of artillery in history; as the Red Army attempted to cross the marshy riverside terrain, they lost tens of thousands of casualties to the entrenched Germans before breaking through.\n\n===Pacific War===\nDuring the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese used a labyrinth of underground fixed positions to slow down the Allied advances on many Pacific Islands. The Japanese built fixed fortifications on [[Iwo Jima]], [[Okinawa]], and [[Guadalcanal]] using a [[tunnel network|system of tunnels]] to interconnect their fortified positions. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defense positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defense against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout the defenses, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking interior lines. This network of [[bunker]]s, tunnels, and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, the Japanese had on [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] several levels of honeycombed fortifications. The Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water and ammo for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Tomb Called Iwo Jima|last=King|first=Dan|publisher=Pacific Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1500343385|location=|pages=58\u201359|quote=|via=}}</ref> The Japanese caused the American advance to slow down and caused massive casualties with these underground fixed positions.

When two large armoured armies meet, the result has generally been mobile warfare of the type which developed in World War II. However, trench warfare reemerged in the latter stages of the [[Chinese Civil War]] ([[Huaihai Campaign]]), the [[Korean War]] (from July 1951 to its end), and at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]] and other later locations and engagements during the [[Vietnam War]]. During the Cold War, [[NATO]] forces routinely trained to fight through extensive works called \"Soviet-style trench systems\", named after the [[Warsaw Pact]]'s complex systems of field fortifications, an extension of Soviet field entrenching practices for which they were famous in their [[Great Patriotic War]] (the Eastern Front of World War II).\n[[File:Ukranian army trench in Donbass.jpg|thumb| Ukrainian soldier in the trenches during the [[War in Donbass]]]]\nAnother example of trench warfare after World Wars I and II was the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], in which both armies lacked training in [[combined arms]] operations. However, both  countries often prepared entrenched defensive positions and [[Tunnel warfare|tunnel]]s to protect and supply the cities and bases throughout the regions. Another problem and success from both sides was their military mobility had reduced, drastically, due to hidden various [[Anti-tank mine|land mines]], and with no firm or stable ground footing it was easy to slide down or even get buried in a camouflaged [[Anti-tank|anti-tank trench]]. Tactics used included trench warfare, machine gun posts, bayonet charges, booby traps, use of barbed wire across trenches and on [[no-man's land]], Iranian [[human wave attack]]s, and Iraq's extensive use of chemical weapons such as [[mustard gas]] against Iranian troops. <ref name=\"Benschopvan der Schans1997\">{{cite journal|last1=Benschop|first1=H.

King [[Rama VII]] bestowed the name '''Phitsanuwittayayon School''' and attended the opening on 7 January 1926, accompanied by Queen [[Ramphaiphanni]]. The school offered two years of training to Thai students who desired to become teachers in government schools.\n\nA separate women's teacher training institution opened in 1933, and in 1956 both were combined to create '''Pibulsongkram Teachers College''', named for then Prime Minister Field Marshal [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]]. The teachers college began offering a bachelor of education degree in 1976.

The township, which sits in a glacier-carved basin on the shores of the lake, is the gateway to [[Mount Aspiring National Park|Mt Aspiring National Park]]. [[Lake H\u0101wea]] is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of [[Makarora]], the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic [[Cardrona Valley]], a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].\n\n===Geology===\nAt its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north\u2013south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake's western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower.\n\nLake W\u0101naka lies in a [[u-shaped valley]] formed by [[glacier|glacial]] erosion during the last [[ice age]], more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the [[Matukituki River|Matukituki]] and [[Makarora River]]s, and is the source of the [[Clutha River]].

[[Lake H\u0101wea]] is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of [[Makarora]], the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic [[Cardrona Valley]], a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].\n\n===Geology===\nAt its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north\u2013south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake's western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower.\n\nLake W\u0101naka lies in a [[u-shaped valley]] formed by [[glacier|glacial]] erosion during the last [[ice age]], more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the [[Matukituki River|Matukituki]] and [[Makarora River]]s, and is the source of the [[Clutha River]].
