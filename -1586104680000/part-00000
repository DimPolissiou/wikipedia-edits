Bancroft was in good form during the match scoring a penalty goal and a conversion. Two tries were scored by Wales in an 11-3 win, one from [[Viv Huzzey]] and the other scored by Dobson himself; his first and only international score.

It began among the Turkmen tribes of the [[Taurus mountains]], before spreading to a wide variety of disgruntled groups.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christine Woodhead|title=The Ottoman World|date=15 Dec 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136498947|page=94}}</ref> It is named after the leader of the rebels, [[\u015eahkulu]]. His death in battle also meant the end of the uprising.\n{{Alevism|Alevi history}}\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Safavid dynasty]] was consolidated and founded by [[Ismail I]] in the early 16th century. Ismail, being a champion of [[Shiite]] faith and partially a [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]], was also sympathetic to the Turkmens of Ottoman Empire. \n\nThe [[Qizilbash]], Anatolian adherents to the [[Safavid order]], held a strong presence across [[Anatolia]] from the late 15th century to the mid-16th century, and assumed a central role in the \u015eahkulu rebellion. In the decades preceding the events of the rebellion, due to the fluid religious character of the region, the primarily [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Ottoman state demonstrated a notable tolerance towards [[Shia Islam]]. However, beginning in the early 16th century, this tolerance began to recede; according to official Ottoman terminology from the period, a [[Qizilbash]] was a rebel heretic suspected of illicit relationships with the Safavids<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Zarinebaf-Shahr|first=Fariba|date=1997|title=Q\u0131z\u0131lbash \"Heresy\" and Rebellion in Ottoman Anatolia During the Sixteenth Century|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/anatm_1297-8094_1997_num_7_1_946|journal=Anatolia Moderna.

Some ascribe this receding tolerance to the decline of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] coupled with the emerging socio-political legitimacy of the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid empire]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThough the revolt was incited by \u015eahkulu among the Qizilbash, numbered among the eventual participants were various non-Qizilbash groups, such as former [[Sipahi|sipahis]], dispossessed Gazis, and other [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] peoples<ref>{{Cite book|last=Somel, Sel\u00e7uk Aksin, Auteur.|title=Historical dictionary of the Ottoman Empire|date=2012|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7168-7|oclc=819159189}}</ref>. This decrease in tolerance contributed in part to the malcontent of the Turkmen tribes in Anatolia towards the Ottoman State. Their refusal to pay state taxes, settle down, and accept Ottoman central control pushed these Turkmen tribes towards a more militant form of Shi\u2019ism<ref name=\":0\" />. This same malcontent would lead to multiple uprisings in Eastern Anatolia headed by tribal leaders.\n\nBeing inspired by Safavid missionaries, the Turkmens living on Ottoman soil, \"as far west as [[Konya]]\", were mobilized in a \"fervent messianic movement\", led by \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \u015eahkulu and his followers tried to \"replicate\" the same type of revolt led by [[Ismail I]] several years earlier, \"perhaps in anticipation of a union with the Safavids\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \nIsmail I's activities did not escape the attention of the Ottomans, but the Ottoman Empire was too preoccupied with the oncoming period of interregnum during the last years of the crippled sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Thus Ismail was able to gain many supporters among Ottoman subjects. One such supporter was ''\u015eahkulu'' (meaning ''\"servant of the [[shah]]\"''), a member of the Turkmen Tekkelu tribe.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\n== Course of events ==\nDuring the early days of interregnum, [[\u015eehzade Korkut|Korkut]], one of the princes ({{lang-tr|\u015eehzade}}), was travelling from Antalya to [[Manisa]] to be closer to capital. \u015eahkulu raided his caravan and robbed the treasury. Then he began attacking the towns and killing the government officers in the towns. He also raided [[Ala\u015fehir]] to seize a part of royal treasure. Only then, an Ottoman force under [[Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pasha]], the [[beylerbey]] of [[Anatolia|Anadolu]]  was sent to check his activities. But \u015eahkulu defeated the forces of Ahmet Pasha and executed him. This increased the fame and the prestige of \u015eahkulu. To his partisans, after raiding a royal caravan and killing a high-ranking Ottoman statesman, he was invincible. A second army was sent after him. The commanders of the army were [[\u015eehzade Ahmet]], one of the claimants to throne, and the grand vizier [[Had\u0131m Ali Pasha]]. They were able to corner \u015eahkulu near [[Alt\u0131nta\u015f]] (in modern [[K\u00fctahya Province]]), but instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the Janissaries for his cause. Failing to achieve, he left the battlefield. \u015eahkulu saw his chance and escaped. Ali Pasha with a smaller force chased him, and clashed with him at \u00c7ubukova between [[Kayseri]] and [[Sivas]].<ref>Nicolae Jorga:'' Geschiste des Osmanichen vol II'', (trans: Nil\u00fcfer Ep\u00e7eli) Yeditepe Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 2009, {{ISBN|975-6480-19-X}} ,p.217</ref> The battle was a draw, but both Ali Pasha and \u015eahkulu were killed (July 1511).<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi Cilt II'', AKDTYKTTK Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 p 225-226</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\u015eahkulu's partisans were not defeated, but they had lost their leader. Many scattered, but after a third army was sent by the [[Ottoman Porte]], the most devoted escaped to Persia. During their escape they raided a caravan, and accidentally killed a well-known Persian scholar. Consequently, instead of showing them hospitality, Ismail executed them. Meanwhile, in Ottoman lands, Prince Ahmet's behavior in the battle caused reaction among the soldiers. Moreover, the death of Had\u0131m Ali, the chief partisan of Ahmet, provided an advantage to the youngest claimants to throne: the succession would ultimately fall to [[Selim I]], under whose reign the Ottoman state saw spectacular victories and doubled in area. Selim was also a very devoted [[Sunni]] and effectively checked Shiite activities in Ottoman lands after defeating Ismail in the [[battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514.\n\nBut the anxiety of the Ottomans, in relation to \"losing much of their Asian possessions was not eased\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} Nor did the hatred of the Ottomans for Ismail I cease to exist, even though Ismail apologized for the atrocities caused by the Turkmens and \"disowned\" \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\nAs the possibility existed of a \"mass Turkmen exodus into the Safavid realm\", [[Bayezid II]] sought to establish good relations with Ismail, \"at least on the surface, and welcomed Ismail's gestures to establish good neighborly relations\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} In letters sent to Ismail, Bayezid II addressed Ismail as \"heir to the kingdom of [[Kay Khosrow|Kaykhosrow]] \u2013 the legendary great king of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' \u2013 and to Dara ([[Darius I|Darius]]) of the [[Achaemenid Empire|ancient Persian Empire]]\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} [[Abbas Amanat]] adds: \"He further advised Ismail to behave royally, preserve his precious and strategically vital kingdom with justice and equanimity, end forced conversions, and leave in peace with his neighbors\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\nThe political environment which resulted from this revolt would lead the next Ottoman Sultan, [[Selim I]], to take violent measures against the Qizilbash and declare war on Iran<ref name=\":0\" />. Counted among these violent measures was the decree from Selim I to kill more than 40,000 Qizilbash, children and elderly included, in [[Rumelia]] and Anatolia prior to the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in March 1514<ref>Anonymous, \"Selimn\u00e2me,\" Topkapi Sarayi Library, Revan 1540, folio 10 a (Unpublished manuscript)</ref>. In undated letters from Selim I sent to [[Ismail I|Isma'il I]], estimated to have been written in 1514, Selim I wrote that \"it has been heard repeatedly that you have subjected the upright community of Muhammad to your devious will\" and expounded upon his plans to \"crown the head of every gallows tree with a crown-wearing Sufi and clear the faction from the face of the earth\".\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Amanat |first1=Abbas |authorlink1=Abbas Amanat |title=Iran: A Modern History |date=2017 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300231465|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = \u010c\u0100LDER\u0100N | last1 = McCaffrey | first1 = Michael J. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/calderan-battle | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. IV, Fasc. 6 | pages = 656\u2013658 | location = | publisher = | year = 1990 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = ESM\u0100\u02bf\u012aL I \u1e62AFAW\u012a | last1 = Savory | first1 = Roger | authorlink1 = Roger Savory | last2 = Karamustafa | first2 = Ahmet T. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/esmail-i-safawi | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VIII, Fasc. 6 | pages = 628\u2013636 | location = | publisher = | year = 1998 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Savory|first1=Roger|title=Iran Under the Safavids|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521042512|page=40|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Rebellions in the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sahkulu Rebellion}}\n[[Category:Rebellions against the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1511]]\n[[Category:16th-century rebellions]]\n[[Category:1511 in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Safavid Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= \u015eahkulu rebellion\n|partof=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|date= 1511\n|place=Anatolia\n|coordinates=\n| map_type    =\n| latitude    =\n| longitude   =\n| map_size    =\n| map_caption =\n| map_label   =\n| result      = Ottoman victory\n| status      =\n| combatant1  = [[Qizilbash]] Rebels\n| combatant2  = {{flag|Ottoman Empire}}\n| commander1  = [[\u015eahkulu]]{{KIA}}\n| commander2  = {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} [[Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pasha]]<br /> {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} [[Had\u0131m Ali Pasha]]{{KIA}}<br /> {{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} [[\u015eehzade Ahmet]]\n| strength1   =\n| strength2   =\n| casualties1 =\n| casualties2 =\n| notes       =\n}}\nThe '''\u015eahkulu rebellion''' (9 April \u2013 2 July 1511){{citation needed|date=July 2011}} was a widespread pro-[[Shia]] and pro-[[Safavid]] uprising in [[Anatolia]], directed against the [[Ottoman Empire]], in 1511.

This same malcontent would lead to multiple uprisings in Eastern Anatolia headed by tribal leaders.\n\nBeing inspired by Safavid missionaries, the Turkmens living on Ottoman soil, \"as far west as [[Konya]]\", were mobilized in a \"fervent messianic movement\", led by \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \u015eahkulu and his followers tried to \"replicate\" the same type of revolt led by [[Ismail I]] several years earlier, \"perhaps in anticipation of a union with the Safavids\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} \nIsmail I's activities did not escape the attention of the Ottomans, but the Ottoman Empire was too preoccupied with the oncoming period of interregnum during the last years of the crippled sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Thus Ismail was able to gain many supporters among Ottoman subjects. One such supporter was ''\u015eahkulu'' (meaning ''\"servant of the [[shah]]\"''), a member of the Turkmen Tekkelu tribe.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\n== Course of events ==\nDuring the early days of interregnum, [[\u015eehzade Korkut|Korkut]], one of the princes ({{lang-tr|\u015eehzade}}), was travelling from Antalya to [[Manisa]] to be closer to capital. \u015eahkulu raided his caravan and robbed the treasury. Then he began attacking the towns and killing the government officers in the towns. He also raided [[Ala\u015fehir]] to seize a part of royal treasure. Only then, an Ottoman force under [[Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pasha]], the [[beylerbey]] of [[Anatolia|Anadolu]]  was sent to check his activities. But \u015eahkulu defeated the forces of Ahmet Pasha and executed him. This increased the fame and the prestige of \u015eahkulu. To his partisans, after raiding a royal caravan and killing a high-ranking Ottoman statesman, he was invincible. A second army was sent after him. The commanders of the army were [[\u015eehzade Ahmet]], one of the claimants to throne, and the grand vizier [[Had\u0131m Ali Pasha]]. They were able to corner \u015eahkulu near [[Alt\u0131nta\u015f]] (in modern [[K\u00fctahya Province]]), but instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the Janissaries for his cause. Failing to achieve, he left the battlefield. \u015eahkulu saw his chance and escaped. Ali Pasha with a smaller force chased him, and clashed with him at \u00c7ubukova between [[Kayseri]] and [[Sivas]].<ref>Nicolae Jorga:'' Geschiste des Osmanichen vol II'', (trans: Nil\u00fcfer Ep\u00e7eli) Yeditepe Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 2009, {{ISBN|975-6480-19-X}} ,p.217</ref> The battle was a draw, but both Ali Pasha and \u015eahkulu were killed (July 1511).<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi Cilt II'', AKDTYKTTK Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 p 225-226</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\u015eahkulu's partisans were not defeated, but they had lost their leader. Many scattered, but after a third army was sent by the [[Ottoman Porte]], the most devoted escaped to Persia. During their escape they raided a caravan, and accidentally killed a well-known Persian scholar. Consequently, instead of showing them hospitality, Ismail executed them. Meanwhile, in Ottoman lands, Prince Ahmet's behavior in the battle caused reaction among the soldiers. Moreover, the death of Had\u0131m Ali, the chief partisan of Ahmet, provided an advantage to the youngest claimants to throne: the succession would ultimately fall to [[Selim I]], under whose reign the Ottoman state saw spectacular victories and doubled in area. Selim was also a very devoted [[Sunni]] and effectively checked Shiite activities in Ottoman lands after defeating Ismail in the [[battle of Chaldiran]] in 1514.\n\nBut the anxiety of the Ottomans, in relation to \"losing much of their Asian possessions was not eased\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} Nor did the hatred of the Ottomans for Ismail I cease to exist, even though Ismail apologized for the atrocities caused by the Turkmens and \"disowned\" \u015eahkulu.{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\nAs the possibility existed of a \"mass Turkmen exodus into the Safavid realm\", [[Bayezid II]] sought to establish good relations with Ismail, \"at least on the surface, and welcomed Ismail's gestures to establish good neighborly relations\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} In letters sent to Ismail, Bayezid II addressed Ismail as \"heir to the kingdom of [[Kay Khosrow|Kaykhosrow]] \u2013 the legendary great king of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' \u2013 and to Dara ([[Darius I|Darius]]) of the [[Achaemenid Empire|ancient Persian Empire]]\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}} [[Abbas Amanat]] adds: \"He further advised Ismail to behave royally, preserve his precious and strategically vital kingdom with justice and equanimity, end forced conversions, and leave in peace with his neighbors\".{{sfn|Amanat|2017|page=52}}\n\nThe political environment which resulted from this revolt would lead the next Ottoman Sultan, [[Selim I]], to take violent measures against the Qizilbash and declare war on Iran<ref name=\":0\" />. Counted among these violent measures was the decree from Selim I to kill more than 40,000 Qizilbash, children and elderly included, in [[Rumelia]] and Anatolia prior to the [[Battle of Chaldiran]] in March 1514<ref>Anonymous, \"Selimn\u00e2me,\" Topkapi Sarayi Library, Revan 1540, folio 10 a (Unpublished manuscript)</ref>. In undated letters from Selim I sent to [[Ismail I|Isma'il I]], estimated to have been written in 1514, Selim I wrote that \"it has been heard repeatedly that you have subjected the upright community of Muhammad to your devious will\" and expounded upon his plans to \"crown the head of every gallows tree with a crown-wearing Sufi and clear the faction from the face of the earth\".\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Amanat |first1=Abbas |authorlink1=Abbas Amanat |title=Iran: A Modern History |date=2017 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300231465|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = \u010c\u0100LDER\u0100N | last1 = McCaffrey | first1 = Michael J. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/calderan-battle | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. IV, Fasc. 6 | pages = 656\u2013658 | location = | publisher = | year = 1990 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | article = ESM\u0100\u02bf\u012aL I \u1e62AFAW\u012a | last1 = Savory | first1 = Roger | authorlink1 = Roger Savory | last2 = Karamustafa | first2 = Ahmet T. | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/esmail-i-safawi | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. VIII, Fasc. 6 | pages = 628\u2013636 | location = | publisher = | year = 1998 | isbn = |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Savory|first1=Roger|title=Iran Under the Safavids|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521042512|page=40|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Rebellions in the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sahkulu Rebellion}}\n[[Category:Rebellions against the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1511]]\n[[Category:16th-century rebellions]]\n[[Category:1511 in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Safavid Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Tasase5", "label": "safe", "comment": "It seems Karag\u00f6z Ahmet Pa\u015fa was also killed by \u015eahkulu forces as the page says.

They total approximately {{convert|2.5|km2|sqmi|1}} in area, where McDonald Island is {{convert|1.13|km2|sqmi|1}}.

Many of these wetland areas are separated by active glaciers. There are also several short glacier-fed streams and glacial pools. Some wetland areas have been recorded on McDonald Island but, due to substantial volcanic activity since the last landing was made in 1980, their present extent is unknown.\n\nThe HIMI wetland is listed on the [[Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia]] and, in a recent analysis of Commonwealth-managed wetlands, was ranked highest for nomination under the [[Ramsar Convention|Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)]] as an internationally important wetland.\n\nSix wetland types have been identified from HIMI covering approximately 1860 ha: coastal \u2018pool complex\u2019 (237 ha); inland \u2018pool complex\u2019 (105 ha); vegetated seeps mostly on recent glaciated areas (18 ha); glacial lagoons (1103 ha); non-glacial lagoons (97ha); Elephant Spit (300 ha) plus some coastal areas. On Heard Island, the majority of these types suites are found below 150&nbsp;m asl. The wetland vegetation occurs in the \u2018wet mixed herbfield\u2019 and \u2018coastal biotic vegetation\u2019 communities described above.\n\nThe wetlands provide important breeding and feeding habitat for a number of Antarctic and subantarctic wetland animals. These include the southern elephant seal and macaroni, gentoo, king and southern rockhopper penguins, considered to be wetland species under the Ramsar Convention. Non-wetland vegetated parts of the islands also support penguin and other seabird colonies.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Heard Island Karman vortex street.jpg|thumb|[[Vortex shedding]] as winds pass Heard Island resulted in this [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] in the clouds]]\nThe islands have an Antarctic climate, tempered by their maritime setting. The weather is marked by low seasonal and daily temperature ranges, persistent and generally low cloud cover, frequent precipitation and strong winds. Snowfall occurs throughout the year. Monthly average temperatures at [[Atlas Cove]] (at the northwestern end of Heard Island) range from {{convert|0.0|to|4.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, with an average daily range of {{convert|3.7|to|5.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer and {{convert|-0.8|to|0.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter. The winds are predominantly westerly and persistently strong. At Atlas Cove, monthly average wind speeds range between around {{convert|26|and|33.5|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Gusts in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} have been recorded. Annual precipitation at sea level on Heard Island is in the order of {{convert|1300|to|1900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}; rain or snow falls on about 3 out of 4 days.<ref>HIMI official website.</ref>\n\nMeteorological records at Heard Island are incomplete.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Heard Island, 12 m asl (1981\u20132010 normals) \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.0\n|Mar record high C = 19.9\n|Apr record high C = 20.4\n|May record high C = 19.3\n|Jun record high C = 14.0\n|Jul record high C = 15.0\n|Aug record high C = 15.4\n|Sep record high C = 16.8\n|Oct record high C = 16.4\n|Nov record high C = 14.6\n|Dec record high C = 19.2\n|Jan high C = 6.4\n|Feb high C = 6.5\n|Mar high C = 6.3\n|Apr high C = 5.3\n|May high C = 3.7\n|Jun high C = 2.3\n|Jul high C = 2.2\n|Aug high C = 2.2\n|Sep high C = 2.2\n|Oct high C = 3.3\n|Nov high C = 4.1\n|Dec high C = 5.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.7\n|Feb mean C = 4.8\n|Mar mean C = 4.6\n|Apr mean C = 3.6\n|May mean C = 2.2\n|Jun mean C = 0.9\n|Jul mean C = 0.5\n|Aug mean C = 0.4\n|Sep mean C = 0.5\n|Oct mean C = 1.5\n|Nov mean C = 2.4\n|Dec mean C = 3.8\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 3.0\n|Feb low C = 3.1\n|Mar low C = 2.8\n|Apr low C = 1.9\n|May low C = 0.7\n|Jun low C = -0.6\n|Jul low C = -1.1\n|Aug low C = -1.4\n|Sep low C = -1.1\n|Oct low C = -0.2\n|Nov low C = 0.7\n|Dec low C = 2.1\n|year low C = \n|Jan record low C = -0.5\n|Feb record low C = 0.2\n|Mar record low C = -1.7\n|Apr record low C = -2.9\n|May record low C = -4.8\n|Jun record low C = -7.2\n|Jul record low C = -6.2\n|Aug record low C = -11.5\n|Sep record low C = -8.6\n|Oct record low C = -7.1\n|Nov record low C = -6.2\n|Dec record low C = -0.7\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm = \n|Feb precipitation mm =  \n|Mar precipitation mm = \n|Apr precipitation mm = \n|May precipitation mm =  \n|Jun precipitation mm =  \n|Jul precipitation mm = \n|Aug precipitation mm = \n|Sep precipitation mm = \n|Oct precipitation mm =  \n|Nov precipitation mm = \n|Dec precipitation mm = \n|year precipitation mm = \n|unit precipitation days = 1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  \n|Feb precipitation days =  \n|Mar precipitation days =  \n|Apr precipitation days =  \n|May precipitation days =  \n|Jun precipitation days =  \n|Jul precipitation days =  \n|Aug precipitation days =  \n|Sep precipitation days =  \n|Oct precipitation days =  \n|Nov precipitation days =  \n|Dec precipitation days =  \n|year precipitation days = \n|source 1=  M\u00e9t\u00e9o climat stats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-p97.php|title=Moyennes 1961-1990 Australie (Ile Heard)|language=fr|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2= M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat <ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/station-31.php|title=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat stats for Ile Heard |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Constraints ====\nThe islands are part of the [[Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] that includes several [[subantarctic]] islands. In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and [[moss]]es.<ref>[http://heardisland.antarctica.gov.au/nature/plants Plants]. Australian Department of the Environment, Australian Antarctic Division. Updated 28 February 2005.</ref> Low plant diversity reflects the islands\u2019 isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, salt spray exposure, nutrient availability, disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to salt spray and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.\n\n==== History ====\nEvidence from microfossil records indicates that ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the [[Tertiary]] (a period with a cool and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.\n\n==== Flowering plants and ferns ====\nLow-growing [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] flowering plants and [[bryophyte]]s are the major vegetation components. The vascular flora comprises the smallest number of species of any major subantarctic island group, reflecting its isolation, small ice-free area and severe climate. Twelve vascular species are known from Heard Island, of which five have also been recorded on McDonald Island. None of the vascular species is endemic, although ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Colobanthus kerguelensis]]'', and ''[[Poa kerguelensis]]'' occur only on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plants are typically subantarctic, but with a higher abundance of the cushion-forming ''[[Azorella selago]]'' than other subantarctic islands. Heard Island is the largest subantarctic island with no confirmed human-introduced plants. Areas available for plant colonisation on Heard Island are generally the result of retreating glaciers or new ice-free land created by lava flows. Today, substantial vegetation covers over 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Heard Island, and is best developed on coastal areas at elevations below 250&nbsp;m.\n\n==== Mosses and liverworts ====\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) contribute substantially to the overall biodiversity of Heard Island, with 43 mosses and 19 liverworts being recorded, often occupying habitats unsuitable for vascular plants, such as cliff faces. Bryophytes are present in most of the major vegetation communities including several soil and moss-inhabiting species. A 1980 survey of McDonald Island found lower diversity than that on Heard Island; four mosses and a number of algal species are recorded from there.\n\n==== Algae ====\nAt least 100 species of terrestrial algae are known from Heard Island, commonly in permanently moist and ephemeral habitats. Forests of the giant Antarctic kelp ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' occur at a number of sites around Heard Island and at least 17 other species of seaweed are known, with more to be added following the identification of recent collections. Low seaweed diversity is due to the island's isolation from other land masses, unsuitable beach habitat, constant abrasion by waves, tides and small stones, and the extension of glaciers into the sea in many areas.\n\n==== Vegetation communities ====\nHeard Island has a range of terrestrial environments in which vegetation occurs. Seven general vegetation communities are currently recognised, although vegetation composition is considered more of a continuum than discrete units:\n* [[Subantarctic]] vegetation is minimal and includes small types of shrubbery, including mosses and liverworts.\n* [[cushion plant|Open cushionfield]] vegetation is the most widespread and abundant vegetation type on Heard Island. It is characterised by ''[[Azorella selago]]'' cushions interspersed with bryophytes, small vascular species and bare ground with 20\u201375% cover, and found mainly at altitudes between 30\u201370m asl.\n* [[Fellfield]] describes vegetation with abundant bare ground and less than 50% plant cover. Fellfield may occur as a result of harsh climatic and/or edaphic factors, or recent [[deglaciation]] which has exposed bare ground.\n* [[Moss]]y [[fellfield]] is a community with high species richness and consists of bryophytes and small ''Azorella selago'' cushions. It is found at altitudes between 30\u2013150&nbsp;m in areas with intermediate exposure.\n* [[Herbfield|Wet mixed herbfield]] occurs on moist substrate, mostly on moraines and moist lee slopes (often in association with burrowing petrels colonies) at low altitude (< 40&nbsp;m) where the water table is at or close to the surface. Species richness is highest here of all the communities, with dominant species being ''[[Poa cookii]]'', ''Azorella selago'', ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Acaena magellanica]]'', and ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]''.\n* [[Coastal Strand|Coastal biotic]] vegetation is dominated by ''Poa cookii'' and ''Azorella selago'', occurring mainly on coastal sites of moderate exposure and in areas subject to significant influence from seals and seabirds.\n* [[Supralittoral zone|Saltspray vegetation]] is dominated by the salt-tolerant moss ''[[Muelleriella crassifolia]]'' and limited in extent, being found at low elevations on lavas in exposed coastal sites.\n* [[cushion plant|Closed cushionfield]] is found on moraines and sand at altitudes mostly below 60&nbsp;m, and is dominated almost entirely by ''Azorella selago'' cushions that often grow together to form continuous carpets which can be subject to burrowing by seabirds.\n\n==== Outlook ====\nOne of the most rapidly changing physical settings in the subantarctic has been produced on Heard Island by a combination of rapid glacial recession and climate warming.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The consequent increase in habitat available for plant colonisation, plus the coalescing of previously discrete ice-free areas, has led to marked changes in the vegetation of Heard Island in the last 20 years or so. Other species and vegetation communities found on subantarctic islands north of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] now absent from the Heard Island flora may colonise the island if climate change produces more favourable conditions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSome plant species are spreading and modifying the structure and composition of communities, some of which are also increasing in distribution. It is likely that further changes will occur, and possibly at an accelerated rate. Changes in population numbers of seal and seabird species are also expected to affect the vegetation by changing nutrient availability and disturbance through trampling.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOne plant species on Heard Island, ''[[Poa annua]]'', a cosmopolitan grass native to Europe, was possibly introduced by humans, though is more likely to have arrived naturally, probably by [[skua]]s from the Kerguelen Islands where it is widespread. It was initially recorded in 1987 in two deglaciated areas of Heard Island not previously exposed to human visitors, while being absent from known sites of past human habitation. Since 1987 ''Poa annua'' populations have increased in density and abundance within the original areas and have expanded beyond them. Expeditioner boot traffic during the Australian Antarctic program expedition in 1987 may be at least partly responsible for the spread, but it is probably mainly due to dispersal by wind and the movement of seabirds and seals around the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe potential for introducing plant species (including invasive species not previously found on subantarctic islands) by both natural and human-induced means is high. This is due to the combination of low species diversity and climatic amelioration. During the 2003/04 summer a new plant species, ''[[Cotula plumosa]]'', was recorded. Only one small specimen was found growing on a coastal river terrace that had experienced substantial development and expansion of vegetation over the past decade. The species has a circumantarctic distribution and occurs on many subantarctic islands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=P. A. M.|last2=Scott|first2=J. J.|last3=Rozefelds|first3=A.

Both the shag and the sheathbill are endemic to Heard Island.\n\nA further 28 seabird species are recorded as either non-breeding visitors or have been noted during 'at-sea surveys' of the islands. All recorded breeding species, other than the Heard Island sheathbill, are listed marine species under the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act (1999, four are listed as threatened species and five are listed migratory species.

The king penguin population is the best studied seabird species on Heard Island and has shown a dramatic increase since first recorded in 1947/48, with the population doubling every five years or so for more than 50 years.\n\nA paper reviewing population data for the black-browed albatross between 1947 and 2000/01 suggested that the breeding population had increased to approximately three times that present in the late 1940s,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woehler |first=E.

The discovery of a large, previously unknown, colony of Heard shags in 2000/01 at Cape Pillar raised the known breeding population from 200 pairs to over 1000 pairs.<ref name=\"Woehler, E.J. 2006\"/> The breeding population of southern giant petrels decreased by more than 50% between the early 1950s and the late 1980s.\n\n==== Terrestrial, freshwater and coastal invertebrates ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\nHeard Island supports a relatively low number of terrestrial invertebrate species compared to other Southern Ocean islands, in parallel with the low species richness in the flora\u2013that is, the island's isolation and limited ice-free area. [[Endemism]] is also generally low and the invertebrate fauna is exceptionally pristine with few, if any, (successful) human-induced introductions of alien species.\nTwo species, including the thrips ''Apterothrips apteris'' and the mite ''[[Tyrophagus putrescentiae]]'' are thought to be recent, possibly natural, introductions. An exotic species of earthworm ''[[Dendrodrilus rubidus]]'' was also collected in 1929 from a dump near Atlas Cove, and has recently been collected from a variety of habitats including wallows, streams and lakes on Heard Island.\n\nThe arthropods of Heard Island are comparatively well known with 54 species of [[mite]] and [[tick]], one [[spider]] and eight [[springtail]]s recorded. A study over summer at Atlas Cove in 1987/88 showed overall densities of up to 60 000 individual springtails per square metre in soil under stands of ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''. Despite a few recent surveys, the non-arthropod invertebrate fauna of Heard Island remain poorly known.\n\nBeetles and flies dominate Heard Island's known insect fauna, which comprises up to 21 species of ectoparasite (associated with birds and seals) and up to 13 free-living species. Approximately half of the free-living insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found in a variety of habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, ''[[Poa cookii]]'' and ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' stands, [[bryophyte]]s, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a negative relationship between altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.\n\nThe fauna of the freshwater pools, lakes, streams and mires found in the coastal areas of Heard Island are broadly similar to those on other subantarctic islands of the southern Indian Ocean. Many species reported from Heard Island are found elsewhere. Some sampling of freshwater fauna has been undertaken during recent expeditions and records to date indicate that the freshwater fauna includes a species of [[Protista]], a gastrotrich, two species of [[tardigrade]], at least four species of nematode, 26 species of rotifer, six species of annelid and 14 species of arthropod.\n\nAs with the other shore biota, the marine macro-invertebrate fauna of Heard Island is similar in composition and local distribution to other subantarctic islands, although relatively little is known about the Heard Island communities compared with the well-studied fauna of some other islands in the subantarctic region, such as [[Macquarie Island|Macquarie]] and Kerguelen.\n\nDespite Heard Island's isolation, species richness is considered to be moderate, rather than depauperate, although the number of endemic species reported is low. The large macro-alga ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' supports a diverse array of invertebrate taxa and may play an important role in transporting some of this fauna to Heard Island.\n\nThe rocky shores of Heard Island exhibit a clear demarcation between fauna of the lower kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet ''Nacella kerguelensis'' is abundant in the lower part of the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton ''[[Hemiarthrum setulosum]]'' and the starfish ''Anasterias mawsoni''. The amphipod ''Hyale'' sp. and the isopod ''Cassidinopsis'' sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid ''Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis'' and the bivalve mollusc ''Kidderia bicolor'' are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve ''Gaimardia trapesina trapesina'' has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FMIB 46007 Antarctic Sea-Elephant Fishery.jpeg|thumb|right|Heard Island 1887 by [[Henry Wood Elliott]]<ref>Goode, George Brown (1887) Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1887).</ref>]]\nNeither island-cluster had recorded visitors until the mid-1850s.\n\nAn American sailor, John Heard, on the ship ''Oriental'', sighted Heard Island on 25 November 1853, en route from [[Boston]] to Melbourne.

William McDonald aboard the ''Samarang'' [[1854 in Australia#Exploration and settlement|discovered the nearby McDonald Islands]] six weeks later, on 4 January 1854.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&pg=PA342&lpg=PA342&dq=peter+kemp+magnet+kerguelen#v=onepage&q=heard%20island&f=false | title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia| isbn=9781576074220| last1=Mills| first1=William James| year=2003}}</ref>\n\nNo landing took place on the islands until March 1855, when sealers from the ''Corinthian'', led by [[Erasmus Darwin Rogers]], went ashore at a place called Oil Barrel Point. In the sailing period from 1855 to 1880 a number of American sealers spent a year or more on the island, living in appalling conditions in dark smelly huts, also at Oil Barrel Point. At its peak the community consisted of 200 people. By 1880 sealers had wiped out most of the seal population and then left the island. In all the islands furnished more than 100,000 barrels of [[elephant seal|elephant-seal]] oil during this period.\n\nA number of wrecks have occurred in the vicinity of the islands. There is also a discarded building left from John Heard's sealing station which is situated near Atlas Cove.\n\nThe first recorded landing on McDonald Island was made by Australian scientists Grahame Budd and Hugh Thelander on 12 February 1971, using a helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|title=SIOE 2002: Heard I. & The McDonald Is|date=1 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052000/http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|archive-date=26 April 2012|last=Cerchi|first=Dan|website=www.cerchi.net}}</ref><ref name=\"aad\">{{cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406140708/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177  |archivedate=2011-04-06 |url-status=dead |title=Gazetteer - AADC Name Details - Australian Antarctic Data Centre |via=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|website=[[Australian Antarctic Data Centre]]}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have been a territory of Australia since 1947, when they were transferred from the UK.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/> The archipelago became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997.\n\nThere were at least five private expeditions to Heard Island between 1965 and 2000.

The transfer was confirmed by an exchange of letters between the two governments on 19 December 1950.\n\nThe islands are a territory (Territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands) of Australia administered from [[Hobart]] by the [[Australian Antarctic Division]] of the Australian [[Department of the Environment and Energy]]. The administration of the territory is established in the ''Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953'', which places it under the laws of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2008C00326|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref> The islands are contained within a {{convert|65000|km2|sqmi|adj=on}} marine reserve and are primarily visited for research, meaning that there is no permanent human habitation.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/>\n\nFrom 1947 until 1955 there were camps of visiting scientists on Heard Island (at [[Atlas Cove]] in the northwest, which was in 1969 again occupied by American scientists and expanded in 1971 by French scientists) and in 1971 on McDonald Island (at [[Williams Bay, Australia|Williams Bay]]).

They total approximately {{convert|2.5|km2|sqmi|1}} in area, where McDonald Island is {{convert|1.13|km2|sqmi|1}}.

Many of these wetland areas are separated by active glaciers. There are also several short glacier-fed streams and glacial pools. Some wetland areas have been recorded on McDonald Island but, due to substantial volcanic activity since the last landing was made in 1980, their present extent is unknown.\n\nThe HIMI wetland is listed on the [[Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia]] and, in a recent analysis of Commonwealth-managed wetlands, was ranked highest for nomination under the [[Ramsar Convention|Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention)]] as an internationally important wetland.\n\nSix wetland types have been identified from HIMI covering approximately 1860 ha: coastal \u2018pool complex\u2019 (237 ha); inland \u2018pool complex\u2019 (105 ha); vegetated seeps mostly on recent glaciated areas (18 ha); glacial lagoons (1103 ha); non-glacial lagoons (97ha); Elephant Spit (300 ha) plus some coastal areas. On Heard Island, the majority of these types suites are found below 150&nbsp;m asl. The wetland vegetation occurs in the \u2018wet mixed herbfield\u2019 and \u2018coastal biotic vegetation\u2019 communities described above.\n\nThe wetlands provide important breeding and feeding habitat for a number of Antarctic and subantarctic wetland animals. These include the southern elephant seal and macaroni, gentoo, king and southern rockhopper penguins, considered to be wetland species under the Ramsar Convention. Non-wetland vegetated parts of the islands also support penguin and other seabird colonies.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Heard Island Karman vortex street.jpg|thumb|[[Vortex shedding]] as winds pass Heard Island resulted in this [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] in the clouds]]\nThe islands have an Antarctic climate, tempered by their maritime setting. The weather is marked by low seasonal and daily temperature ranges, persistent and generally low cloud cover, frequent precipitation and strong winds. Snowfall occurs throughout the year. Monthly average temperatures at [[Atlas Cove]] (at the northwestern end of Heard Island) range from {{convert|0.0|to|4.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, with an average daily range of {{convert|3.7|to|5.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in summer and {{convert|-0.8|to|0.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in winter.

Gusts in excess of {{convert|180|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} have been recorded. Annual precipitation at sea level on Heard Island is in the order of {{convert|1300|to|1900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}; rain or snow falls on about 3 out of 4 days.<ref>HIMI official website.</ref>\n\nMeteorological records at Heard Island are incomplete.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Heard Island, 12 m asl (1981\u20132010 normals) \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 20.1\n|Feb record high C = 18.0\n|Mar record high C = 19.9\n|Apr record high C = 20.4\n|May record high C = 19.3\n|Jun record high C = 14.0\n|Jul record high C = 15.0\n|Aug record high C = 15.4\n|Sep record high C = 16.8\n|Oct record high C = 16.4\n|Nov record high C = 14.6\n|Dec record high C = 19.2\n|Jan high C = 6.4\n|Feb high C = 6.5\n|Mar high C = 6.3\n|Apr high C = 5.3\n|May high C = 3.7\n|Jun high C = 2.3\n|Jul high C = 2.2\n|Aug high C = 2.2\n|Sep high C = 2.2\n|Oct high C = 3.3\n|Nov high C = 4.1\n|Dec high C = 5.4\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 4.7\n|Feb mean C = 4.8\n|Mar mean C = 4.6\n|Apr mean C = 3.6\n|May mean C = 2.2\n|Jun mean C = 0.9\n|Jul mean C = 0.5\n|Aug mean C = 0.4\n|Sep mean C = 0.5\n|Oct mean C = 1.5\n|Nov mean C = 2.4\n|Dec mean C = 3.8\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 3.0\n|Feb low C = 3.1\n|Mar low C = 2.8\n|Apr low C = 1.9\n|May low C = 0.7\n|Jun low C = -0.6\n|Jul low C = -1.1\n|Aug low C = -1.4\n|Sep low C = -1.1\n|Oct low C = -0.2\n|Nov low C = 0.7\n|Dec low C = 2.1\n|year low C = \n|Jan record low C = -0.5\n|Feb record low C = 0.2\n|Mar record low C = -1.7\n|Apr record low C = -2.9\n|May record low C = -4.8\n|Jun record low C = -7.2\n|Jul record low C = -6.2\n|Aug record low C = -11.5\n|Sep record low C = -8.6\n|Oct record low C = -7.1\n|Nov record low C = -6.2\n|Dec record low C = -0.7\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm = \n|Feb precipitation mm =  \n|Mar precipitation mm = \n|Apr precipitation mm = \n|May precipitation mm =  \n|Jun precipitation mm =  \n|Jul precipitation mm = \n|Aug precipitation mm = \n|Sep precipitation mm = \n|Oct precipitation mm =  \n|Nov precipitation mm = \n|Dec precipitation mm = \n|year precipitation mm = \n|unit precipitation days = 1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  \n|Feb precipitation days =  \n|Mar precipitation days =  \n|Apr precipitation days =  \n|May precipitation days =  \n|Jun precipitation days =  \n|Jul precipitation days =  \n|Aug precipitation days =  \n|Sep precipitation days =  \n|Oct precipitation days =  \n|Nov precipitation days =  \n|Dec precipitation days =  \n|year precipitation days = \n|source 1=  M\u00e9t\u00e9o climat stats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/listenormale-1981-2010-1-p97.php|title=Moyennes 1961-1990 Australie (Ile Heard)|language=fr|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2= M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat <ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/station-31.php|title=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat stats for Ile Heard |publisher=M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat|accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\n=== Flora ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==== Constraints ====\nThe islands are part of the [[Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] that includes several [[subantarctic]] islands. In this cold climate plant life is mainly limited to grasses, lichens, and [[moss]]es.<ref>[http://heardisland.antarctica.gov.au/nature/plants Plants]. Australian Department of the Environment, Australian Antarctic Division. Updated 28 February 2005.</ref> Low plant diversity reflects the islands\u2019 isolation, small size, severe climate, the short, cool growing season and, for Heard Island, substantial permanent ice cover. The main environmental determinants of vegetation on subantarctic islands are wind exposure, water availability, parent soil composition, salt spray exposure, nutrient availability, disturbance by trampling (from seabirds and seals) and, possibly, altitude. At Heard Island, exposure to salt spray and the presence of breeding and moulting seabirds and seals are particularly strong influences on vegetation composition and structure in coastal areas.\n\n==== History ====\nEvidence from microfossil records indicates that ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the [[Tertiary]] (a period with a cool and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered the distribution and abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.\n\n==== Flowering plants and ferns ====\nLow-growing [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] flowering plants and [[bryophyte]]s are the major vegetation components. The vascular flora comprises the smallest number of species of any major subantarctic island group, reflecting its isolation, small ice-free area and severe climate. Twelve vascular species are known from Heard Island, of which five have also been recorded on McDonald Island. None of the vascular species is endemic, although ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Colobanthus kerguelensis]]'', and ''[[Poa kerguelensis]]'' occur only on subantarctic islands in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe plants are typically subantarctic, but with a higher abundance of the cushion-forming ''[[Azorella selago]]'' than other subantarctic islands. Heard Island is the largest subantarctic island with no confirmed human-introduced plants. Areas available for plant colonisation on Heard Island are generally the result of retreating glaciers or new ice-free land created by lava flows. Today, substantial vegetation covers over 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of Heard Island, and is best developed on coastal areas at elevations below 250&nbsp;m.\n\n==== Mosses and liverworts ====\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) contribute substantially to the overall biodiversity of Heard Island, with 43 mosses and 19 liverworts being recorded, often occupying habitats unsuitable for vascular plants, such as cliff faces. Bryophytes are present in most of the major vegetation communities including several soil and moss-inhabiting species. A 1980 survey of McDonald Island found lower diversity than that on Heard Island; four mosses and a number of algal species are recorded from there.\n\n==== Algae ====\nAt least 100 species of terrestrial algae are known from Heard Island, commonly in permanently moist and ephemeral habitats. Forests of the giant Antarctic kelp ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' occur at a number of sites around Heard Island and at least 17 other species of seaweed are known, with more to be added following the identification of recent collections. Low seaweed diversity is due to the island's isolation from other land masses, unsuitable beach habitat, constant abrasion by waves, tides and small stones, and the extension of glaciers into the sea in many areas.\n\n==== Vegetation communities ====\nHeard Island has a range of terrestrial environments in which vegetation occurs. Seven general vegetation communities are currently recognised, although vegetation composition is considered more of a continuum than discrete units:\n* [[Subantarctic]] vegetation is minimal and includes small types of shrubbery, including mosses and liverworts.\n* [[cushion plant|Open cushionfield]] vegetation is the most widespread and abundant vegetation type on Heard Island. It is characterised by ''[[Azorella selago]]'' cushions interspersed with bryophytes, small vascular species and bare ground with 20\u201375% cover, and found mainly at altitudes between 30\u201370m asl.\n* [[Fellfield]] describes vegetation with abundant bare ground and less than 50% plant cover. Fellfield may occur as a result of harsh climatic and/or edaphic factors, or recent [[deglaciation]] which has exposed bare ground.\n* [[Moss]]y [[fellfield]] is a community with high species richness and consists of bryophytes and small ''Azorella selago'' cushions. It is found at altitudes between 30\u2013150&nbsp;m in areas with intermediate exposure.\n* [[Herbfield|Wet mixed herbfield]] occurs on moist substrate, mostly on moraines and moist lee slopes (often in association with burrowing petrels colonies) at low altitude (< 40&nbsp;m) where the water table is at or close to the surface. Species richness is highest here of all the communities, with dominant species being ''[[Poa cookii]]'', ''Azorella selago'', ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'', ''[[Acaena magellanica]]'', and ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]''.\n* [[Coastal Strand|Coastal biotic]] vegetation is dominated by ''Poa cookii'' and ''Azorella selago'', occurring mainly on coastal sites of moderate exposure and in areas subject to significant influence from seals and seabirds.\n* [[Supralittoral zone|Saltspray vegetation]] is dominated by the salt-tolerant moss ''[[Muelleriella crassifolia]]'' and limited in extent, being found at low elevations on lavas in exposed coastal sites.\n* [[cushion plant|Closed cushionfield]] is found on moraines and sand at altitudes mostly below 60&nbsp;m, and is dominated almost entirely by ''Azorella selago'' cushions that often grow together to form continuous carpets which can be subject to burrowing by seabirds.\n\n==== Outlook ====\nOne of the most rapidly changing physical settings in the subantarctic has been produced on Heard Island by a combination of rapid glacial recession and climate warming.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The consequent increase in habitat available for plant colonisation, plus the coalescing of previously discrete ice-free areas, has led to marked changes in the vegetation of Heard Island in the last 20 years or so. Other species and vegetation communities found on subantarctic islands north of the [[Antarctic Convergence]] now absent from the Heard Island flora may colonise the island if climate change produces more favourable conditions.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nSome plant species are spreading and modifying the structure and composition of communities, some of which are also increasing in distribution. It is likely that further changes will occur, and possibly at an accelerated rate. Changes in population numbers of seal and seabird species are also expected to affect the vegetation by changing nutrient availability and disturbance through trampling.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOne plant species on Heard Island, ''[[Poa annua]]'', a cosmopolitan grass native to Europe, was possibly introduced by humans, though is more likely to have arrived naturally, probably by [[skua]]s from the Kerguelen Islands where it is widespread. It was initially recorded in 1987 in two deglaciated areas of Heard Island not previously exposed to human visitors, while being absent from known sites of past human habitation. Since 1987 ''Poa annua'' populations have increased in density and abundance within the original areas and have expanded beyond them. Expeditioner boot traffic during the Australian Antarctic program expedition in 1987 may be at least partly responsible for the spread, but it is probably mainly due to dispersal by wind and the movement of seabirds and seals around the island.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe potential for introducing plant species (including invasive species not previously found on subantarctic islands) by both natural and human-induced means is high. This is due to the combination of low species diversity and climatic amelioration. During the 2003/04 summer a new plant species, ''[[Cotula plumosa]]'', was recorded. Only one small specimen was found growing on a coastal river terrace that had experienced substantial development and expansion of vegetation over the past decade. The species has a circumantarctic distribution and occurs on many subantarctic islands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=P. A. M.|last2=Scott|first2=J. J.|last3=Rozefelds|first3=A.

Both the shag and the sheathbill are endemic to Heard Island.\n\nA further 28 seabird species are recorded as either non-breeding visitors or have been noted during 'at-sea surveys' of the islands. All recorded breeding species, other than the Heard Island sheathbill, are listed marine species under the Australian Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act (1999, four are listed as threatened species and five are listed migratory species. Under the EPBC Act a recovery plan has been made for albatrosses and giant petrels, which calls for ongoing population monitoring of the species found at HIMI, and at the time of preparing this plan a draft recovery plan has also been made for the [[Heard Island shag|Heard Island cormorant (or shag)]] and Antarctic tern.\n\nThe recorded populations of some seabird species found in the Reserve have shown marked change. The king penguin population is the best studied seabird species on Heard Island and has shown a dramatic increase since first recorded in 1947/48, with the population doubling every five years or so for more than 50 years.\n\nA paper reviewing population data for the black-browed albatross between 1947 and 2000/01 suggested that the breeding population had increased to approximately three times that present in the late 1940s,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Woehler |first=E.

The discovery of a large, previously unknown, colony of Heard shags in 2000/01 at Cape Pillar raised the known breeding population from 200 pairs to over 1000 pairs.<ref name=\"Woehler, E.J. 2006\"/> The breeding population of southern giant petrels decreased by more than 50% between the early 1950s and the late 1980s.\n\n==== Terrestrial, freshwater and coastal invertebrates ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\nHeard Island supports a relatively low number of terrestrial invertebrate species compared to other Southern Ocean islands, in parallel with the low species richness in the flora\u2013that is, the island's isolation and limited ice-free area. [[Endemism]] is also generally low and the invertebrate fauna is exceptionally pristine with few, if any, (successful) human-induced introductions of alien species.\nTwo species, including the thrips ''Apterothrips apteris'' and the mite ''[[Tyrophagus putrescentiae]]'' are thought to be recent, possibly natural, introductions. An exotic species of earthworm ''[[Dendrodrilus rubidus]]'' was also collected in 1929 from a dump near Atlas Cove, and has recently been collected from a variety of habitats including wallows, streams and lakes on Heard Island.\n\nThe arthropods of Heard Island are comparatively well known with 54 species of [[mite]] and [[tick]], one [[spider]] and eight [[springtail]]s recorded. A study over summer at Atlas Cove in 1987/88 showed overall densities of up to 60 000 individual springtails per square metre in soil under stands of ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''. Despite a few recent surveys, the non-arthropod invertebrate fauna of Heard Island remain poorly known.\n\nBeetles and flies dominate Heard Island's known insect fauna, which comprises up to 21 species of ectoparasite (associated with birds and seals) and up to 13 free-living species. Approximately half of the free-living insects are habitat-specific, while the remainder are generalists found in a variety of habitats, being associated with either supralittoral or intertidal zones, ''[[Poa cookii]]'' and ''[[Pringlea antiscorbutica]]'' stands, [[bryophyte]]s, lichen-covered rocks, exposed rock faces or the underside of rocks. There is a pronounced seasonality to the insect fauna, with densities in winter months dropping to a small percentage (between 0.75%) of the summer maximum. Distinct differences in relative abundances of species between habitats has also been shown, including a negative relationship between altitude and body size for Heard Island weevils.\n\nThe fauna of the freshwater pools, lakes, streams and mires found in the coastal areas of Heard Island are broadly similar to those on other subantarctic islands of the southern Indian Ocean. Many species reported from Heard Island are found elsewhere. Some sampling of freshwater fauna has been undertaken during recent expeditions and records to date indicate that the freshwater fauna includes a species of [[Protista]], a gastrotrich, two species of [[tardigrade]], at least four species of nematode, 26 species of rotifer, six species of annelid and 14 species of arthropod.\n\nAs with the other shore biota, the marine macro-invertebrate fauna of Heard Island is similar in composition and local distribution to other subantarctic islands, although relatively little is known about the Heard Island communities compared with the well-studied fauna of some other islands in the subantarctic region, such as [[Macquarie Island|Macquarie]] and Kerguelen.\n\nDespite Heard Island's isolation, species richness is considered to be moderate, rather than depauperate, although the number of endemic species reported is low. The large macro-alga ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'' supports a diverse array of invertebrate taxa and may play an important role in transporting some of this fauna to Heard Island.\n\nThe rocky shores of Heard Island exhibit a clear demarcation between fauna of the lower kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet ''Nacella kerguelensis'' is abundant in the lower part of the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton ''[[Hemiarthrum setulosum]]'' and the starfish ''Anasterias mawsoni''. The amphipod ''Hyale'' sp. and the isopod ''Cassidinopsis'' sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid ''Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis'' and the bivalve mollusc ''Kidderia bicolor'' are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve ''Gaimardia trapesina trapesina'' has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:FMIB 46007 Antarctic Sea-Elephant Fishery.jpeg|thumb|right|Heard Island 1887 by [[Henry Wood Elliott]]<ref>Goode, George Brown (1887) Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1887).</ref>]]\nNeither island-cluster had recorded visitors until the mid-1850s.\n\nAn American sailor, John Heard, on the ship ''Oriental'', sighted Heard Island on 25 November 1853, en route from [[Boston]] to Melbourne.

In the sailing period from 1855 to 1880 a number of American sealers spent a year or more on the island, living in appalling conditions in dark smelly huts, also at Oil Barrel Point. At its peak the community consisted of 200 people. By 1880 sealers had wiped out most of the seal population and then left the island. In all the islands furnished more than 100,000 barrels of [[elephant seal|elephant-seal]] oil during this period.\n\nA number of wrecks have occurred in the vicinity of the islands. There is also a discarded building left from John Heard's sealing station which is situated near Atlas Cove.\n\nThe first recorded landing on McDonald Island was made by Australian scientists Grahame Budd and Hugh Thelander on 12 February 1971, using a helicopter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|title=SIOE 2002: Heard I. & The McDonald Is|date=1 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426052000/http://www.cerchi.net/destinations/2002_sioe/sioe_himi.html|archive-date=26 April 2012|last=Cerchi|first=Dan|website=www.cerchi.net}}</ref><ref name=\"aad\">{{cite web|url=http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406140708/http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=2177  |archivedate=2011-04-06 |url-status=dead |title=Gazetteer - AADC Name Details - Australian Antarctic Data Centre |via=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=29 March 2016|website=[[Australian Antarctic Data Centre]]}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have been a territory of Australia since 1947, when they were transferred from the UK.<ref name=\"CIA World Factbook.\"/> The archipelago became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997.\n\nThere were at least five private expeditions to Heard Island between 1965 and 2000.

separate orchestras are recorded as having existed in the city between that date and the foundation of what is now the CBSO in 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} These orchestras often owed their origins to Birmingham's internationally significant tradition of [[choral music]], that give birth to works such as [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius|Dream of Gerontius]]'',{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} and in 1834 saw the building [[Birmingham Town Hall]], one of Europe's earliest large-scale concert

of 25 musicians in 1768 but by 1834 had grown into an orchestra of 147.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} Under [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]] and [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] between 1849 and 1909 it included some of the leading instrumentalists of its day from across Britain and Europe,<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> but remained an ''ad hoc'' grouping that assembled to play only at the three-yearly festivals.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} The town's first permanently established orchestra of locally based professional musicians was [[William Stockley's Orchestra]], which was founded in 1856 and held annual concert seasons between 1873 and 1897.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=167}} This was eclipsed as the city's leading orchestra at the end of the 19th century by [[George

this demand was met by a number of competing enterprises.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} Halford's players reformed in 1906 as the self-governing [[Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]], which continued to perform until 1918 under notable conductors including [[Henry Wood]], [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] and Halford himself.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=216-217}} [[Landon Ronald]] presented an annual season of promenade concerts at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in New Street from 1905 to 1914 with a 70-strong orchestra made up largely of Birmingham-based musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} [[Appleby Matthews]] and [[Richard Wassell]] both ran separate orchestras in their own names presenting annual series of concerts between 1916 and 1920;{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=223}} and [[Thomas Beecham]] conducted and promoted his own [[New Birmingham Orchestra]] between 1917 and 1919.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=222-223}}\n\nFrom 1916 onwards, a group of influential local figures began to pursue the idea of a single, permanent, municipally funded orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=223-224}} in keeping with the [[Civic Gospel]] tradition established in Birmingham under [[Joseph Chamberlain]], that envisaged cities as having responsibility as a body for their citizens' civic, social and cultural welfare.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=253}} Leading members of this campaign included [[Neville Chamberlain]], who was [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham]] from 1916 to 1918; [[Granville Bantock]], composer and Professor of Music at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and [[Ernest Newman]], a leading Birmingham-based music critic, who had written as early as 1913 that the system of financial guarantees from wealthy patrons that had supported Birmingham's orchestras through the 19th century had become discredited.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=16-17}} The group's first plan was to support Beecham's New Birmingham Orchestra, but this enterprise was wound up after the government requisitioned the Town Hall for the issue of First World War ration books, depriving it of its primary concert venue.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=18-19}} A few weeks after the end of the war Bantock revived the idea {{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=21}} and on 17 March 1919 he submitted a proposal to [[Birmingham City Council]] for an orchestra of 70 musicians to be engaged annually from October to May, at an estimated annual cost of \u00a38,500 and with projected annual revenue of \u00a36,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=22-23}} The city council agreed to support the proposal with an annual grant of \u00a31,250 for an experimental period of five years,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}} the first time that public funds had been used to support an orchestra anywhere in Great Britain.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}}\n\n=== Early years under Matthews ===\n[[File:Appleby-Matthews.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Appleby Matthews]]]]\nThe new orchestra's management committee met for the first time on 19 June 1919 and named itself the City of Birmingham Orchestra or CBO, probably to emphasise its civic status,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}} though it also made clear that the CBO would be a self-governing musical body, not a municipal orchestra along the lines of those commonly found in seaside resorts.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} During its early years the orchestra was sometimes referred to as the Birmingham City Orchestra, or commonly just the \"City Orchestra\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Thomas Beecham]] was considered to be the most suitable candidate for the Principal Conductor role, but he was pre-occupied with his own acute financial problems and had not forgiven the city for its failure to support his earlier [[New Birmingham Orchestra]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=20, 23}} As a result, a shortlist of four candidates was drawn up from the numerous applications for the post, though the initial one-year contract came to limit the choice to local applicants.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} The eventual appointee was [[Appleby Matthews]], who had been running his own orchestra in the city since 1916 and had strong support from local music critics on the selection panel.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Richard Wassell]] was appointed as Assistant Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}}\n\n[[File:CBSO first concert -

popular classics established by his own orchestra over the previous five years.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} The orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the

of music performed being [[Granville Bantock]]'s ''Saul''.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} After two months of preparing the orchestra with the popular concerts,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the inaugural concert of the Symphony Concerts series was given at the Town Hall on 10 November 1920, with [[Edward Elgar]] conducting a concert of his own works,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} including [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|his Cello Concerto]] with [[Felix Salmond]] as the soloist. The first season continued with a remarkable series of programmes, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] conducting his own ''[[A London Symphony|London Symphony]]'', [[Hamilton Harty]] conducting [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]\u2019s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', [[Adrian Boult]] conducting [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]\u2019s [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]], [[Landon Ronald]] conducting [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]\u2019 [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Symphony]] and [[Jean Sibelius]] conducting his own [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Morley|title=A glorious 90 years for CBSO|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/music/glorious-90-years-cbso-3925711|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> Two features that would become longstanding traditions for the orchestra were also established during this first year: performances of then-recent works by Holst, Vaughan Williams and Bax saw a strong representation of new music in the orchestra's programmes; and from February 1921 the orchestra's commitment to musical education was underlined with a series of concerts for city schoolchildren held in the Town Hall on Saturday afternoons.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}}\n\nMatthews had originally been appointed to be conductor with a fee of \u00a3450 for 30 concerts, but had persuaded the committee to give him instead the combined role of conductor, secretary and manager for a fee of \u00a31,000 per year.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} He had only limited experience in any of these roles, however,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=26}} and developed a difficult relationship with the politicians and businessmen who made up the CBO committee.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}} His plan to supplement the playing strength of the orchestra with members of the [[Birmingham City Police]] band almost caused the orchestra to strike before it had even played a concert,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=27}} and resulted in questions being asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in December 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} Matthews' conducting and his management were both poorly reviewed by Birmingham-based critics, though reviews from outside the city were more positive, with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' being highly complimentary and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' concluding \"Manchester may well envy Birmingham its municipal music\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=29-30}} Matthews' Symphony Series programmes were highly ambitious and enterprising,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} and he was able to claim that \"the amount subscribed for Symphony Concerts constituted a record for any similar series of concerts in this city\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} but the Sunday concerts were loss-making, with the expensive seats often unsold.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} In 1922 Matthews was relieved of any involvement in the financial administration of the orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=250}} popular concerts were increasingly moved to suburban and out-of-town venues, and development and marketing plans were drawn up to stem a deficit which by May 1923 grown to \u00a33,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}} In July the orchestra and Matthews both engaged solicitors and in October Matthews was informed his contract was to be terminated,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}}  His final CBO concert was on 30 March 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=32}} and the relationship dissolved in acrimonious and expensive litigation.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}}\n\n=== Boult and the first \"golden period\" ===\n[[File:Sir Adrian Boult by Ishibashi Kazunori (Royal College of Music).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Adrian Boult]] in 1923 by [[Ishibashi Kazunori]]]]\nThe CBO committee had two candidates in mind to replace Matthews: [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] and [[Adrian Boult]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=33}} For a while the committee explored the possibility of appointing both as joint conductors, but were convinced by [[Ernest de S\u00e9lincourt]] that this idea was unworkable.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=97}} Boult had recently replaced [[Henry Wood]] as the conductor of the [[Birmingham Festival Choral Society]]{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=112}} &ndash; possibly calculating that there might shortly be a vacancy with the City Orchestra{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} &ndash; and in March 1924 he was announced in the press as the CBO's new Director and Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=36}} At the age of 35 he already had a substantial international musical reputation, having studied at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] under [[Arthur Nikisch]], conducted the world premier of [[Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'' at the age of 25, and worked for a period as chief conductor of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=251}} The urbane, Oxford-educated Boult was also comfortable dealing with influential local citizens, ensuring the orchestra retained the financial support it needed to continue.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} His tenure at the CBO would mark the start of a \"golden period\" for the orchestra{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=52}} that would see it rise to national prominence,{{sfn|Jenkins|King-Smith|1983|p=1}} outshining the struggling London orchestras{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=9}} and establishing Boult himself as a major figure of British musical life.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=34-35}}\n\nBoult brought a wider vision for the orchestra's future,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} building on Matthews' foundations but expanding beyond them.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} Some of the leading conductors in Europe were brought in to guest conduct, including [[Bruno Walter]], [[Pierre Monteux]], [[Ernest Ansermet]] and [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} Boult introduced lunchtime concerts at the Town Hall,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} inaugurated lectures about forthcoming music on the Thursdays before symphony concerts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} invited students from the [[University of Birmingham]] to attend open rehearsals,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} and introduced free concerts for children during school hours.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=129}} The orchestra made its first commercial recording in 1925.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=39-40}} A more unusual experiment took place later the same year, when [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]] was performed at the Town Hall with [[Harold Bauer]] as soloist, but with his part played not with him present but as a pre-recorded [[piano roll]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} A particular concern of Boult's was to reduce the effect of the summer break when, as with London's [[Queen's Hall|Queen's Hall Orchestra]] and Manchester's [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the CBO's musicians spent the summer working at seaside resorts and often picked up bad habits freelancing for pier orchestras.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=252-253}} The committee felt unable at that time to meet Boult's desire to offer players permanent year-round contracts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=45}} but Boult tried to lessen the length of the break by initiating performances at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s throughout the Midlands.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and building up the orchestra's diary of out-of-town concerts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}}\n\nThe immediate impact of Boult's arrival was conveyed by the ''Birmingham Post'' reviewing his first season: \"The strongest impression is of a very great gain in note accuracy, a much improved ensemble, and a high standard of playing from the string group. The advance made within a single season is so considerable as to be remarkable.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=104}} The orchestra also moved into more adventurous repertoire,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} for example performing [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' less than a year after its composition, while the composer was little-known in England.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}} The CBO's performance of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] in 1926 was only the third performance of any Mahler symphony given in Britain,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=112}} and that of ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' was only the second time it had been performed in England.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Both were followed shortly afterwards by performances by orchestras in London and marked the start of the gradual increase in interest in Mahler's work in Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=133}}\n\nBy 1926 the orchestra's finances had improved,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=113}} helped by the City Council's decision in 1924 to allow [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to be used rent-free for the Symphony concerts{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1925 to double the CBO's grant to \u00a32,500 annually.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} Less positive was the collapse in October 1925 of the Town Hall's ceiling, leading the orchestra to move its concerts temporarily to [[Methodist Central Hall, Birmingham|Central Hall]] on [[Corporation Street, Birmingham|Corporation Street]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} Expenditure on repairing the Town Hall put back prospects of the new concert hall that Boult had been promised,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=42}} and the reconfiguration of the hall from one gallery to two &ndash; engineered by London-based architect [[Charles Allom]] without consulting any local musicians &ndash; created acoustic problems that would dog the orchestra until its move to [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]] six decades later: the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' wrote that \"everything sounded strange\" and complained of acoustic dead spots in the ground floor and lower gallery.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=43, 45}}\n\nOne aspect of Boult's time at the CBO was the development of an important relationship with the recently established [[BBC]]. The CBO's concert at Birmingham Town Hall on 7 October 1924 was the first orchestral concert anywhere in the world to be transmitted as an [[outside broadcast]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1924 and early 1925 the CBO was used to perform four \"International Symphony Concerts\" at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in London,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} supplementing the BBC's own \"Wireless Players\" to form the \"Wireless Symphony Orchestra\", the forerunner of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=10}} In 1927 the relationship became more problematic as the BBC stopped broadcasting CBO concerts as a result of national dispute with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians Union]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=42, 45}} and in 1928 upgraded the orchestra at its Birmingham station, luring sixteen of the CBO's most important players away with full-time contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=46}} In May 1929 the BBC went a stage further, when the retirement of its Music Director [[Percy Pitt]] saw Boult offered the role as his replacement.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Boult was happy in Birmingham and had planned to stay at least another ten years,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} but was encouraged to accept the BBC role by [[Henry Wood]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} He resisted [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]]'s pressure to take up the BBC post immediately and agreed instead to perform a further final season with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=47-48}} He later said he regretted leaving Birmingham,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=254}} which provided the only time in his career he was able to fully control his own programmes.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=100}}\n\n===Consolidation under Heward===\n[[File:Leslie Heward Cape Town Postcard crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leslie Heward]]]]\nFour conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts &ndash; [[Leslie Heward]], [[Stanley Chapple]], [[Julius Harrison]] and [[Basil Cameron]] &ndash; but Boult later described how \"Heward very easily won the palm\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=48}} Heward had studied conducting under Boult at the [[Royal College of Music]], where [[Hubert Parry]] had described him as \"the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as Music Director of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and Conductor of the [[Cape Town Orchestra]], where he had raised the standards of the orchestra's playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} Despite this, his appointment was a gamble for the CBO committee, as he was still largely unknown to English audiences.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}}\n\nHeward soon gained the respect of the orchestra's players and the Birmingham audience for his formidable musicianship.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} His score-reading ability was exceptional and he was able to instantly diagnose problems in rehearsal - the CBO's flautist remarked that he had \"never known a conductor who was so much respected by his players.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} He was also known for his honesty and integrity, sometimes restarting a public performance he felt to be substandard halfway through, saying \"I'm sorry, we can do better than that.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}}  His programming in Birmingham was bold: 28 of the 41 pieces played in his first season were Birmingham premieres,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} and the orchestra became particularly known for its interpretations of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvorak]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and modern British composers.<ref>{{cite

front-rank soloists: [[Arthur De Greef (composer)|Arthur de Greef]] and [[Nikolai Orlov (pianist)|Nikolai Orlov]] performed in 1931;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} [[Artur Schnabel]] played [[Ludwig van

[[Frederic Lamond (pianist)|Frederic Lamond]] performed in 1934;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=61}} [[Adolf Busch]] and [[Solomon (pianist)|Solomon]] in 1936;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=62-63}} and in 1938 [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] played one of his own Piano Concertos.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=64}}\n\nAssistant Conductor [[Joseph Lewis (conductor)|Joseph Lewis]] followed Boult to the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in 1931.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} His eventual replacement, [[Harold Gray (conductor)|Harold Gray]], had started his 55-year-long association with the orchestra as Boult's secretary and musical amanuensis in 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=37}} and had first conducted the orchestra in 1930 in [[Sutton Coldfield]] where he was organist at parish church.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=50}} Heward was reluctant to talk to audiences and didn't enjoy performing for schoolchildren{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}} so Gray took over children's concerts in 1931{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}} and was appointed Deputy Conductor in 1932.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}}\n\nThe Symphony concerts under Heward drew excellent attendances, but audiences continued to drop for concerts of popular classics as competition from radio and the cinema for leisure time activity increased.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=59, 61}} Relief from the resulting financial pressure came through a series of arrangements with the BBC.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} In 1930 the broadcaster agreed to reduce its Birmingham orchestra to an octet &ndash; with the redundant musicians being auditioned by the CBO &ndash; in return for the CBO performing 13 studio concerts each season: an important step towards permanent year-round contracts for the CBO's players.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} In 1934 [[Percy Edgar]] and [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]] agreed to establish the [[BBC Midland Orchestra]] playing 2-3 concerts a week, with Heward as conductor and 35 of its musicians shared with the CBO on 12-month contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} The stability this brought meant that Heward could build on the achievements of the previous 15 years{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} and by the late 1930s the CBO was playing to a standard comparable to the orchestras of major cities of continental Europe.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}}\n\nBy 1939, the CBO's finances were looking sound and its future bright.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=66}} The outbreak of [[World War II]], however, saw the BBC disband its Midland Orchestra and lay off its musicians, many of whom were also leading players with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} [[Birmingham Town Hall]] was commandeered for the war effort and the CBO cancelled all of its engagements, giving Heward six months notice of termination.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=67-68}} Although the orchestra started performing again at the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]] in October as the \"City of Birmingham (Emergency) Orchestra\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=68}} and was able to reinstate Heward on a series of temporary contracts,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}}it had lost many of its prewar players,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=71}} and would be composed only of part-time musicians for much of the war.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=74-75}} Compounding the difficulties was Heward's illness.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He had contracted [[tuberculosis]] during his period in South Africa{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} and was already missing concerts with illness by 1934.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=60-61}} Aggravated by overwork, smoking and heavy drinking, his condition deteriorated and he spent six months in a sanatorium from September 1939 to May 1940.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He gave his first performance for over a year on 20 October 1940, but regularly had to cancel engagements after that,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=70}} with most of the CBO's concerts during the period being conducted by [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}} On Boxing Day 1942 Heward was offered the post of Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]] in [[Manchester]], tendering his resignation with effect from the end of the season, but he did not live to see out his contract, dying at his [[Edgbaston]] home in May 1943.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=75-76}}\n\n=== Post-war doldrums ===\nBy 1944, the wartime orchestra numbered only 62 musicians, all of whom were part-time and most of whom were employees of local munitions factories.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} Weekly concerts took place after only a single rehearsal and different players often performed from concert to concert.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} In an attempt to provide some stability the committee introduced permanent year-round contracts for musicians from May 1944,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=259}} funded by the city council's education committee in return for 50 days of educational work from the orchestra per year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=81}} [[Boyd Neel]] was initially favoured to replace Heward as Principal Conductor after 12 different applicants were given trial concerts over the summer of 1943,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=78-79}} but the orchestra eventually announced the appointment on a one-year contract of [[George Weldon]], the conductor of the [[City of Birmingham Choir]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=258-259}} Weldon was flamboyant and charismatic with a love of fast cars and he cut a glamorous figure on the podium.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=258}} Initial critical and public reaction was very positive and in June 1944 he was confirmed as Music Director.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=81-82}} He broadened the orchestra's reach by introducing modestly-priced summer seasons of promenade concerts from 1945,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=84}} and from 1950 introduced industrial concerts aimed at the city's manufacturing workforce, alongside annual seasons in [[Wolverhampton]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=98}} In January 1948 the orchestra was officially renamed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at Weldon's personal request.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=93}}\n\nWeldon's success in rebuilding the orchestra after the ravages of war was limited, however: he recruited over 40 new musicians during his tenure but by 1951 had only succeeded in increasing the playing strength to 73.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} Year-round contracts demanded a heavy workload \u2013 during the 1945\u201346 season the orchestra played 260 concerts as well as undertaking educational work in the city's schools \u2013 meaning that most concerts were rehearsed only on the day of a performance.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=88}} Audiences were also unpredictable, and Weldon was criticised for programming too much lightweight repertoire.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=260}} The era saw some performances of new compositions including major works composed by the orchestra's oboist [[Ruth Gipps]], and September 1946 brought [[Samuel Barber]] to Birmingham to conduct his own [[Symphony in One Movement (Barber)|First Symphony]], but Weldon repeated popular works multiple times, often twice or more within the same season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=89}} In 1946 [[Eric Blom]] criticised the orchestra for over-performance of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]' ''Fantasia on \"[[Greensleeves]]'''', with the orchestra responding by performing the work in a further concert, backwards.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=87}} The music critic of the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' was sacked in 1945 for writing that other music journalists in the city were covering up the orchestra's low standards,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=260-261}} but by 1948 critics were writing openly of the orchestra's decline.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} An anti-Weldon lobby formed among Birmingham's musical establishment{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} and unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was conducting an affair with Gipps.<ref>{{Citation|last=Halstead|first=Jill|year=2006|title=Ruth Gipps:

would later head the CBSO's council of management and started attending CBSO concerts in 1951, later recalled of the period: \"a pretty awful sound they made, it was a poor orchestra.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=109}}\n\nWith attendance at CBSO concerts averaging only 60% of capacity, the ''Birmingham Post'' ran a series of articles in 1949 arguing for a new approach.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=97}} By the next year, the orchestra had a deficit of \u00a35,000.  In 1951, the incoming executive chairman of the CBSO committee approached [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]] to take over as the orchestra's new chief conductor, letting Weldon know that his contract would not be renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=264}} [[John Barbirolli]] was furious at Weldon's treatment and immediately appointed him Associate Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} but the committee considered the move a \"change to a conductor of a higher calibre\" and Weldon's replacement was viewed by the CBSO's players as a forward looking one.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=102}} Schwarz had a well-established career as an operatic conductor in pre-war Germany, but his role as Music Director of the Jewish Cultural Organisation in Berlin led to him being interned by the Nazis in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Belsen]], from where he was rescued in 1945.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=103-104}} He was highly respected among musicians and had rebuilt the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]] after World War II.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=114}} Adrian Boult wrote to him commending Birmingham as having \"the nicest people\" and assuring him he would enjoy the city, with Schwarz later concluding \"He was absolutely right! I found that Birmingham was ''alive'' - a city with people who work.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=104}}\n\nFrom the start, Schwarz's programming was radically different to Weldon's, reflecting a Central European repertoire alongside many unfamiliar British works.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=104-105}} He reserved an entire day per week for rehearsals, which, despite resistance from conservative orchestral players, quickly began to bear fruit,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=105}} and the orchestra began to attract front-rank soloists again.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=107}} However, fewer concerts, more rehearsal time and falling attendance led to a worsening financial crisis with a deficit of \u00a320,000 in 1952, and for a period it was suggested the CBSO should merge with the Bournemouth orchestra, performing in Birmingham during the winter and Bournemouth in the summer. When this proposal collapsed, the committee planned instead to reduce the orchestra to a six-month operation, until the incoming Labour council agreed to write off the accumulated deficit in May 1952 with an interest-free loan.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=106}} At this time the CBSO was by far the smallest of Britain's regional orchestras,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=108}} but an increase in private donations allowed it to expand the playing staff in 1953,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=110}} and an administrative reorganisation and further increase in support from the city council began to place it on a firmer financial footing.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=109}} The orchestra made its first television appearance in 1954{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=114}} and in 1955 visited the Netherlands on its first overseas tour.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=115}} Most significant were the performances in 1955 and 1956 of the first of a series of new works commissioned for the orchestra by the [[John Feeney Charitable Trust]] \u2013 [[Arthur Bliss]]'s ''[[Meditations on a Theme by John Blow]]'' and [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Tippett)|Piano Concerto]] \u2013 though reviews of the nationally broadcast premiere of the second still brought criticism from the ''[[Musical Times]]'' for the orchestra's \"shaky playing\".{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=265-266}} Schwarz himself later recalled of his period in charge of the CBSO: \"the orchestra did gradually improve, but some of the playing was still not ideal\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=113}}\n\n=== Panufnik and the return of Boult ===\n[[File:Andrzej Panufnik Polish composer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrzej Panufnik]]]]\nIn September 1956 Schwarz announced that he would be leaving the CBSO for the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] at the end of the following season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=118}} Press speculation about a successor centred on [[Hugo Rignold]], but it was [[George Hurst (conductor)|George Hurst]] and [[Andrzej Panufnik]] who were given trial concerts the following December, and Panufnik who was subsequently appointed after a performance described in the CBSO's official history as \"sensationally successful\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Panufnik was best known as a composer, but had built a career as a conductor with the [[Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic Orchestra]]  and [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his native [[Poland]] before [[Defection|defecting]] to England in 1954.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=268}} His first season in Birmingham was highly adventurous, featuring the British premieres of works by [[Ernest Bloch]], [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] and [[Ferenc Farkas]]. Many early English works for small chamber ensembles were included alongside later classical and romantic repertoire, and some concerts would start with only 13 players on the platform.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=123}}\n\nPanufnik's arrival in Birmingham coincided with conflict between the orchestra and management after 16 violinists were asked to re-audition for their places, and a strike was only averted by a management climb down.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Although he later claimed that he \"found the orchestra of a high standard\", Panufnik's experience of working with some of Europe's leading orchestras left him dissatisfied with the CBSO's string sound.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} He had the support of the orchestra's younger players,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=139}} but his attempts to improve the string section brought him into conflict with the [[Concertmaster|orchestra leader]] Norris Stanley, who had played with the orchestra since its foundation in 1920 and rejected Panufnik's authority, resisting all attempts at change.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} Stanley was persuaded to resign in 1958 and was followed by many of the orchestra's old guard, and as a result Panufnik's second season featured less personal conflict.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=125-126}} At the insistence of the orchestra's management it also included four of his own compositions.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=154}} In 1959, however, Panufnik decided not to renew his contract, intending to concentrate instead on composition, explaining \"I have learnt one thing. It is impossible to conduct a permanent orchestra and compose at the same time.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=127}} He continued to have good relations with the orchestra and premiered his [[Piano Concerto]] with the CBSO in 1962.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=158}}\n\nPanufnik's unexpectedly early departure created problems for the CBSO's management, who had intended for him ultimately to be succeeded by [[Meredith Davies]], who had been appointed in 1957 from over 150 applicants as the orchestra's second Associate Conductor alongside [[Harold Gray (conductor)|Harold Gray]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=269}} Although Davies was offered the Principal Conductor role and was considered to have the confidence of the players, he felt he was still unprepared for the position and suggested that \"an eminent conductor\" be appointed for the 1959\u20131960 season with the intention that Davies would take over the following year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Davies was therefore appointed as Deputy Music Director, and [[Adrian Boult]] returned for one year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=141}} Boult had given up the role of  principal conductor of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] two years previously and was still much in demand as a guest conductor, but agreed to return to Birmingham in a move described by [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] as \"combining nostalgia and a generous rescue act\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Boult's season saw him conduct the premiere of [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]'s Violin Concerto with its dedicatee [[Ernest Element]], and a performance of [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Brahm's 4th symphony]] described by [[Robert Matthew-Walker]] as \"the greatest performance of Brahms' fourth symphony I have ever heard.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=129}} John Waterhouse of the ''Birmingham Post'' wrote that under Boult the CBSO again \"sounded as good as any orchestra in the country\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=130}}\n\n=== Rebuilding under Rignold ===\nIn early 1960 the CBSO committee were still planning for Boult's deputy [[Meredith Davies]] to succeed him as Principal Conductor, but Davies had formed an increasingly close working relationship with [[Benjamin Britten]] after taking over conducting duties at a CBSO concert of Britten's works, and in March 1960 he left the orchestra to work with Britten's [[English Opera Group]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=129-130}} Two months later [[Hugo Rignold]] was announced as the CBSO's new Principal Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} Rignold had established his reputation as one of the country's leading conductors during six years at the [[Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], subsequently serving as Music Director of the [[Royal Ballet]] and guest conducting with major orchestras across Britain, Europe and America.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=131-132}} He had conducted the CBSO numerous times since 1955{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} and was noted for his professionalism and technical expertise.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=132}} He had particular strengths as an orchestra trainer and under him consistent signs of the orchestra's potential began to emerge for the first time since the war.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> \n\nRelations between the orchestra's management and players at the time was poor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=132-133}} The summer of 1962 saw the musicians unanimously hand in their notice in a wage dispute,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}} and in 1965 the orchestra suffered the only strike in its history after the demotion of [[Musician's Union]] steward Wilfred Pook from the first to the second violins - an affair reported in the press as \"Pook's pique\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} Rignold however was seen as bringing stability after the turbulence of the Panufnik era and Boult's stopgap year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The last players remaining from the orchestra's first season in 1920 had retired by 1967,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=158}} and Rignold proved an astute judge of musicians, introducing many excellent young players to the orchestra and improving professionalism and discipline.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=137, 151}} He demanded high standards and audiences experienced noticeable improvements.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} By 1963 the orchestra was seeing much improved reviews in the London press.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} The growing prestige of the CBSO made it easier to attract international artists: soloists at CBSO concerts included [[Wilhelm Kempff]], [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Ida Haendel]], [[Paul Tortelier]], [[Isaac Stern]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]];{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=149, 152}} and notable guest conductors included [[Antal Dorati]], [[Jascha Horenstein]], [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Ferdinand Leitner]] and [[Nadia Boulanger]], who conducted a programme of works by her sister [[Lili Boulanger]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}}{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=153}}\n\nRignold updated the orchestra's repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} The era saw Birmingham's first complete performances of works including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'', [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9]]'', [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' and [[William Walton|Walton]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Walton)|Violin Concerto]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} and a series themed around \"Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century\" was held in 1966 and 1967.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=148}} Like [[Leslie Heward]] and [[Rudolf Schwarz]] before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO's entire history,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} saw the orchestra play the first performance of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'' at the dedication of [[Coventry Cathedral]] in 1962, accompanied by [[Peter Pears]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Heather Harper]] and the [[Melos Ensemble]], conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}}  This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the work as \"a masterpiece of the first order\", Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that \"all around her people were in tears\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}}\n\nThe Rignold era also saw modernisation of the CBSO's operations.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The orchestra undertook two major European tours in 1963 and 1968, and in 1966 made its first commercial recordings since 1948,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} producing its first [[LP record|long playing record]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} 1963 saw the orchestra solvent and free of debt for the first time in over a decade,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=136}} leading to an increase in permanent strength to 88.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} The workload of the orchestra remained extremely high though: throughout the 1960s it gave annual concert series in [[Coventry]], [[Nottingham]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Dudley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[London]] as well as regular performances in [[Leeds]] and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} It performed two seasons every year supporting [[Welsh National Opera]], which had no orchestra of its own,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=141}} it accompanied choral societies throught the Midlands,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} and continued to provide 50 days of education work each year in Birmingham schools.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=133}} Despite playing more concerts than the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool]], [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] or [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth]] orchestras it received a smaller grant from the [[Arts Council]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} until increases in 1966 finally brought the it into line.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=146}}\n\n=== Fr\u00e9maux and \"the best French orchestra in the World\"===\n[[File:Louis Fr\u00e9maux (1975).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]]]]\nDespite the progress under [[Hugo Rignold]], by the late 1960s the CBSO committee were beginning to look for a new conductor who could take the orchestra further,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=150-151}} and in 1967 Rignold resigned after being offered a one-year contract extension instead of having his existing three-year deal renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=275}} This left the orchestra without a principal conductor for the 1968-1969 season, but also left it free to give trials to potential replacements.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=152}} [[Norman Del Mar]] and [[Walter Susskind]] both gave successful concerts, but the strong favourite throughout the process was the conductor of the first concert, the Frenchman [[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]], whose appointment was announced from autumn 1969.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=152-153}} Fr\u00e9maux had made his reputation with the [[Monte Carlo Orchestra]], particularly for his recordings of French music, releasing over 30 recordings and winning 8 [[Grand Prix du Disque]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=154}} For the first three years of his appointment in Birmingham he combined his role with continuing as the founding conductor of the [[Orchestre National de Lyon|Orchestre Philharmonique Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] in [[Lyon]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} but in 1972 he resigned from Lyon to concentrate on his Birmingham activities, performing 70 concerts a season with the CBSO even though only contracted to provide 30.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=167}}\n\nFr\u00e9maux oversaw a vast improvement in the CBSO's orchestral standards,{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} drawing from the orchestra a previously unheard-of precision and verve.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} Regular sectional rehearsals were brought in from 1970{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} and Fr\u00e9maux brought a new emphasis on the recruitment of young principals, setting up a complex system of auditions and trial periods{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=159-160}} and attending over 900 auditions himself.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} His opening concert drew \"ecstatic\" reviews from London critics,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} and by 1970 ''The Guardian'' could write that \"there is no better British orchestra outside London\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} By 1972 the same newspaper was going further, writing that \"under Fremaux they combine a purity of intonation which metropolitan orchestras might envy, with a fluid and spontaneous style of phrasing\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} The commercial success of Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO recordings for EMI firmly established its reputation for French music, with recordings of [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Organ Symphony]]'' and [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Grande Messe des morts]]'' being particularly successful.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=169}} Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO also had a high reputation in romantic repertoire by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] as well as twentieth century work such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[William Walton|Walton]] and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]].{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} The distinctive sound that characterised the orchestra under Fr\u00e9maux was considered less well-suited to classic Viennese repertoire such as [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}}\n\nThe popularity of Fr\u00e9maux's concerts saw attendances at [[Birmingham Town Hall]] increase from an average of 67% in 1968-69 to 88% in 1970-71,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} with 45% of the audience aged under 25.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=158}} In response, plans were drawn up by the architect [[John Madin]] in 1970 for a new concert hall to be builton the site of [[Bingley Hall]] just off [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]], and when this scheme was halted by a financial crisis at the city council it was replaced by a proposal from local television station [[Associated Television|ATV]] for a multi-purpose exhibition and concert hall as part of its new studio centre.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=158-159}} This was turned down by the city council for being impractical,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=159}} and instead in 1972 the Town Hall was extensively refurbished with double glazing and more room on the platform, but little improvement in acoustics - the orchestra's manager Arthur Baker commented that \"we still have the same woolly sound\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=163}} More positive developments included the orchestra's first commercial sponsorship{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}} and the foundation in 1973 of the [[CBSO Chorus]], established under [[Gordon Clinton]] to give the orchestra complete artistic control over its choral backing for its burgeoning recording activities..{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}}\n\nFor all its triumphs Fr\u00e9maux's tenure in Birmingham was to end in chaos and acrimony. In 1969 Birmingham City Council had cancelled the CBSO's regular programme of visits to local schools for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}} In their place manager Arthur Baker developed a partnership with promoter [[Victor Hochhauser]] for the orchestra to perform lucrative series of mass-market concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, but constant travelling away from Birmingham and repetitive popular repertoire began to have a negative effect on player morale.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=170}} The CBSO in the 1960s and 1970s had a particular reputation for political activism{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=178}} and Fr\u00e9maux became increasingly uneasy with the amount of internal unrest.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} Matters were made worse when Fr\u00e9maux appointed Baker as his personal agent alongside his role as orchestral manager: the players began to feel that Baker was prioritising Fr\u00e9maux's interests over the orchestra's artistic development{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=179}} and started compiling a dossier of supporting evidence.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=171}} A humiliating climbdown in a dispute with the players over the seating of a freelance viola player in February 1978 led Fr\u00e9maux to decide that he would not renew his contract, later complaining that \"The union wanted to manage the orchestra. Some of them wanted a revolution.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}} The next month, however, a vote of no confidence from the players in Baker led to his resignation, with Fr\u00e9maux himself also resigning out of personal loyalty.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} The players stressed that Fr\u00e9maux retained their support,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} but he never conducted the orchestra again{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}}\n\nAlthough the loss of the orchestra's Manager and  Music Director in a single week was a crisis in the short term, it resulted in a series of longer term changes that would have more positive effects.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} The Swiss avant-garde composer and conductor [[Erich Schmid]] was found at short notice to take over Fremaux's immediate conducting commitments, including a Beethoven festival due to take place less than two months later, and the resulting artistic triumph saw him appointed as the orchestra's first Principal Guest Conductor in September 1979.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=174-175}} The structure of the orchestra's management committees was reformed, with two elected players' representatives on the main decision-making body to improve communications between musicians and management.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Baker's role as General Manager was taken by Ed Smith, who came from the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], where he had worked closely for many years with the conductor of the youth orchestra, [[Simon Rattle]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Rattle had performed four well-received concerts with the CBSO over the previous year and had made no secret of his interest in the Birmingham position.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=184-185}} Smith later commented that \"Simon was still an unknown quantity to most people, but not, of course, to me. I pushed very hard to have him appointed\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} For the first time the appointment of a Principal Conductor required a poll of the musicians as well as the agreement of the committee of management, but on 2 July 1979 Rattle was announced as the orchestra's \"Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} The ''Birmingham Post'' wrote of Fr\u00e9maux that \"whatever the circumstances of his going, he was the man who raised the CBSO to the highest point of prestige in its history to date\",{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} while Rattle joked that he had inherited \"possibly the best French orchestra in the world.\"{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}}\n\n===Rattle and after===\n[[File:Symphony-Hall-Birmingham-from-Upper Circle.jpg|thumb|[[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]], the orchestra's home since 1991]]\nThe CBSO began to gain greater international renown after [[Simon Rattle]] became chief conductor in 1980. Under him, the orchestra increased its recording profile and became one of the leading ensembles in Europe, and gained a name for its interpretations of late [[romantic music|romantic]] and 20th century works, especially those of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and [[Gustav Mahler]]. During this period, the orchestra moved from [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to a new home venue, [[Symphony Hall (Birmingham)|Symphony Hall]], inside Birmingham's [[International Convention Centre, Birmingham|International Convention Centre]]. The nearby [[CBSO Centre]], a converted factory, houses management offices, rehearsal facilities, and is a concert venue in its own right, for more intimate performances.

separate orchestras are recorded as having existed in the city between that date and the foundation of what is now the CBSO in 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} These orchestras often owed their origins to Birmingham's internationally significant tradition of [[choral music]], that give birth to works such as [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius|Dream of Gerontius]]'',{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} and in 1834 saw the building [[Birmingham Town Hall]], one of Europe's earliest large-scale concert

of 25 musicians in 1768 but by 1834 had grown into an orchestra of 147.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=111}} Under [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]] and [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] between 1849 and 1909 it included some of the leading instrumentalists of its day from across Britain and Europe,<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> but remained an ''ad hoc'' grouping that assembled to play only at the three-yearly festivals.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=9}} The town's first permanently established orchestra of locally based professional musicians was [[William Stockley's Orchestra]], which was founded in 1856 and held annual concert seasons between 1873 and 1897.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=167}} This was eclipsed as the city's leading orchestra at the end of the 19th century by [[George Halford's Orchestra]], which put on similar series of concerts between 1897 and 1909.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" />\n\n[[File:Granville Bantock 1868 - 1946.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Granville Bantock]], whose 1919 proposal led to the foundation of the City of Birmingham Orchestra in 1920.]]\nStockley and Halford established regular orchestral concerts as an expected feature of life in Birmingham{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=214}} which by the late 19th century supported a substantial pool of high quality locally based professional musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=216}} Between 1905 and 1920 this demand was met by a number of competing enterprises.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} Halford's players reformed in 1906 as the self-governing [[Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]], which continued to perform until 1918 under notable conductors including [[Henry Wood]], [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] and Halford himself.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=216-217}} [[Landon Ronald]] presented an annual season of promenade concerts at the [[Theatre Royal, Birmingham|Theatre Royal]] in New Street from 1905 to 1914 with a 70-strong orchestra made up largely of Birmingham-based musicians.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=215}} [[Appleby Matthews]] and [[Richard Wassell]] both ran separate orchestras in their own names presenting annual series of concerts between 1916 and 1920;{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=223}} and [[Thomas Beecham]] conducted and promoted his own [[New Birmingham Orchestra]] between 1917 and 1919.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=222-223}}\n\nFrom 1916 onwards, a group of influential local figures began to pursue the idea of a single, permanent, municipally funded orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=223-224}} in keeping with the [[Civic Gospel]] tradition established in Birmingham under [[Joseph Chamberlain]], that envisaged cities as having responsibility as a body for their citizens' civic, social and cultural welfare.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=253}} Leading members of this campaign included [[Neville Chamberlain]], who was [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham]] from 1916 to 1918; [[Granville Bantock]], composer and Professor of Music at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and [[Ernest Newman]], a leading Birmingham-based music critic, who had written as early as 1913 that the system of financial guarantees from wealthy patrons that had supported Birmingham's orchestras through the 19th century had become discredited.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=16-17}} The group's first plan was to support Beecham's New Birmingham Orchestra, but this enterprise was wound up after the government requisitioned the Town Hall for the issue of First World War ration books, depriving it of its primary concert venue.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=18-19}} A few weeks after the end of the war Bantock revived the idea {{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=21}} and on 17 March 1919 he submitted a proposal to [[Birmingham City Council]] for an orchestra of 70 musicians to be engaged annually from October to May, at an estimated annual cost of \u00a38,500 and with projected annual revenue of \u00a36,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=22-23}} The city council agreed to support the proposal with an annual grant of \u00a31,250 for an experimental period of five years,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}} the first time that public funds had been used to support an orchestra anywhere in Great Britain.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}}\n\n=== Early years under Matthews ===\n[[File:Appleby-Matthews.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Appleby Matthews]]]]\nThe new orchestra's management committee met for the first time on 19 June 1919 and named itself the City of Birmingham Orchestra or CBO, probably to emphasise its civic status,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=23}} though it also made clear that the CBO would be a self-governing musical body, not a municipal orchestra along the lines of those commonly found in seaside resorts.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} During its early years the orchestra was sometimes referred to as the Birmingham City Orchestra, or commonly just the \"City Orchestra\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Thomas Beecham]] was considered to be the most suitable candidate for the Principal Conductor role, but he was pre-occupied with his own acute financial problems and had not forgiven the city for its failure to support his earlier [[New Birmingham Orchestra]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=20, 23}} As a result, a shortlist of four candidates was drawn up from the numerous applications for the post, though the initial one-year contract came to limit the choice to local applicants.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} The eventual appointee was [[Appleby Matthews]], who had been running his own orchestra in the city since 1916 and had strong support from local music critics on the selection panel.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} [[Richard Wassell]] was appointed as Assistant Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}}\n\n[[File:CBSO first concert -

popular classics established by his own orchestra over the previous five years.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} The orchestra first rehearsed at 9.30am on 4 September 1920, in the band room at the

of music performed being [[Granville Bantock]]'s ''Saul''.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=24}} After two months of preparing the orchestra with the popular concerts,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the inaugural concert of the Symphony Concerts series was given at the Town Hall on 10 November 1920, with [[Edward Elgar]] conducting a concert of his own works,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} including [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|his Cello Concerto]] with [[Felix Salmond]] as the soloist. The first season continued with a remarkable series of programmes, including [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] conducting his own ''[[A London Symphony|London Symphony]]'', [[Hamilton Harty]] conducting [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]\u2019s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', [[Adrian Boult]] conducting [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]\u2019s [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]], [[Landon Ronald]] conducting [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]\u2019 [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Symphony]] and [[Jean Sibelius]] conducting his own [[Symphony No. 3 (Sibelius)|Third Symphony]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Christopher|last=Morley|title=A glorious 90 years for CBSO|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/music/glorious-90-years-cbso-3925711|newspaper=Birmingham Post|publisher=Trinity Mirror Midlands|date=2013-05-30|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> Two features that would become longstanding traditions for the orchestra were also established during this first year: performances of then-recent works by Holst, Vaughan Williams and Bax saw a strong representation of new music in the orchestra's programmes; and from February 1921 the orchestra's commitment to musical education was underlined with a series of concerts for city schoolchildren held in the Town Hall on Saturday afternoons.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=248}}\n\nMatthews had originally been appointed to be conductor with a fee of \u00a3450 for 30 concerts, but had persuaded the committee to give him instead the combined role of conductor, secretary and manager for a fee of \u00a31,000 per year.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=247}} He had only limited experience in any of these roles, however,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=26}} and developed a difficult relationship with the politicians and businessmen who made up the CBO committee.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}} His plan to supplement the playing strength of the orchestra with members of the [[Birmingham City Police]] band almost caused the orchestra to strike before it had even played a concert,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=27}} and resulted in questions being asked in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in December 1920.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} Matthews' conducting and his management were both poorly reviewed by Birmingham-based critics, though reviews from outside the city were more positive, with the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' being highly complimentary and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' concluding \"Manchester may well envy Birmingham its municipal music\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=29-30}} Matthews' Symphony Series programmes were highly ambitious and enterprising,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} and he was able to claim that \"the amount subscribed for Symphony Concerts constituted a record for any similar series of concerts in this city\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} but the Sunday concerts were loss-making, with the expensive seats often unsold.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=29}} In 1922 Matthews was relieved of any involvement in the financial administration of the orchestra,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=250}} popular concerts were increasingly moved to suburban and out-of-town venues, and development and marketing plans were drawn up to stem a deficit which by May 1923 grown to \u00a33,000.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}} In July the orchestra and Matthews both engaged solicitors and in October Matthews was informed his contract was to be terminated,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=31-32}}  His final CBO concert was on 30 March 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=32}} and the relationship dissolved in acrimonious and expensive litigation.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=34}}\n\n=== Boult and the first \"golden period\" ===\n[[File:Sir Adrian Boult by Ishibashi Kazunori (Royal College of Music).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Adrian Boult]] in 1923 by [[Ishibashi Kazunori]]]]\nThe CBO committee had two candidates in mind to replace Matthews: [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] and [[Adrian Boult]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=33}} For a while the committee explored the possibility of appointing both as joint conductors, but were convinced by [[Ernest de S\u00e9lincourt]] that this idea was unworkable.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=97}} Boult had recently replaced [[Henry Wood]] as the conductor of the [[Birmingham Festival Choral Society]]{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=112}} &ndash; possibly calculating that there might shortly be a vacancy with the City Orchestra{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} &ndash; and in March 1924 he was announced in the press as the CBO's new Director and Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=36}} At the age of 35 he already had a substantial international musical reputation, having studied at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] under [[Arthur Nikisch]], conducted the world premier of [[Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'' at the age of 25, and worked for a period as chief conductor of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=251}} The urbane, Oxford-educated Boult was also comfortable dealing with influential local citizens, ensuring the orchestra retained the financial support it needed to continue.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} His tenure at the CBO would mark the start of a \"golden period\" for the orchestra{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=52}} that would see it rise to national prominence,{{sfn|Jenkins|King-Smith|1983|p=1}} outshining the struggling London orchestras{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=9}} and establishing Boult himself as a major figure of British musical life.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=34-35}}\n\nBoult brought a wider vision for the orchestra's future,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} building on Matthews' foundations but expanding beyond them.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} Some of the leading conductors in Europe were brought in to guest conduct, including [[Bruno Walter]], [[Pierre Monteux]], [[Ernest Ansermet]] and [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=252}} Boult introduced lunchtime concerts at the Town Hall,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} inaugurated lectures about forthcoming music on the Thursdays before symphony concerts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} invited students from the [[University of Birmingham]] to attend open rehearsals,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=39}} and introduced free concerts for children during school hours.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=129}} The orchestra made its first commercial recording in 1925.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=39-40}} A more unusual experiment took place later the same year, when [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Second Piano Concerto]] was performed at the Town Hall with [[Harold Bauer]] as soloist, but with his part played not with him present but as a pre-recorded [[piano roll]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} A particular concern of Boult's was to reduce the effect of the summer break when, as with London's [[Queen's Hall|Queen's Hall Orchestra]] and Manchester's [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=93}} the CBO's musicians spent the summer working at seaside resorts and often picked up bad habits freelancing for pier orchestras.{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=252-253}} The committee felt unable at that time to meet Boult's desire to offer players permanent year-round contracts,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=45}} but Boult tried to lessen the length of the break by initiating performances at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s throughout the Midlands.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and building up the orchestra's diary of out-of-town concerts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}}\n\nThe immediate impact of Boult's arrival was conveyed by the ''Birmingham Post'' reviewing his first season: \"The strongest impression is of a very great gain in note accuracy, a much improved ensemble, and a high standard of playing from the string group. The advance made within a single season is so considerable as to be remarkable.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=104}} The orchestra also moved into more adventurous repertoire,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} for example performing [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' less than a year after its composition, while the composer was little-known in England.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}} The CBO's performance of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] in 1926 was only the third performance of any Mahler symphony given in Britain,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=112}} and that of ''[[Das Lied von der Erde]]'' was only the second time it had been performed in England.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Both were followed shortly afterwards by performances by orchestras in London and marked the start of the gradual increase in interest in Mahler's work in Britain.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=133}}\n\nBy 1926 the orchestra's finances had improved,{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=113}} helped by the City Council's decision in 1924 to allow [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to be used rent-free for the Symphony concerts{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1925 to double the CBO's grant to \u00a32,500 annually.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} Less positive was the collapse in October 1925 of the Town Hall's ceiling, leading the orchestra to move its concerts temporarily to [[Methodist Central Hall, Birmingham|Central Hall]] on [[Corporation Street, Birmingham|Corporation Street]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=41}} Expenditure on repairing the Town Hall put back prospects of the new concert hall that Boult had been promised,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=42}} and the reconfiguration of the hall from one gallery to two &ndash; engineered by London-based architect [[Charles Allom]] without consulting any local musicians &ndash; created acoustic problems that would dog the orchestra until its move to [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]] six decades later: the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' wrote that \"everything sounded strange\" and complained of acoustic dead spots in the ground floor and lower gallery.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=43, 45}}\n\nOne aspect of Boult's time at the CBO was the development of an important relationship with the recently established [[BBC]]. The CBO's concert at Birmingham Town Hall on 7 October 1924 was the first orchestral concert anywhere in the world to be transmitted as an [[outside broadcast]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=38}} and in 1924 and early 1925 the CBO was used to perform four \"International Symphony Concerts\" at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in London,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=40}} supplementing the BBC's own \"Wireless Players\" to form the \"Wireless Symphony Orchestra\", the forerunner of the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=10}} In 1927 the relationship became more problematic as the BBC stopped broadcasting CBO concerts as a result of national dispute with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians Union]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=42, 45}} and in 1928 upgraded the orchestra at its Birmingham station, luring sixteen of the CBO's most important players away with full-time contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=46}} In May 1929 the BBC went a stage further, when the retirement of its Music Director [[Percy Pitt]] saw Boult offered the role as his replacement.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=130}} Boult was happy in Birmingham and had planned to stay at least another ten years,{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} but was encouraged to accept the BBC role by [[Henry Wood]].{{sfn|Kenyon|1981|p=39}} He resisted [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]]'s pressure to take up the BBC post immediately and agreed instead to perform a further final season with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=47-48}} He later said he regretted leaving Birmingham,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=254}} which provided the only time in his career he was able to fully control his own programmes.{{sfn|Kennedy|1987|p=100}}\n\n===Consolidation under Heward===\n[[File:Leslie Heward Cape Town Postcard crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leslie Heward]]]]\nFour conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts &ndash; [[Leslie Heward]], [[Stanley Chapple]], [[Julius Harrison]] and [[Basil Cameron]] &ndash; but Boult later described how \"Heward very easily won the palm\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=48}} Heward had studied conducting under Boult at the [[Royal College of Music]], where [[Hubert Parry]] had described him as \"the kind of phenomenon that appears once in a generation\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as Music Director of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and Conductor of the [[Cape Town Orchestra]], where he had raised the standards of the orchestra's playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} Despite this, his appointment was a gamble for the CBO committee, as he was still largely unknown to English audiences.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}}\n\nHeward soon gained the respect of the orchestra's players and the Birmingham audience for his formidable musicianship.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}} His score-reading ability was exceptional and he was able to instantly diagnose problems in rehearsal - the CBO's flautist remarked that he had \"never known a conductor who was so much respected by his players.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} He was also known for his honesty and integrity, sometimes restarting a public performance he felt to be substandard halfway through, saying \"I'm sorry, we can do better than that.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=113}}  His programming in Birmingham was bold: 28 of the 41 pieces played in his first season were Birmingham premieres,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} and the orchestra became particularly known for its interpretations of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvorak]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and modern British composers.<ref>{{cite

(Hays)|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/12959|accessdate=2017-01-28|publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref> The orchestra under Heward also began to attract front-rank soloists: [[Arthur De Greef (composer)|Arthur de Greef]] and [[Nikolai Orlov (pianist)|Nikolai Orlov]] performed in 1931;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} [[Artur Schnabel]] played [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] in 1933;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=58-59}} [[Ernst Victor Wolff|Ernst Wolff]], [[Arthur Catterall]], [[Egon Petri]], [[Frederic Lamond (pianist)|Frederic Lamond]] performed in 1934;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=61}} [[Adolf Busch]] and [[Solomon (pianist)|Solomon]] in 1936;{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=62-63}} and in 1938 [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] played one of his own Piano Concertos.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=64}}\n\nAssistant Conductor [[Joseph Lewis (conductor)|Joseph Lewis]] followed Boult to the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in 1931.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} His eventual replacement, [[Harold Gray]], had started his 55-year-long association with the orchestra as Boult's secretary and musical amanuensis in 1924,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=37}} and had first conducted the orchestra in 1930 in [[Sutton Coldfield]] where he was organist at parish church.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=50}} Heward was reluctant to talk to audiences and didn't enjoy performing for schoolchildren{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=54}} so Gray took over children's concerts in 1931{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}} and was appointed Deputy Conductor in 1932.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=56}}\n\nThe Symphony concerts under Heward drew excellent attendances, but audiences continued to drop for concerts of popular classics as competition from radio and the cinema for leisure time activity increased.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=59, 61}} Relief from the resulting financial pressure came through a series of arrangements with the BBC.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} In 1930 the broadcaster agreed to reduce its Birmingham orchestra to an octet &ndash; with the redundant musicians being auditioned by the CBO &ndash; in return for the CBO performing 13 studio concerts each season: an important step towards permanent year-round contracts for the CBO's players.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=55}} In 1934 [[Percy Edgar]] and [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]] agreed to establish the [[BBC Midland Orchestra]] playing 2-3 concerts a week, with Heward as conductor and 35 of its musicians shared with the CBO on 12-month contracts.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=60}} The stability this brought meant that Heward could build on the achievements of the previous 15 years{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=62}} and by the late 1930s the CBO was playing to a standard comparable to the orchestras of major cities of continental Europe.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=255}}\n\nBy 1939, the CBO's finances were looking sound and its future bright.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=66}} The outbreak of [[World War II]], however, saw the BBC disband its Midland Orchestra and lay off its musicians, many of whom were also leading players with the CBO.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} [[Birmingham Town Hall]] was commandeered for the war effort and the CBO cancelled all of its engagements, giving Heward six months notice of termination.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=67-68}} Although the orchestra started performing again at the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]] in October as the \"City of Birmingham (Emergency) Orchestra\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=68}} and was able to reinstate Heward on a series of temporary contracts,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}}it had lost many of its prewar players,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=71}} and would be composed only of part-time musicians for much of the war.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=74-75}} Compounding the difficulties was Heward's illness.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He had contracted [[tuberculosis]] during his period in South Africa{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=53}} and was already missing concerts with illness by 1934.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=60-61}} Aggravated by overwork, smoking and heavy drinking, his condition deteriorated and he spent six months in a sanatorium from September 1939 to May 1940.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=67}} He gave his first performance for over a year on 20 October 1940, but regularly had to cancel engagements after that,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=70}} with most of the CBO's concerts during the period being conducted by [[Victor Hely-Hutchinson]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=256}} On Boxing Day 1942 Heward was offered the post of Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]] in [[Manchester]], tendering his resignation with effect from the end of the season, but he did not live to see out his contract, dying at his [[Edgbaston]] home in May 1943.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=75-76}}\n\n=== Post-war doldrums ===\nBy 1944, the wartime orchestra numbered only 62 musicians, all of whom were part-time and most of whom were employees of local munitions factories.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} Weekly concerts took place after only a single rehearsal and different players often performed from concert to concert.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=80}} In an attempt to provide some stability the committee introduced permanent year-round contracts for musicians from May 1944,{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=259}} funded by the city council's education committee in return for 50 days of educational work from the orchestra per year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=81}} [[Boyd Neel]] was initially favoured to replace Heward as Principal Conductor after 12 different applicants were given trial concerts over the summer of 1943,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=78-79}} but the orchestra eventually announced the appointment on a one-year contract of [[George Weldon]], the conductor of the [[City of Birmingham Choir]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=258-259}} Weldon was flamboyant and charismatic with a love of fast cars and he cut a glamorous figure on the podium.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=258}} Initial critical and public reaction was very positive and in June 1944 he was confirmed as Music Director.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=81-82}} He broadened the orchestra's reach by introducing modestly-priced summer seasons of promenade concerts from 1945,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=84}} and from 1950 introduced industrial concerts aimed at the city's manufacturing workforce, alongside annual seasons in [[Wolverhampton]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=98}} In January 1948 the orchestra was officially renamed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at Weldon's personal request.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=93}}\n\nWeldon's success in rebuilding the orchestra after the ravages of war was limited, however: he recruited over 40 new musicians during his tenure but by 1951 had only succeeded in increasing the playing strength to 73.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} Year-round contracts demanded a heavy workload \u2013 during the 1945\u201346 season the orchestra played 260 concerts as well as undertaking educational work in the city's schools \u2013 meaning that most concerts were rehearsed only on the day of a performance.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=88}} Audiences were also unpredictable, and Weldon was criticised for programming too much lightweight repertoire.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=260}} The era saw some performances of new compositions including major works composed by the orchestra's oboist [[Ruth Gipps]], and September 1946 brought [[Samuel Barber]] to Birmingham to conduct his own [[Symphony in One Movement (Barber)|First Symphony]], but Weldon repeated popular works multiple times, often twice or more within the same season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=89}} In 1946 [[Eric Blom]] criticised the orchestra for over-performance of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]' ''Fantasia on \"[[Greensleeves]]'''', with the orchestra responding by performing the work in a further concert, backwards.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=87}} The music critic of the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' was sacked in 1945 for writing that other music journalists in the city were covering up the orchestra's low standards,{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=260-261}} but by 1948 critics were writing openly of the orchestra's decline.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=263}} An anti-Weldon lobby formed among Birmingham's musical establishment{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} and unsubstantiated rumours circulated that he was conducting an affair with Gipps.<ref>{{Citation|last=Halstead|first=Jill|year=2006|title=Ruth Gipps:

would later head the CBSO's council of management and started attending CBSO concerts in 1951, later recalled of the period: \"a pretty awful sound they made, it was a poor orchestra.\"{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=109}}\n\nWith attendance at CBSO concerts averaging only 60% of capacity, the ''Birmingham Post'' ran a series of articles in 1949 arguing for a new approach.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=97}} By the next year, the orchestra had a deficit of \u00a35,000.  In 1951, the incoming executive chairman of the CBSO committee approached [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]] to take over as the orchestra's new chief conductor, letting Weldon know that his contract would not be renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=264}} [[John Barbirolli]] was furious at Weldon's treatment and immediately appointed him Associate Conductor of the [[Hall\u00e9 Orchestra]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=100}} but the committee considered the move a \"change to a conductor of a higher calibre\" and Weldon's replacement was viewed by the CBSO's players as a forward looking one.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=102}} Schwarz had a well-established career as an operatic conductor in pre-war Germany, but his role as Music Director of the Jewish Cultural Organisation in Berlin led to him being interned by the Nazis in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Belsen]], from where he was rescued in 1945.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=103-104}} He was highly respected among musicians and had rebuilt the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]] after World War II.{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=114}} Adrian Boult wrote to him commending Birmingham as having \"the nicest people\" and assuring him he would enjoy the city, with Schwarz later concluding \"He was absolutely right! I found that Birmingham was ''alive'' - a city with people who work.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=104}}\n\nFrom the start, Schwarz's programming was radically different to Weldon's, reflecting a Central European repertoire alongside many unfamiliar British works.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=104-105}} He reserved an entire day per week for rehearsals, which, despite resistance from conservative orchestral players, quickly began to bear fruit,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=105}} and the orchestra began to attract front-rank soloists again.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=107}} However, fewer concerts, more rehearsal time and falling attendance led to a worsening financial crisis with a deficit of \u00a320,000 in 1952, and for a period it was suggested the CBSO should merge with the Bournemouth orchestra, performing in Birmingham during the winter and Bournemouth in the summer. When this proposal collapsed, the committee planned instead to reduce the orchestra to a six-month operation, until the incoming Labour council agreed to write off the accumulated deficit in May 1952 with an interest-free loan.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=106}} At this time the CBSO was by far the smallest of Britain's regional orchestras,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=108}} but an increase in private donations allowed it to expand the playing staff in 1953,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=110}} and an administrative reorganisation and further increase in support from the city council began to place it on a firmer financial footing.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=109}} The orchestra made its first television appearance in 1954{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=114}} and in 1955 visited the Netherlands on its first overseas tour.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=115}} Most significant were the performances in 1955 and 1956 of the first of a series of new works commissioned for the orchestra by the [[John Feeney Charitable Trust]] \u2013 [[Arthur Bliss]]'s ''[[Meditations on a Theme by John Blow]]'' and [[Michael Tippett]]'s [[Piano Concerto (Tippett)|Piano Concerto]] \u2013 though reviews of the nationally broadcast premiere of the second still brought criticism from the ''[[Musical Times]]'' for the orchestra's \"shaky playing\".{{sfn|Handford|2006|pp=265-266}} Schwarz himself later recalled of his period in charge of the CBSO: \"the orchestra did gradually improve, but some of the playing was still not ideal\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=113}}\n\n=== Panufnik and the return of Boult ===\n[[File:Andrzej Panufnik Polish composer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andrzej Panufnik]]]]\nIn September 1956 Schwarz announced that he would be leaving the CBSO for the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] at the end of the following season.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=118}} Press speculation about a successor centred on [[Hugo Rignold]], but it was [[George Hurst (conductor)|George Hurst]] and [[Andrzej Panufnik]] who were given trial concerts the following December, and Panufnik who was subsequently appointed after a performance described in the CBSO's official history as \"sensationally successful\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Panufnik was best known as a composer, but had built a career as a conductor with the [[Krak\u00f3w Philharmonic Orchestra]]  and [[Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] in his native [[Poland]] before [[Defection|defecting]] to England in 1954.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=268}} His first season in Birmingham was highly adventurous, featuring the British premieres of works by [[Ernest Bloch]], [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] and [[Ferenc Farkas]]. Many early English works for small chamber ensembles were included alongside later classical and romantic repertoire, and some concerts would start with only 13 players on the platform.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=123}}\n\nPanufnik's arrival in Birmingham coincided with conflict between the orchestra and management after 16 violinists were asked to re-audition for their places, and a strike was only averted by a management climb down.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=121}} Although he later claimed that he \"found the orchestra of a high standard\", Panufnik's experience of working with some of Europe's leading orchestras left him dissatisfied with the CBSO's string sound.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} He had the support of the orchestra's younger players,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=139}} but his attempts to improve the string section brought him into conflict with the [[Concertmaster|orchestra leader]] Norris Stanley, who had played with the orchestra since its foundation in 1920 and rejected Panufnik's authority, resisting all attempts at change.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=152}} Stanley was persuaded to resign in 1958 and was followed by many of the orchestra's old guard, and as a result Panufnik's second season featured less personal conflict.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=125-126}} At the insistence of the orchestra's management it also included four of his own compositions.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=154}} In 1959, however, Panufnik decided not to renew his contract, intending to concentrate instead on composition, explaining \"I have learnt one thing. It is impossible to conduct a permanent orchestra and compose at the same time.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=127}} He continued to have good relations with the orchestra and premiered his [[Piano Concerto]] with the CBSO in 1962.{{sfn|Boles\u0142awska|2017|p=158}}\n\nPanufnik's unexpectedly early departure created problems for the CBSO's management, who had intended for him ultimately to be succeeded by [[Meredith Davies]], who had been appointed in 1957 from over 150 applicants as the orchestra's second Associate Conductor alongside [[Harold Gray]].{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=269}} Although Davies was offered the Principal Conductor role and was considered to have the confidence of the players, he felt he was still unprepared for the position and suggested that \"an eminent conductor\" be appointed for the 1959\u20131960 season with the intention that Davies would take over the following year.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Davies was therefore appointed as Deputy Music Director, and [[Adrian Boult]] returned for one year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=141}} Boult had given up the role of  principal conductor of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] two years previously and was still much in demand as a guest conductor, but agreed to return to Birmingham in a move described by [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] as \"combining nostalgia and a generous rescue act\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=128}} Boult's season saw him conduct the premiere of [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]]'s Violin Concerto with its dedicatee [[Ernest Element]], and a performance of [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Brahm's 4th symphony]] described by [[Robert Matthew-Walker]] as \"the greatest performance of Brahms' fourth symphony I have ever heard.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=129}} John Waterhouse of the ''Birmingham Post'' wrote that under Boult the CBSO again \"sounded as good as any orchestra in the country\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=130}}\n\n=== Rebuilding under Rignold ===\nIn early 1960 the CBSO committee were still planning for Boult's deputy [[Meredith Davies]] to succeed him as Principal Conductor, but Davies had formed an increasingly close working relationship with [[Benjamin Britten]] after taking over conducting duties at a CBSO concert of Britten's works, and in March 1960 he left the orchestra to work with Britten's [[English Opera Group]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=129-130}} Two months later [[Hugo Rignold]] was announced as the CBSO's new Principal Conductor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} Rignold had established his reputation as one of the country's leading conductors during six years at the [[Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], subsequently serving as Music Director of the [[Royal Ballet]] and guest conducting with major orchestras across Britain, Europe and America.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=131-132}} He had conducted the CBSO numerous times since 1955{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=131}} and was noted for his professionalism and technical expertise.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=132}} He had particular strengths as an orchestra trainer and under him consistent signs of the orchestra's potential began to emerge for the first time since the war.<ref name=\"Grove-Birmingham\" /> \n\nRelations between the orchestra's management and players at the time was poor.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=132-133}} The summer of 1962 saw the musicians unanimously hand in their notice in a wage dispute,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}} and in 1965 the orchestra suffered the only strike in its history after the demotion of [[Musician's Union]] steward Wilfred Pook from the first to the second violins - an affair reported in the press as \"Pook's pique\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} Rignold however was seen as bringing stability after the turbulence of the Panufnik era and Boult's stopgap year.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The last players remaining from the orchestra's first season in 1920 had retired by 1967,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=158}} and Rignold proved an astute judge of musicians, introducing many excellent young players to the orchestra and improving professionalism and discipline.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=137, 151}} He demanded high standards and audiences experienced noticeable improvements.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} By 1963 the orchestra was seeing much improved reviews in the London press.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} The growing prestige of the CBSO made it easier to attract international artists: soloists at CBSO concerts included [[Wilhelm Kempff]], [[Clifford Curzon]], [[Ida Haendel]], [[Paul Tortelier]], [[Isaac Stern]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]];{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=149, 152}} and notable guest conductors included [[Antal Dorati]], [[Jascha Horenstein]], [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Ferdinand Leitner]] and [[Nadia Boulanger]], who conducted a programme of works by her sister [[Lili Boulanger]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}}{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=153}}\n\nRignold updated the orchestra's repertoire, conducting 31 premieres during his tenure.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=162}} The era saw Birmingham's first complete performances of works including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'', [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9]]'', [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht]]'' and [[William Walton|Walton]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Walton)|Violin Concerto]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} and a series themed around \"Masterpieces of the Twentieth Century\" was held in 1966 and 1967.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=148}} Like [[Leslie Heward]] and [[Rudolf Schwarz]] before him, Rignold was particularly committed to the music of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=134}} giving a complete cycle of his symphonies in 1966.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} The most significant premiere of the period, indeed of the CBSO's entire history,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} saw the orchestra play the first performance of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'' at the dedication of [[Coventry Cathedral]] in 1962, accompanied by [[Peter Pears]], [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], [[Heather Harper]] and the [[Melos Ensemble]], conducted by Meredith Davies and the composer himself.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}}  This event saw the orchestra attracting international attention for the first time since the first Boult era.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=163}} The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the work as \"a masterpiece of the first order\", Fischer-Dieskau wept during rehearsals and at the end of the performance Harper noticed that \"all around her people were in tears\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=135}}\n\nThe Rignold era also saw modernisation of the CBSO's operations.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} The orchestra undertook two major European tours in 1963 and 1968, and in 1966 made its first commercial recordings since 1948,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=161}} producing its first [[LP record|long playing record]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=145}} 1963 saw the orchestra solvent and free of debt for the first time in over a decade,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=136}} leading to an increase in permanent strength to 88.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} The workload of the orchestra remained extremely high though: throughout the 1960s it gave annual concert series in [[Coventry]], [[Nottingham]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Dudley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[London]] as well as regular performances in [[Leeds]] and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} It performed two seasons every year supporting [[Welsh National Opera]], which had no orchestra of its own,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=141}} it accompanied choral societies throught the Midlands,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=140}} and continued to provide 50 days of education work each year in Birmingham schools.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=133}} Despite playing more concerts than the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool]], [[The Hall\u00e9|Hall\u00e9]] or [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth]] orchestras it received a smaller grant from the [[Arts Council]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=139}} until increases in 1966 finally brought the it into line.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=146}}\n\n=== Fr\u00e9maux and \"the best French orchestra in the World\"===\n[[File:Louis Fr\u00e9maux (1975).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]]]]\nDespite the progress under [[Hugo Rignold]], by the late 1960s the CBSO committee were beginning to look for a new conductor who could take the orchestra further,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=150-151}} and in 1967 Rignold resigned after being offered a one-year contract extension instead of having his existing three-year deal renewed.{{sfn|Handford|2006|p=275}} This left the orchestra without a principal conductor for the 1968-1969 season, but also left it free to give trials to potential replacements.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=152}} [[Norman Del Mar]] and [[Walter Susskind]] both gave successful concerts, but the strong favourite throughout the process was the conductor of the first concert, the Frenchman [[Louis Fr\u00e9maux]], whose appointment was announced from autumn 1969.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=152-153}} Fr\u00e9maux had made his reputation with the [[Monte Carlo Orchestra]], particularly for his recordings of French music, releasing over 30 recordings and winning 8 [[Grand Prix du Disque]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=154}} For the first three years of his appointment in Birmingham he combined his role with continuing as the founding conductor of the [[Orchestre National de Lyon|Orchestre Philharmonique Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] in [[Lyon]],{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} but in 1972 he resigned from Lyon to concentrate on his Birmingham activities, performing 70 concerts a season with the CBSO even though only contracted to provide 30.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=167}}\n\nFr\u00e9maux oversaw a vast improvement in the CBSO's orchestral standards,{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} drawing from the orchestra a previously unheard-of precision and verve.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} Regular sectional rehearsals were brought in from 1970{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} and Fr\u00e9maux brought a new emphasis on the recruitment of young principals, setting up a complex system of auditions and trial periods{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=159-160}} and attending over 900 auditions himself.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} His opening concert drew \"ecstatic\" reviews from London critics,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=155}} and by 1970 ''The Guardian'' could write that \"there is no better British orchestra outside London\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=160}} By 1972 the same newspaper was going further, writing that \"under Fremaux they combine a purity of intonation which metropolitan orchestras might envy, with a fluid and spontaneous style of phrasing\".{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} The commercial success of Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO recordings for EMI firmly established its reputation for French music, with recordings of [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Organ Symphony]]'' and [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Requiem (Berlioz)|Grande Messe des morts]]'' being particularly successful.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=169}} Fr\u00e9maux's CBSO also had a high reputation in romantic repertoire by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k|Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] as well as twentieth century work such as [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[William Walton|Walton]] and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]].{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} The distinctive sound that characterised the orchestra under Fr\u00e9maux was considered less well-suited to classic Viennese repertoire such as [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]].{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}}\n\nThe popularity of Fr\u00e9maux's concerts saw attendances at [[Birmingham Town Hall]] increase from an average of 67% in 1968-69 to 88% in 1970-71,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=166}} with 45% of the audience aged under 25.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=158}} In response, plans were drawn up by the architect [[John Madin]] in 1970 for a new concert hall to be builton the site of [[Bingley Hall]] just off [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]], and when this scheme was halted by a financial crisis at the city council it was replaced by a proposal from local television station [[Associated Television|ATV]] for a multi-purpose exhibition and concert hall as part of its new studio centre.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=158-159}} This was turned down by the city council for being impractical,{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=159}} and instead in 1972 the Town Hall was extensively refurbished with double glazing and more room on the platform, but little improvement in acoustics - the orchestra's manager Arthur Baker commented that \"we still have the same woolly sound\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=163}} More positive developments included the orchestra's first commercial sponsorship{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}} and the foundation in 1973 of the [[CBSO Chorus]], established under [[Gordon Clinton]] to give the orchestra complete artistic control over its choral backing for its burgeoning recording activities..{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=168}}\n\nFor all its triumphs Fr\u00e9maux's tenure in Birmingham was to end in chaos and acrimony. In 1969 Birmingham City Council had cancelled the CBSO's regular programme of visits to local schools for budgetary reasons.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=156}} In their place manager Arthur Baker developed a partnership with promoter [[Victor Hochhauser]] for the orchestra to perform lucrative series of mass-market concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, but constant travelling away from Birmingham and repetitive popular repertoire began to have a negative effect on player morale.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=170}} The CBSO in the 1960s and 1970s had a particular reputation for political activism{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=178}} and Fr\u00e9maux became increasingly uneasy with the amount of internal unrest.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=176}} Matters were made worse when Fr\u00e9maux appointed Baker as his personal agent alongside his role as orchestral manager: the players began to feel that Baker was prioritising Fr\u00e9maux's interests over the orchestra's artistic development{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=179}} and started compiling a dossier of supporting evidence.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=171}} A humiliating climbdown in a dispute with the players over the seating of a freelance viola player in February 1978 led Fr\u00e9maux to decide that he would not renew his contract, later complaining that \"The union wanted to manage the orchestra. Some of them wanted a revolution.\"{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}} The next month, however, a vote of no confidence from the players in Baker led to his resignation, with Fr\u00e9maux himself also resigning out of personal loyalty.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} The players stressed that Fr\u00e9maux retained their support,{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=171-172}} but he never conducted the orchestra again{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=180}}\n\nAlthough the loss of the orchestra's Manager and  Music Director in a single week was a crisis in the short term, it resulted in a series of longer term changes that would have more positive effects.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} The Swiss avant-garde composer and conductor [[Erich Schmid]] was found at short notice to take over Fremaux's immediate conducting commitments, including a Beethoven festival due to take place less than two months later, and the resulting artistic triumph saw him appointed as the orchestra's first Principal Guest Conductor in September 1979.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|pp=174-175}} The structure of the orchestra's management committees was reformed, with two elected players' representatives on the main decision-making body to improve communications between musicians and management.{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Baker's role as General Manager was taken by Ed Smith, who came from the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], where he had worked closely for many years with the conductor of the youth orchestra, [[Simon Rattle]].{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}} Rattle had performed four well-received concerts with the CBSO over the previous year and had made no secret of his interest in the Birmingham position.{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|pp=184-185}} Smith later commented that \"Simon was still an unknown quantity to most people, but not, of course, to me. I pushed very hard to have him appointed\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} For the first time the appointment of a Principal Conductor required a poll of the musicians as well as the agreement of the committee of management, but on 2 July 1979 Rattle was announced as the orchestra's \"Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor\".{{sfn|King-Smith|1995|p=185}} The ''Birmingham Post'' wrote of Fr\u00e9maux that \"whatever the circumstances of his going, he was the man who raised the CBSO to the highest point of prestige in its history to date\",{{sfn|Kenyon|2001|p=115}} while Rattle joked that he had inherited \"possibly the best French orchestra in the world.\"{{sfn|Bratby|2019|p=175}}\n\n===Rattle and after===\n[[File:Symphony-Hall-Birmingham-from-Upper Circle.jpg|thumb|[[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]], the orchestra's home since 1991]]\nThe CBSO began to gain greater international renown after [[Simon Rattle]] became chief conductor in 1980. Under him, the orchestra increased its recording profile and became one of the leading ensembles in Europe, and gained a name for its interpretations of late [[romantic music|romantic]] and 20th century works, especially those of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and [[Gustav Mahler]]. During this period, the orchestra moved from [[Birmingham Town Hall]] to a new home venue, [[Symphony Hall (Birmingham)|Symphony Hall]], inside Birmingham's [[International Convention Centre, Birmingham|International Convention Centre]]. The nearby [[CBSO Centre]], a converted factory, houses management offices, rehearsal facilities, and is a concert venue in its own right, for more intimate performances.

{"title_page": "Research and development in Japan", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=October 2018}}\n[[Research and development]] became increasingly important to the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] through the 1970s and 1980s and obtained significant support from the Japanese government.\n\n==Growth of R&D==\nAs its economy matured in the 1970s and 1980s, [[Japan]] gradually shifted away from dependence on foreign research. Japan's ability to conduct independent research and development became a decisive factor in boosting the nation's competitiveness. As early as 1980, the [[Japan Science and Technology Agency]], a component of the [[Kantei]] (office of the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]]) announced the beginning of \"the era of Japan's technological independence.\"\n\nBy 1986 Japan had come to devote a higher proportion of its [[Measures of national income and output|GNP]] to research and development than the [[United States]]. In 1989 nearly 700,000 Japanese were engaged in research and development, more than the number of [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[West Germany|West Germans]] combined. At the same time, Japan was producing more [[engineer]]s than any country except the United States and [[Soviet Union]]. Similar trends were seen in the use of capital resources. Japan spent US$39.1 billion on government and private research and development in 1987, equivalent to 2.9 percent of its [[national income]] (the highest ratio in the world). Although the United States spent around US$108.2 billion on research and development in 1987, only 2.6 percent of its income was devoted to that purpose, ranking it third behind Japan and West Germany.\n\nThe Japanese reputation for originality also increased. Of the 1.2 million [[patent]]s registered worldwide in 1985, 40 percent were Japanese, and Japanese citizens took out 19 percent of the 120,000 patent applications made in the United States. In 1987 around 33 percent of [[computer]]-related patents in the United States were Japanese, as were 30 percent of [[aviation]]-related patents and 26 percent of [[communication]]s patents.\n\n==Government initiatives==\nDespite its advances in technological research and development and its major commitment to applied research, however, Japan significantly trailed other [[Developed country|developed nations]] in basic [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. In 1989 about 13 percent of Japanese research and development funds were devoted to basic research. The proportion of basic research expenses borne by government was also much lower in Japan than in the United States, as was Japan's ratio of basic research expenses to GNP. In the late 1980s, the Japanese government attempted to rectify national deficiencies in basic research by waging a broad \"originality\" campaign in [[Education in Japan|schools]], by generously funding research, and by encouraging private cooperation in various fields.\n\nMost research and development is private, although government support to [[Higher education in Japan|universities]] and laboratories aid industry greatly. In 1986 private industry provided 76 percent of the funding for research and development, which was especially strong in the late 1980s in [[electrical machinery]] (with a ratio of research costs to total sales of 5.5 percent in 1986), [[Precision instrument|precision instruments]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} (4.6 percent), [[Chemical industry|chemicals]] (4.3 percent), and [[transportation]] equipment (3.2 percent).\n\nAs for government research and development, the national commitment to greater [[Military budget|defense spending]] in the 1980s translated into increased defense-related research and development. Meanwhile, government moved away from supporting large-scale industrial technology, such as [[shipbuilding]] and [[steel]]. Research emphases in the 1980s were in [[alternative energy]], [[information processing]], [[life sciences]], and modern industrial materials and supplies.\n\n==Current situation==\nIn 2016, the total spending on R&D in Japan was 165.7 billion USD by PPP, which represents around 3% of the country's GDP PPP.\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.complore.com Social Research Collaboration Tool for Researchers]\n* {{loc}} - Dolan, R.
