Usually held on a Saturday night in late March or early April, the show honors the year's biggest [[television]], [[movie]], and [[music]] acts as voted by viewers worldwide of [[Nickelodeon]] networks. Winners receive a hollow orange [[blimp]] figurine, a logo outline for much of the network's 1984\u20132009 era, which also functions as a [[kaleidoscope]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/kids-17366-awards-says.html|title=Kids' Choice Awards grow up; The Nickelodeon celebration of burps and slime has become a star-studded affair.|last=Larsen|first=Peter|date=March 30, 2007|work=[[Orange County Register]]|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}</ref> \n\nThe show features numerous [[celebrity]] guests and musical acts. Since 2002, [[Slime (toy)|slime]] stunts have been incorporated into the show. The KCAs also host live entertainment. It has also been known to overwhelmingly cover people with the network's trademark [[Green slime (You Can't Do That on Television)|green slime]]. The series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' has won the most KCA awards, with sixteen overall through the series' run. Individually, [[Selena Gomez]] has won the most trophies with eleven, followed by [[Will Smith]] (10) and [[Adam Sandler]] (9). [[Whoopi Goldberg]] is the only person to have won a Kids' Choice Award, along with the mainstream \"[[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]\" combination of an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and [[Tony Award|Tony]]. [[Rosie O'Donnell]] has hosted the show most times (8), followed by [[Jack Black]] (3), and [[John Cena]] (2).\n\n==History==\n[[Alan Goodman]], [[Albie Hecht]], and [[Fred Seibert]] created the awards show after Nickelodeon produced a show called ''[[The Big Ballot]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Nickelodeon lowering the voting age|date=March 8, 1987|first=|last=|newspaper=Atlanta Journal; Atlanta Constitution |page=T/30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kids Vote for 'Karate Kid II'|date=March 28, 1987|first=|last=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kids Like Cos|date=April 6, 1987|first=Virginia|last=Painter|newspaper=USA Today |page=01.D}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Stamberg Never Rests on Sunday|date=April 7, 1987|first=|last=|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News |page=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Monkee Business|date=April 13, 1987|first=Tracey|last=Wong Briggs|newspaper=USA Today|page=01.D}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oASjjJbT6Xg|title=Nickelodeon's Big Ballot|medium=Video|publisher=retrorocker|date=April 18, 2012|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> in 1987, named for the ballots kids voted with. To vote, the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show, the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a thank you video that would be shown during the program. Goodman, Hecht, and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger, more exciting platform.\n\nHecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash ([[Corey McPherson Nash]], Boston), overseen by Goodman and Seibert (Fred/Alan, Inc., New York).<ref>[http://fredalan.org/post/69174412/the-nickelodeon-logo-designed-by-tom-corey-scott The Nickelodeon Logo, The Fred/Alan Archive]</ref> The award was configured into the current blimp shape/kaleidoscope in 1990.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKSwMA27KQ|title=Nick Extra - The Making of the KCA Blimp (VOD)|medium=Video|publisher=gamerguy624|date=January 18, 2019|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> The only change to the award since then has been a change to the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for 2010 to fit the network's new logo typeface.\n\nAs the [[Internet]] came into widespread use, the voting eventually moved from a combination of [[900 number]] telephone voting and filling paper ballots that were either mailed or completed at [[Pizza Hut]] locations, to being conducted exclusively on the [[Nick.com|network's website]], and included [[text messaging]] by 2007. During the early years of Internet voting, there were several problems, including the digital equivalent of ballot [[ballot stuffing]] and adult voting. As a result, a new system was put into place where one vote per Nick.com account is allowed (although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option, which is connected to a phone number only rather than a screen name, by creating an account with a false age, or by having their children vote for a chosen subject instead). In 2010, an [[iPhone]] [[iTunes App Store|application]] and mobile browser voting were also added.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/02/16/actor-comedian-kevin-james-tapped-to-host-nickelodeons-23rd-annual-kids-choice-awards-saturday-march-27-live-from-los-angeles-34587/20100216nickelodeon01/|title=Actor/Comedian Kevin James Tapped to Host Nickelodeon's 23rd Annual Kids' Choice Awards Saturday, March 27 Live from Los Angeles|publisher=[[Nickelodeon]]|via=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=February 16, 2010|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 Kids' Choice Awards featured a new award called \"The Big Green Help Award\" which goes to the celebrity who goes above and beyond to help the Earth. The inaugural award was presented to [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. For the 2010 awards, \"The Big Green Help\" award was renamed \"The Big Help\" award, with [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] winning the first award under the rename.\n\nUnlike traditional awards shows, the Kids' Choice Awards uses other items to announce an award winner rather than a traditional [[envelope]]. The show sometimes uses balloons, T-shirts, models, giant letters, stickers, and even a foot.\n\nVoting became available for Canadians in time for the 2010 ceremony, owing to the inauguration of Nickelodeon's [[Nickelodeon (Canada)|Canadian service]] in November 2009.\n\nIn June 2010, [[Nickelodeon Latin America]] announced a [[Kids' Choice Awards Mexico|Kids' Choice Awards for Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.mundonick.com/concursos/mis_premios_mx/ kicks Choice Awards Mexico 2010]</ref> Other countries with their own Kids' Choice Awards include Brazil, United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia, which are either fully original local productions, or inserted as [[Continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] during their broadcast of the American ceremony.

Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed, as [[Mandy Moore]] first learned in [[2007 Kids' Choice Awards|2007]], and [[Halle Berry]] later found out in [[2012 Kids' Choice Awards|2012]]. \n\nAlthough Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the [[1988 Kids' Choice Awards|1988 Awards]], a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president [[Geraldine Laybourne]] saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original ''[[You Can't Do That on Television#Slime|YCDTOTV]]'' recipe, much to her dismay, proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR80XlnRKmQ|title=GET SLIMED - A Message From Our President - NICK at NITE|medium=Video|publisher=DTOWNXX|date=July 1, 2013|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> \n\nBelow is a list of all the celebrities that have been slimed over the past years at the Kids' Choice Awards. \n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Year\n!

Depending on the outcome of the stunt, a certain amount of green slime was added to a slime vat backstage which was referred to throughout as the \"Slime Meter\". The slime was used later on at the end of the show, in what was supposedly the \"World's Longest Celebrity Sliming,\" in which [[Orlando Bloom]] joined host [[Jack Black]] to be slimed for one solid minute. Host Black even made a remark about how the grand total of 27 tons of slime could fit in a vat that only held 25 tons.\n|-\n| [[Akon]]\n| In the first stunt, affectionately called the \"Slime-o-Lition Derby\", the pop star had 45 seconds to ride the Kids' Choice Bobble Head Kart. The choices were the shark-themed \"[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] Jalopy\", a [[hot dog]]-shaped \"Weiner Wagon\" and the winner, the Jack Black Bobble Head Kart which was essentially a go-kart with a giant Jack Black head on the top. Akon successfully completed the course adding 10 tons of slime to the vat, \"plus 5 for finishing\" bringing the total to 15 tons.\n|-\n| [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]\n| The famous R&B singer performed the second stunt manning a \"slime hose,\" firing at a [[sumo wrestling|sumo wrestler]] and propelling him in costume along a long platform. The amount of slime added to the vat was determined by how far the \"human target\" was propelled by the spray of slime. Viewers voting online picked the sumo wrestler over his competitor, the [[Scuba diver]]. The \"human target\" was launched all the way to the 5-ton mark bringing the total of slime in the vat to 20 tons.\n|-\n| [[Heidi Klum]]\n| The last stunt was performed by the supermodel or as host Black called her \"Heidi the Human Dart\". Klum was attached by a harness to a long cable, allowing her to swing freely in which she did. Armed with a pad of spikes, she swung between her platform and what was a trampoline-like wall covered in slime balloons. For every slime balloon Klum popped in 30 seconds, one more ton of slime was added to the vat. Kids voted online to determine exactly what type of spike pad Klum would use to pop the balloons. The choices were the hand-worn \"mittens\" and the winner the \"butt pad\" which unanimously beat out the mittens. Klum popped 7 balloons on the wall, adding 7 more tons of slime to the vat and bringing the total of slime in the vat to 27 tons.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2009\n| [[Will Ferrell]]\n| The comedian-actor slid down a slime-covered slide that was placed on top of Janss Steps on the UCLA campus, on a luge head first into a pool of slime.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2010\n| [[Apolo Anton Ohno]]\n| Two stunts were featured at the 2010 awards. First, eight-time [[2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic]] medalist Ohno was catapulted into slime by sling shot with the help of [[WWE]] wrestler [[John Cena]].\n|-\n| [[Jerry Trainor]]<br />[[Jackson Rathbone]]<br />[[Nicola Peltz]]\n| For the second stunt, to promote ''[[The Last Airbender]]'' stars Peltz and Rathbone along with ''[[iCarly]]'' star Trainor were featured in a bending-slime event. Since Peltz's character is a \"water-bender\", she bent the slime towards Trainor and Rathbone.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2011\n| Kelvin Ramer<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Best of the Kids' Choice Awards|series=Kids' Choice Awards|airdate=March 22, 2020|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref>\n| Ramer's monster truck, rebodied and relivered for the event, jumps over a 50-foot Nickelodeon blimp award into a pool of slime. It was hosted by [[Big Show (wrestler)|Paul \"The Big Show\" Wight]] who said that it was the most dangerous Kids' Choice slime stunt ever.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2012\n| [[Big Show]] and [[The Miz]]\n| A slime themed wrestling match between [[Big Show]] and [[The Miz]]. When either The Big Show or The Miz hits the special cannons on each corner of the ring, slime shoots out and covers the audience. The Big Show defeated The Miz when he threw him over the ring and into a pool of slime. Afterwards, The Big Show was slimed for his ultimate reward.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2014\n| [[Dave England]] & [[Jukka Hilden]]\n| Kids got to pick between three slime stunts and the one with the highest number of votes would win. It was between an Ultimate Slime Rodeo, a High Speed Bathtub Race, or a Slippery Obstacle Course. The Ultimate Slime Rodeo won as both Dave and Jukka rode on electronic riding horses that had slime hoses in their mouths and whoever held on the longest would win. Dave eventually held on the longest and won.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2015\n| Cast of ''[[The Thundermans]]''\n| An online vote was held during the show, in which kids chose between ''[[The Thundermans]]'', ''[[Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn]]'', and ''[[Bella and the Bulldogs]]''.

They had to choose between [[YouTuber]] Bethany Mota and YouTuber, [[Vine (service)|Vine]] star, [[TikTok]] star, and [[Netflix]] actor Cameron Dallas. Both of them went on to partake in the Slime Soakers stunt but only one of them was to get slimed, which the kids had to vote for on [[Nick.com]] and in the Nick app. Towards the end of the show, the winner, Cameron Dallas, was revealed and proceeded to get slimed.\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.kidschoiceawards.com/ Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards \u2013 Official Site]\n* {{IMDb title|1212906|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards}}\n* {{tv.com show|nickelodeons-kids-choice-awards|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards}}\n\n{{Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards}}\n{{Animation industry in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards| ]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:American annual television specials]]\n[[Category:American television awards]]\n[[Category:Awards established in 1988]]\n[[Category:Nickelodeon shows|Kids' Choice Awards]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|Annual American children's awards ceremony show}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2014}}\n{{Infobox award\n| name           = Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\n|current_awards  = 2020 Kids' Choice Awards\n| image          = Jonas Brothers KCA.jpg\n| imagesize      = 250px\n| caption        = [[Jonas Brothers]] performing at the [[2009 Kids' Choice Awards|2009 show]]\n| country        = United States\n| reward         = KCA Blimp\n| presenter      = Nickelodeon\n| year           = {{start date and age|1988|4|18}} \n| year2          = \n| website        = http://kidschoiceawards.com\n| network        = [[Nickelodeon]]\n| runtime        = Approx. 90\u2013120 min. including commercials\n| previous       = '''''[[The Big Ballot]]'''''\n}}\n\nThe '''Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards''' (also known as the '''KCAs''' or ''' Kids' Choice''') is an annual American children's [[awards ceremony]] show that is produced by [[Nickelodeon]]. Usually held on a Saturday night in late March or early April, the show honors the year's biggest [[television]], [[movie]], and [[music]] acts as voted by viewers worldwide of [[Nickelodeon]] networks. Winners receive a hollow orange [[blimp]] figurine, a logo outline for much of the network's 1984\u20132009 era, which also functions as a [[kaleidoscope]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/kids-17366-awards-says.html|title=Kids' Choice Awards grow up; The Nickelodeon celebration of burps and slime has become a star-studded affair.|last=Larsen|first=Peter|date=March 30, 2007|work=[[Orange County Register]]|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}</ref> \n\nThe show features numerous [[celebrity]] guests and musical acts. Since 2002, [[Slime (toy)|slime]] stunts have been incorporated into the show. The KCAs also host live entertainment. It has also been known to overwhelmingly cover people with the network's trademark [[Green slime (You Can't Do That on Television)|green slime]]. The series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' has won the most KCA awards, with sixteen overall through the series' run. Individually, [[Selena Gomez]] has won the most trophies with eleven, followed by [[Will Smith]] (10) and [[Adam Sandler]] (9). [[Whoopi Goldberg]] is the only person to have won a Kids' Choice Award, along with the mainstream \"[[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]\" combination of an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and [[Tony Award|Tony]]. [[Rosie O'Donnell]] has hosted the show most times (8), followed by [[Jack Black]] (3), and [[John Cena]] (2).\n\n==History==\n[[Alan Goodman]], [[Albie Hecht]], and [[Fred Seibert]] created the awards show after Nickelodeon produced a show called ''[[The Big Ballot]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Nickelodeon lowering the voting age|date=March 8, 1987|first=|last=|newspaper=Atlanta Journal; Atlanta Constitution |page=T/30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kids Vote for 'Karate Kid II'|date=March 28, 1987|first=|last=|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kids Like Cos|date=April 6, 1987|first=Virginia|last=Painter|newspaper=USA Today |page=01.D}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Stamberg Never Rests on Sunday|date=April 7, 1987|first=|last=|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News |page=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Monkee Business|date=April 13, 1987|first=Tracey|last=Wong Briggs|newspaper=USA Today|page=01.D}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oASjjJbT6Xg|title=Nickelodeon's Big Ballot|medium=Video|publisher=retrorocker|date=April 18, 2012|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> in 1987, named for the ballots kids voted with. To vote, the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show, the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a thank you video that would be shown during the program. Goodman, Hecht, and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger, more exciting platform.\n\nHecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash ([[Corey McPherson Nash]], Boston), overseen by Goodman and Seibert (Fred/Alan, Inc., New York).<ref>[http://fredalan.org/post/69174412/the-nickelodeon-logo-designed-by-tom-corey-scott The Nickelodeon Logo, The Fred/Alan Archive]</ref> The award was configured into the current blimp shape/kaleidoscope in 1990.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKSwMA27KQ|title=Nick Extra - The Making of the KCA Blimp (VOD)|medium=Video|publisher=gamerguy624|date=January 18, 2019|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> The only change to the award since then has been a change to the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for 2010 to fit the network's new logo typeface.\n\nAs the [[Internet]] came into widespread use, the voting eventually moved from a combination of [[900 number]] telephone voting and filling paper ballots that were either mailed or completed at [[Pizza Hut]] locations, to being conducted exclusively on the [[Nick.com|network's website]], and included [[text messaging]] by 2007. During the early years of Internet voting, there were several problems, including the digital equivalent of ballot [[ballot stuffing]] and adult voting. As a result, a new system was put into place where one vote per Nick.com account is allowed (although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option, which is connected to a phone number only rather than a screen name, by creating an account with a false age, or by having their children vote for a chosen subject instead). In 2010, an [[iPhone]] [[iTunes App Store|application]] and mobile browser voting were also added.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/02/16/actor-comedian-kevin-james-tapped-to-host-nickelodeons-23rd-annual-kids-choice-awards-saturday-march-27-live-from-los-angeles-34587/20100216nickelodeon01/|title=Actor/Comedian Kevin James Tapped to Host Nickelodeon's 23rd Annual Kids' Choice Awards Saturday, March 27 Live from Los Angeles|publisher=[[Nickelodeon]]|via=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=February 16, 2010|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 Kids' Choice Awards featured a new award called \"The Big Green Help Award\" which goes to the celebrity who goes above and beyond to help the Earth. The inaugural award was presented to [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. For the 2010 awards, \"The Big Green Help\" award was renamed \"The Big Help\" award, with [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] winning the first award under the rename.\n\nUnlike traditional awards shows, the Kids' Choice Awards uses other items to announce an award winner rather than a traditional [[envelope]]. The show sometimes uses balloons, T-shirts, models, giant letters, stickers, and even a foot.\n\nVoting became available for Canadians in time for the 2010 ceremony, owing to the inauguration of Nickelodeon's [[Nickelodeon (Canada)|Canadian service]] in November 2009.\n\nIn June 2010, [[Nickelodeon Latin America]] announced a [[Kids' Choice Awards Mexico|Kids' Choice Awards for Mexico]].<ref>[http://www.mundonick.com/concursos/mis_premios_mx/ kicks Choice Awards Mexico 2010]</ref> Other countries with their own Kids' Choice Awards include Brazil, United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia, which are either fully original local productions, or inserted as [[Continuity (broadcasting)|continuity]] during their broadcast of the American ceremony.

Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed, as [[Mandy Moore]] first learned in [[2007 Kids' Choice Awards|2007]], and [[Halle Berry]] later found out in [[2012 Kids' Choice Awards|2012]]. \n\nAlthough Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the [[1988 Kids' Choice Awards|1988 Awards]], a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president [[Geraldine Laybourne]] saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original ''[[You Can't Do That on Television#Slime|YCDTOTV]]'' recipe, much to her dismay, proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR80XlnRKmQ|title=GET SLIMED - A Message From Our President - NICK at NITE|medium=Video|publisher=DTOWNXX|date=July 1, 2013|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref> \n\nBelow is a list of all the celebrities that have been slimed over the past years at the Kids' Choice Awards. \n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Year\n!

Depending on the outcome of the stunt, a certain amount of green slime was added to a slime vat backstage which was referred to throughout as the \"Slime Meter\". The slime was used later on at the end of the show, in what was supposedly the \"World's Longest Celebrity Sliming,\" in which [[Orlando Bloom]] joined host [[Jack Black]] to be slimed for one solid minute. Host Black even made a remark about how the grand total of 27 tons of slime could fit in a vat that only held 25 tons.\n|-\n| [[Akon]]\n| In the first stunt, affectionately called the \"Slime-o-Lition Derby\", the pop star had 45 seconds to ride the Kids' Choice Bobble Head Kart. The choices were the shark-themed \"[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] Jalopy\", a [[hot dog]]-shaped \"Weiner Wagon\" and the winner, the Jack Black Bobble Head Kart which was essentially a go-kart with a giant Jack Black head on the top. Akon successfully completed the course adding 10 tons of slime to the vat, \"plus 5 for finishing\" bringing the total to 15 tons.\n|-\n| [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]\n| The famous R&B singer performed the second stunt manning a \"slime hose,\" firing at a [[sumo wrestling|sumo wrestler]] and propelling him in costume along a long platform. The amount of slime added to the vat was determined by how far the \"human target\" was propelled by the spray of slime. Viewers voting online picked the sumo wrestler over his competitor, the [[Scuba diver]]. The \"human target\" was launched all the way to the 5-ton mark bringing the total of slime in the vat to 20 tons.\n|-\n| [[Heidi Klum]]\n| The last stunt was performed by the supermodel or as host Black called her \"Heidi the Human Dart\". Klum was attached by a harness to a long cable, allowing her to swing freely in which she did. Armed with a pad of spikes, she swung between her platform and what was a trampoline-like wall covered in slime balloons. For every slime balloon Klum popped in 30 seconds, one more ton of slime was added to the vat. Kids voted online to determine exactly what type of spike pad Klum would use to pop the balloons. The choices were the hand-worn \"mittens\" and the winner the \"butt pad\" which unanimously beat out the mittens. Klum popped 7 balloons on the wall, adding 7 more tons of slime to the vat and bringing the total of slime in the vat to 27 tons.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2009\n| [[Will Ferrell]]\n| The comedian-actor slid down a slime-covered slide that was placed on top of Janss Steps on the UCLA campus, on a luge head first into a pool of slime.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2010\n| [[Apolo Anton Ohno]]\n| Two stunts were featured at the 2010 awards. First, eight-time [[2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic]] medalist Ohno was catapulted into slime by sling shot with the help of [[WWE]] wrestler [[John Cena]].\n|-\n| [[Jerry Trainor]]<br />[[Jackson Rathbone]]<br />[[Nicola Peltz]]\n| For the second stunt, to promote ''[[The Last Airbender]]'' stars Peltz and Rathbone along with ''[[iCarly]]'' star Trainor were featured in a bending-slime event. Since Peltz's character is a \"water-bender\", she bent the slime towards Trainor and Rathbone.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2011\n| Kelvin Ramer<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Best of the Kids' Choice Awards|series=Kids' Choice Awards|airdate=March 22, 2020|network=[[Nickelodeon]]}}</ref>\n| Ramer's monster truck, rebodied and relivered for the event, jumps over a 50-foot Nickelodeon blimp award into a pool of slime. It was hosted by [[Big Show (wrestler)|Paul \"The Big Show\" Wight]] who said that it was the most dangerous Kids' Choice slime stunt ever.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2012\n| [[Big Show]] and [[The Miz]]\n| A slime themed wrestling match between [[Big Show]] and [[The Miz]]. When either The Big Show or The Miz hits the special cannons on each corner of the ring, slime shoots out and covers the audience. The Big Show defeated The Miz when he threw him over the ring and into a pool of slime. Afterwards, The Big Show was slimed for his ultimate reward.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2014\n| [[Dave England]] & [[Jukka Hilden]]\n| Kids got to pick between three slime stunts and the one with the highest number of votes would win. It was between an Ultimate Slime Rodeo, a High Speed Bathtub Race, or a Slippery Obstacle Course. The Ultimate Slime Rodeo won as both Dave and Jukka rode on electronic riding horses that had slime hoses in their mouths and whoever held on the longest would win. Dave eventually held on the longest and won.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2015\n| Cast of ''[[The Thundermans]]''\n| An online vote was held during the show, in which kids chose between ''[[The Thundermans]]'', ''[[Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn]]'', and ''[[Bella and the Bulldogs]]''.

She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM and is best remembered for her portrayal of [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Gene Kelly]] and regularly collaborated with director and second husband [[Vincente Minnelli]]. Other notable film appearances during this period include roles in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946), ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), and ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950). Garland was released from MGM in 1950, after 15 years with the studio, amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract.\n\nAlthough her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed performances came later in her career: she received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954) and a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released [[Judy Garland discography#Studio albums|eight studio albums]], and hosted her own [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated television series, ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' (1963\u20131964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], and in 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] placed her among the 10 [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars]] of classic [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx| title= Stars| publisher= American Film Institute| website= AFI.com}}</ref>\n\nGarland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from the time she was a teenager; her self-image was influenced and constantly criticized by film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive and who manipulated her onscreen physical appearance.<ref name= Petersen>{{cite book |author1=Petersen, Anne H. |authorlink1=Anne Helen Petersen |title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood |date=2014 |publisher=Plume (Penguin) |location=New York |isbn=978-0142180679 |pages=157\u201378 [164, 166\u201369] |chapter=10.

They appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|pp=29\u201330}} Through the Meglin Kiddies, they made their film debut in a short subject called ''The Big Revue'' (1929), where they performed a song-and-dance number called \"That's the Good Old Sunny South\". This was followed by appearances in two [[Vitaphone]] shorts the following year: ''A Holiday in Storyland'' (featuring Garland's first on-screen solo) and ''The Wedding of Jack and Jill''. They next appeared together in ''Bubbles''.

One is that it was originated by Jessel after [[Carole Lombard]]'s character Lily Garland in the film ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1934), which was then playing at the [[Nederlander Theatre (Chicago)|Oriental]] in Chicago; another is that the girls chose the surname after drama critic Robert Garland.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Judy: Beyond the Rainbow|series=Biography|serieslink=Biography (TV series)|airdate=January 1, 1999}}</ref> Garland's daughter [[Lorna Luft]] stated that her mother selected the name when Jessel announced that the trio \"looked prettier than a garland of flowers\".{{sfn|Luft|1999|p=26}} A TV special was filmed in Hollywood at the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]] premiere of ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' on September 29, 1954, in which Jessel stated:\n\n{{Quote|I think that I ought to tell the folks that it was I who named Judy Garland, Judy Garland.

A few days later, Judy and her father were brought for an impromptu audition at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]]. Garland performed \"[[Zing!

She was only {{convert|4|ft|11.5|in|cm}}, and her \"cute\" or \"[[girl-next-door]]\" looks did not exemplify the most glamorous persona then required of leading female performers. She was self-conscious and anxious about her appearance. \"Judy went to school at Metro with [[Ava Gardner]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], real beauties\", said [[Charles Walters]], who directed her in a number of films. \"Judy was the big money-maker at the time, a big success, but she was the [[The Ugly Duckling|ugly duckling]]&nbsp;... I think it had a very damaging effect on her emotionally for a long time. I think it lasted forever, really.\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Judy: Impressions of Garland |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0813809 |series=Omnibus |airdate=1972}}</ref> Her insecurity was exacerbated by the attitude of studio chief Louis B.

After reviewing the additions to her look, Garland was surprised when Ponedel said that the caps and discs that Garland had been using were not needed, as she was \u201ca pretty girl.\u201d Ponedel went forward with being Garland's makeup artist. The work that Ponedel did on Garland for ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' made Garland so happy that Ponedel became Garland's go-to every time she worked on a film under MGM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/288816%7C0/Behind-the-Camera-Meet-Me-in-St-Louis.html|title=Behind the Camera \u2013 Meet Me in St. Louis|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>\n\nOn November 16, 1935, thirteen-year-old Garland was in the midst of preparing for a radio performance on the ''[[Shell Chateau|Shell Chateau Hour]]'' when she learned that her father had been hospitalized with [[meningitis]] and had taken a turn for the worse. Frank Gumm died the following morning at age forty-nine, leaving her devastated. Her song for the ''Shell Chateau Hour'' was her first professional rendition of \"Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart\", a song which became a standard in many of her concerts.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=58}}\n\nGarland performed at various studio functions and was eventually cast opposite [[Deanna Durbin]] in the musical-short ''[[Every Sunday]]'' (1936). The film contrasted her vocal range and swing style with Durbin's operatic soprano and served as an extended screen test for them, as studio executives were questioning the wisdom of having two girl singers on the roster.{{sfn|Clarke|2001|p=73}}\n\nGarland came to the attention of studio executives when she sang a special arrangement of \"[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)]]\" to [[Clark Gable]] at a birthday party that the studio arranged for the actor.

She later resented the hectic schedule and believed MGM stole her youth. Rooney, however, denied their studio was responsible for her addiction: \"Judy Garland was never given any drugs by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Mr. Mayer didn't sanction anything for Judy.

Although producers [[Arthur Freed]] and [[Mervyn LeRoy]] had wanted to cast her in the role from the beginning, studio chief Mayer first tried to borrow [[Shirley Temple]] from [[20th Century Fox]], but they declined. [[Deanna Durbin]] was then asked, but was unavailable; this resulted in Garland being cast.{{sfn|Juneau|1974|p=37}}\n\nGarland was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming.

She was given the \"glamor treatment\" in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'' (1943), in which she was dressed in \"grown-up\" gowns. Her lightened hair was also pulled up in a stylish fashion. However, no matter how glamorous or beautiful she appeared on screen or in photographs, she was never confident in her appearance and never escaped the \"girl-next-door\" image that the studio had created for her.{{sfn|Frank|1975|p=175}}\n\nOne of Garland's most successful films for MGM was ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), in which she introduced three standards: \"[[The Trolley Song]]\", \"[[The Boy Next Door (song)|The Boy Next Door]]\", and \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\". This was one of the first films in her career that gave her the opportunity to be the attractive leading lady. [[Vincente Minnelli]] was assigned to direct, and he requested that make-up artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland. Ponedel refined her appearance in several ways, including extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs and dental caps.

The main reasons for its failure were not only its cost, but also the increasing expense of the shooting delays while Garland was ill, as well as because the general public was not yet willing to accept her in a sophisticated film. Following her work on ''The Pirate'', she co-starred for the first and only time with [[Fred Astaire]] (who replaced Gene Kelly after Kelly had broken his ankle) in ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), which became her top-grossing film at MGM.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n[[File:TillTheClouds3.jpg|thumb|Garland in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\n\nThrilled by the huge box-office receipts of ''Easter Parade'', MGM immediately teamed Garland and Astaire in ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]''. During the initial filming, Garland was taking [[Medical prescription|prescription]] barbiturate sleeping pills along with illicitly obtained pills containing [[morphine]]. Around this time, she also developed a serious problem with alcohol. These, in combination with [[migraine]] headaches, led her to miss several shooting days in a row. After being advised by her doctor that she would only be able to work in four- to five-day increments with extended rest periods between, MGM executive [[Arthur Freed]] made the decision to suspend her on July 18, 1948. She was replaced in the film by [[Ginger Rogers]].{{sfn|Shipman|1992|p=225}} When her suspension was over, she was summoned back to work and ultimately performed two songs as a guest in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] biopic ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948), which was her last appearance with Mickey Rooney. Despite the all-star cast, ''Words and Music'' barely broke even at the box office. Having regained her strength, as well as some needed weight during her suspension, Garland felt much better and in the fall of 1948, she returned to MGM to replace a pregnant [[June Allyson]] for the musical film ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949) co-starring [[Van Johnson]]. Although she was sometimes late arriving at the studio during the making of this picture, she managed to complete it five days ahead of schedule. Her daughter Liza made her film debut at the age of two and a half at the end of the film. ''In The Good Old Summertime'' was enormously successful at the box office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Gerald|title=Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland|url=https://archive.org/details/gethappylifeofju00clar|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Random House|page=[https://archive.org/details/gethappylifeofju00clar/page/240 240]}}</ref>\n\nGarland was then cast in the film adaptation of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' in the title role of [[Annie Oakley]]. She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with [[Ethel Merman]], anxious about appearing in an unglamorous part after breaking from juvenile parts for several years, and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director [[Busby Berkeley]]. Berkeley was staging all the musical numbers, and was severe with Garland's lack of effort, attitude, and enthusiasm. She complained to Mayer, trying to have Berkeley fired from the feature.

The film took six months to complete. To lose weight, Garland went back on the pills and the familiar pattern resurfaced. She began showing up late or not at all. When principal photography on ''Summer Stock'' was completed in the spring of 1950, it was decided that Garland needed an additional musical number. She agreed to do it provided the song should be \"[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]\". In addition, she insisted that director [[Charles Walters]] choreograph and stage the number. By that time, Garland had lost 15&nbsp;pounds and looked more slender. \"Get Happy\" was the last segment of ''Summer Stock'' to be filmed. It was her final picture for MGM. When it was released in the fall of 1950, ''Summer Stock'' drew big crowds and racked up very respectable box-office receipts, but because of the costly shooting delays caused by Garland, the film posted a loss of $80,000 to the studio.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nGarland was cast in the film ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' with Fred Astaire after June Allyson became pregnant in 1950.

The relationship began in 1963 while Garland was doing her television show. Ford would attend tapings of the show sitting in the front row while Garland sang. Ford is credited with giving Garland one of the more stable relationships of her later life. The affair was ended by Ford (a notorious womanizer according to his son Peter) when he realized Garland wanted to marry him.<ref> Ford, Peter. Glenn Ford: A Life (Wisconsin Film Studies).

Garland was released from MGM in 1950, after 15 years with the studio, amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract.\n\nAlthough her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed performances came later in her career: she received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954) and a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released [[Judy Garland discography#Studio albums|eight studio albums]], and hosted her own [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated television series, ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'' (1963\u20131964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], and in 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] placed her among the 10 [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars]] of classic [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx| title= Stars| publisher= American Film Institute| website= AFI.com}}</ref>\n\nGarland struggled in her personal life from an early age.

She was replaced in the film by [[Ginger Rogers]].{{sfn|Shipman|1992|p=225}} When her suspension was over, she was summoned back to work and ultimately performed two songs as a guest in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] biopic ''[[Words and Music (1948 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1948), which was her last appearance with Mickey Rooney. Despite the all-star cast, ''Words and Music'' barely broke even at the box office. Having regained her strength, as well as some needed weight during her suspension, Garland felt much better and in the fall of 1948, she returned to MGM to replace a pregnant [[June Allyson]] for the musical film ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949) co-starring [[Van Johnson]]. Although she was sometimes late arriving at the studio during the making of this picture, she managed to complete it five days ahead of schedule. Her daughter Liza made her film debut at the age of two and a half at the end of the film. ''In The Good Old Summertime'' was enormously successful at the box office.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Gerald|title=Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland|url=https://archive.org/details/gethappylifeofju00clar|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Random House|page=[https://archive.org/details/gethappylifeofju00clar/page/240 240]}}</ref>\n\nGarland was then cast in the film adaptation of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' in the title role of [[Annie Oakley]]. She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with [[Ethel Merman]], anxious about appearing in an unglamorous part after breaking from juvenile parts for several years, and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director [[Busby Berkeley]]. Berkeley was staging all the musical numbers, and was severe with Garland's lack of effort, attitude, and enthusiasm. She complained to Mayer, trying to have Berkeley fired from the feature. She began arriving late to the set and sometimes failed to appear.

The film took six months to complete. To lose weight, Garland went back on the pills and the familiar pattern resurfaced. She began showing up late or not at all. When principal photography on ''Summer Stock'' was completed in the spring of 1950, it was decided that Garland needed an additional musical number. She agreed to do it provided the song should be \"[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]\". In addition, she insisted that director [[Charles Walters]] choreograph and stage the number. By that time, Garland had lost 15&nbsp;pounds and looked more slender. \"Get Happy\" was the last segment of ''Summer Stock'' to be filmed. It was her final picture for MGM. When it was released in the fall of 1950, ''Summer Stock'' drew big crowds and racked up very respectable box-office receipts, but because of the costly shooting delays caused by Garland, the film posted a loss of $80,000 to the studio.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nGarland was cast in the film ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' with Fred Astaire after June Allyson became pregnant in 1950.

After its first-run engagements, about 30 minutes of footage were cut, sparking outrage among critics and filmgoers. Although it was still popular, drawing huge crowds and grossing over $6,000,000 in its first release, ''A Star is Born'' did not make back its cost and ended up losing money.

Royce believes that fans and audiences insisted on preserving their memory of Garland as Dorothy no matter how much she matured, calling her \"a captive not of her own desire to stay young, but a captive of the public's desire to preserve her that way\".<ref name=\":11\" /> Thus, the studio continued to cast Garland in roles that were significantly younger than her actual age.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to Malony, Garland was one of Hollywood's hardest-working performers during the 1940s, which Malony claims she used as a [[Coping (psychology)|coping mechanism]] after her first marriage imploded.<ref name=\":10\" /> However, studio employees recall that Garland had a tendency to be quite intense, headstrong and volatile;<ref name=\":4\" /> ''Judy Garland: The Secret Life of an American Legend'' author [[David Shipman (writer)|David Shipman]] claims that several individuals were frustrated by Garland's \"[[narcissism]]\" and \"growing instability\", while millions of fans found her public demeanor and [[psychological state]] to be \"fragile\",<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> appearing neurotic in interviews.<ref name=\":11\" /> MGM reports that Garland was consistently tardy and demonstrated erratic behavior, which resulted in several delays and disruptions to filming schedules until she was finally dismissed from the studio, which had deemed her unreliable and difficult to manage.<ref name=\":10\" /> Farrell called Garland \"A grab bag of contradictions\" which \"has always been a feast for the American imagination\", describing her public persona as \"awkward yet direct, bashful yet brash\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Describing the singer as \"Tender and endearing yet savage and turbulent\", Paglia wrote that Garland \"cut a path of destruction through many lives. And out of that chaos, she made art of still-searing intensity.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> Calling her \"a creature of extremes, greedy, sensual, and demanding, gluttonous for pleasure and pain\",<ref name=\":4\" /> Paglia also compared Garland to entertainer [[Frank Sinatra]] due to their shared \"emblematic personality ... into whom the mass audience projected its hopes and disappointments\", while observing that she lacked Sinatra's survival skills.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nDespite her success as a performer, Garland suffered from low self-esteem, particularly with regard to her weight, which she constantly dieted to maintain at the behest of the studio and Mayer;<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> critics and historians believe this was a result of having been told that she was an \"[[The Ugly Duckling|ugly duckling]]\" by studio executives.<ref name=\":9\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' columnist [[Gene Lyons]] observed that both audiences and fellow members of the entertainment industry \"tended either to love her or to hate her\".<ref name=\":6\" /> At one point, Stevie Phillips, who had worked as an agent for Garland for four years, described her client as \"a demented, demanding, supremely talented drug-addict\".<ref name=\":10\" /> Royce argues that Garland maintained \"astonishing strength and courage\", even during difficult times.<ref name=\":11\" /> English actor [[Dirk Bogarde]] once called Garland \"the funniest woman I have ever met\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Ruhlmann wrote that the singer's personal life \"contrasted so starkly with the exuberance and innocence of her film roles\".<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nDespite her personal struggles, Garland disagreed with the public's opinion that she was a tragic figure.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":8\" /> Her younger daughter Lorna agreed that Garland \"hated\" being referred to as a tragic figure, explaining, \"We all have tragedies in our lives, but that does not make us tragic. She was funny and she was warm and she was wonderfully gifted. She had great highs and great moments in her career. She also had great moments in her personal life. Yes, we lost her at 47 years old.

He attended primary school in Ple\u015fcoi, a village near his home, for a year, after which he was sent to a [[boarding school]] in [[Buz\u0103u]]. He attended high school in Buz\u0103u, then in [[Bucharest]] &mdash; the [[Gheorghe Laz\u0103r National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Laz\u0103r High School]], where he befriended [[George Ciprian]], an aspiring actor at that time, and the young writer [[Urmuz]].\n\nUpon graduating high school in 1902, he read [[Philosophy]] for a year at the [[University of Bucharest]] before starting his medical studies at the Faculty of [[Medicine]]. He became a [[Physician|doctor of medicine]] in 1910.\n\n===Prominence===\nMarch 1912 marked Voiculescu's debut as a poet with ''Dor'' (\"Longing\"), a poem first published in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''. He managed to publish a volume of poems in 1916, but the [[German Empire]] forces occupying Bucharest (''see [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)]]'') destroyed all copies. In 1918, he published the volume ''Din \u0163ara zimbrului'' (\"From the Land of the Wisent\").\n\nBetween the two world wars, he lived in Bucharest and held a series of public conferences on medicine, broadcast on radio and aimed primarily at peasant audiences. He wrote poetry of religious persuasion, themed around the [[Christmas|birth of Christ]], [[Magi]], and [[Crucifixion]]. His literary style gradually became [[Expressionism|Expressionistic]].\n\nVoiculescu published several short stories, such as ''Capul de zimbru'' (\"Wisent Head\"); novels, such as ''Zahei orbul'' (\"Zahei the Blind\"), and plays: ''Duhul p\u0103m\u00e2ntului'' (\"Earth's Ghost\"), ''Demiurgul'' (\"The [[Demiurge]]\"), ''Gimnastic\u0103 sentimental\u0103'' (\"Sentimental Gymnastics\"), ''Pribeaga'' (\"The Wanderer\").\n\n===Imprisonment and release===\nAfter [[World War II]], Romanian [[Communist Romania|communist authorities]] attacked and persecuted Voiculescu for his religious and [[Democracy|democratic]] ideals, and did not allow him to publish. He was imprisoned in 1958, at the age of 74, and he spent the following four years in prison; he became ill during detention, dying of [[cancer]] a few months after his release.\n\nHis final work, ''[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Last Imagined Sonnets in the Imaginary Translation of...'', comprises 90 [[sonnet]]s, written between 1954 and 1958.

This behavior is the source of ''E. saccharina's'' common name, the African sugar-cane borer.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Pupa ===\nPupation is the third stage of moth development during which moths undergo transformation from immature to mature stages. During this time, pupae undergo developmental stages known as instars. Pupae of ''E. saccharina'' can be found tunneled inside host plants. They reside very close, often only 5 centimeters, to the exit hole, which is visible on the plant surface.

After emerging, adult males will set their wings and after 30 minutes will begin to display to females. There, they face downwards and beat their wings rapidly. Males tend to aggregate into groups of 3\u20136 on the same plant to make it easier for females to locate them. This behavior can continue for anywhere between 15\u201320 minutes. During this period, males can either remain stationary or move slightly before restarting the beating. Females, when present, also begin a similar wing flapping behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=P.R.|date=1981-09-01|title=Mating behaviour and activity patterns of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)|url=https://journals.co.za/content/JESSA/44/2/AJA00128789_3791|journal=Journal of the Entomological Society of Southern Africa|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|issn=0013-8789}}</ref> However, this behavior occurs regardless of female presence and releases both an attractant pheromone and an aphrodisiac to entice faraway females.<ref name=\":7\" /> Since the African sugar-cane borer is very sensitive to temperature, male mating behaviors have been found to stop when conditions are below 15 degree Celsius.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Courting ===\nAfrican sugar-cane borer courting has only been documented once in the wild.<ref name=\":7\" /> After encountering a female, a male African sugar-cane borer will face the female with extended antennae. The two will then rotate in a circle with the male following the female, which signals her interest with spread wings. Following the circling, males will then climb onto females and have the tip of their abdomens meet the females. The males will then grip the females' thorax and can copulate for up to three hours. During this time, the pairs will move to lower vegetation as females are particularly vulnerable during copulation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Pheromones ===\nAfrican sugar-cane borer males secrete [[pheromone]]s by wing glands and abdominal [[hair-pencil]]s to attract females.

Pre-trashing involves the preemptive removal of dry or dead leaf material from sugarcane field that do not have existing populations of ''E.saccharina''. Not only does this technique prevent African sugar-cane borers from laying eggs and populating new fields, but also any undetected eggs, already present, would be moved too far from the cane stalk for larvae traverse the distance.

Larvae spread from their hatching site after 1\u20133 days. When they encounter predators, larvae excrete brownish liquid from their mouths, which deters predation.<ref name=\":1\" /> After hatching, larvae feed on external surfaces of plants before tunneling into stems where they [[pupa]]te. This behavior is the source of ''E. saccharina's'' common name, the African sugar-cane borer.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Pupa ===\nPupation is the third stage of moth development during which moths undergo transformation from immature to mature stages. During this time, pupae undergo developmental stages known as instars. Pupae of ''E. saccharina'' can be found tunneled inside host plants. They reside very close, often only 5 centimeters, to the exit hole, which is visible on the plant surface. African sugar-cane borers typically pupate for 7\u201313 days before emerging from the exit hole.<ref name=\":1\" /> While they are tunneled into the plant, pupae are very resistant to human attempts of removal. They can even survive crop burnings.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Adult ===\nAdult African sugar-cane borers emerge from exit holes in their host plants. Adults usually emerge after a rapid drop in temperature, after which they climb vertically and spread their wings.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=P.R.|date=1981-09-01|title=Mating behaviour and activity patterns of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)|url=http://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/JESSA/44/2/3813.pdf?expires=1508020724&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=B5DDF40FE1010FA9D7BEE8E7EB434B03|journal=Journal of the Entomological Society of Southern Africa|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|issn=0013-8789}}</ref> After 10\u201315 minutes of setting their new wings, newly emerged adults only survive for 6\u201313 days, during which females spend two days in pre-oviposition and have a 4-day reproductive life.

In particular ''[[Pheidole megacephala|Pheidole]]'', a species of small ants are well-suited to reaching African sugar-cane borer eggs, which are commonly hidden in tight spaces behind leaf sheaths.

After emerging, adult males will set their wings and after 30 minutes will begin to display to females. There, they face downwards and beat their wings rapidly. Males tend to aggregate into groups of 3\u20136 on the same plant to make it easier for females to locate them. This behavior can continue for anywhere between 15\u201320 minutes. During this period, males can either remain stationary or move slightly before restarting the beating. Females, when present, also begin a similar wing flapping behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Atkinson|first=P.R.|date=1981-09-01|title=Mating behaviour and activity patterns of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)|url=https://journals.co.za/content/JESSA/44/2/AJA00128789_3791|journal=Journal of the Entomological Society of Southern Africa|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|issn=0013-8789}}</ref> However, this behavior occurs regardless of female presence and releases both an attractant pheromone and an aphrodisiac to entice faraway females.<ref name=\":7\" /> Since the African sugar-cane borer is very sensitive to temperature, male mating behaviors have been found to stop when conditions are below 15 degree Celsius.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Courting ===\nAfrican sugar-cane borer courting has only been documented once in the wild.<ref name=\":7\" /> After encountering a female, a male African sugar-cane borer will face the female with extended antennae. The two will then rotate in a circle with the male following the female, which signals her interest with spread wings. Following the circling, males will then climb onto females and have the tip of their abdomens meet the females. The males will then grip the females' thorax and can copulate for up to three hours. During this time, the pairs will move to lower vegetation as females are particularly vulnerable during copulation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Pheromones ===\nAfrican sugar-cane borer males secrete [[pheromone]]s by wing glands and abdominal [[hair-pencil]]s to attract females.

Pre-trashing involves the preemptive removal of dry or dead leaf material from sugarcane field that do not have existing populations of ''E.saccharina''. Not only does this technique prevent African sugar-cane borers from laying eggs and populating new fields, but also any undetected eggs, already present, would be moved too far from the cane stalk for larvae traverse the distance. This technique, however, does have some drawbacks, since pre-trashing does cause irreversible damage to growing plants and reduces crop yield.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carnegie|first=A.J.M.|date=Summer 1982|title=PRE-TRASHING OF SUGARCANE AS A MEANS OF COMBATING THE BORER ELDANA SACCHARINA WALKER|url=http://www.sasta.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Proceedings/1980s/1982_Carnegie_Pre%20Trashing%20Of%20Sugarcane.pdf|journal=The South African Sugar Technologists' Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Intercropping and host plant breeding ====\nA common method to combat ''E. saccharina'' is to [[Intercropping|intercrop]] target plants with non-host plants.

Two parasitic wasps, ''Cotesia flavipes'' and ''Xanthopimpla stemmator'', attack African sugar-cane borer larvae by parasitizing them. When hatched, the larvae of these wasps consume the pest larvae. This method is particularly useful for targeting larvae that have already bored into the host plant and are normally very difficult to reach.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Silicon treatment ====\nIn many plant species, it has been found that applied silicon can enhance a plant species' resistance to pests because it increases silicon deposition in epidermal cells.
