The oldest said that if she married the royal butler, she would give the entire court a drink out of one glass, with water left over.  The second said that if she married the keeper of the royal wardrobe, she would dress the entire court in one piece of cloth, and have some left over.  The [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] said that if she married the king, she would bear two sons with apples in their hands, and a daughter with a star on her forehead.\n\nThe next morning, the king ordered the older two sisters to do as they said, and then married them to the butler and the keeper of the royal wardrobe, and the youngest to himself.  The queen became pregnant, and the king had to go to war, leaving behind news that he was to hear of the birth of his children.  The queen gave birth to the children she had promised, but her sisters, jealous, put three puppies in their place, sent word to the king, and handed over the children to be abandoned.  The king ordered that his wife be put in a [[treadwheel crane]].\n\nThree [[fairy|fairies]] saw the abandoned children and gave them a deer to nurse them, a purse full of money, and a ring that changed color when misfortune befell one of them.  When they were grown, they left for the city and took a house.\n\nTheir aunts saw them and were terror-struck.  They sent their nurse to visit the daughter and tell her that the house needed the Dancing Water to be perfect and her brothers should get it for her.  The oldest son left and found three hermits in turn.  The first two could not help him, but the third told him how to retrieve the Dancing Water, and he brought it back to the house.  On seeing it, the aunts sent their nurse to tell the girl that the house needed the Singing Apple as well, but the brother got it, as he had the Dancing Water.  The [[Rule of three (writing)|third time]], they sent him after the Speaking Bird, but as one of the conditions was that he not respond to the bird, and it told him that his aunts were trying to kill him and his mother was in the treadmill, it shocked him into speech, and he was turned to stone.  The ring changed colors.  His brother came after him, but suffered the same fate.  Their sister came after them both, said nothing, and transformed her brother and many other statues back to life.\n\nThey returned home, and the king saw them and thought that if he did not know his wife had given birth to three puppies, he would think these his children.  They invited him to dinner, and the Speaking Bird told the king all that had happened.  The king executed the aunts and their nurse and took his wife and children back to the palace.\n\n==Overview==\nThe following summary was based on [[Joseph Jacobs]]'s tale reconstruction in his ''Europa's Fairy Book'', on the general analyses made by Arthur Bernard Cook in his ''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion'',<ref>Extracted from Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref> and on the description of the tale-type in the [[Aarne-Thompson|Aarne-Thompson-Uther index]] classification of folk and fairy tales.<ref>''Lesebuchgeschichten: Erz\u00e4hlstoffe in Schulleseb\u00fcchern, 1770-1920''. Ingrid Tomkowiak. Berlin: De Gruyter. 1993. p. 254.</ref> This type follows an almost fixed structure, with very similar characteristics, regardless of their geographic distribution:<ref>Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref>\n\nThe king passes by a house or other place where [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] sisters are gossiping or talking, and the [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] says, if the king married her, she would bear him \"wondrous children\" (their peculiar appearances tend to vary, but they are usually connected with astronomical motifs on some part of their bodies, such as the Sun, the moon or stars). The king overhears their talk and marries the youngest sister, to the envy of the older ones or to the chagrin of the grandmother. As such, the jealous relatives deprive the mother of her newborn children (in some tales, [[Twins|twins]] or [[Triplets|triplets]], or [[Rule of three (writing)|three consecutive births]], but the boy is usually the firstborn, and the girl is the youngest), either by replacing the children with animals or accusing the mother of having devoured them. Their mother is banished from the kingdom or severely punished (imprisoned in the dungeon or in a cage; walled in; buried up to the torso). Meanwhile, the children are either hidden by a servant of the castle (gardener, cook, butcher) or cast into the water, but they are found and brought up at a distance from the father's home by a childless foster family (fisherman, miller, etc.).\n\nYears later, after they reach a certain age, a magical helper (a fairy, or the Virgin Mary in more religious variants) gives them means to survive in the world. Soon enough, the children move next to the palace where the king lives, and either the aunts, or grandmother realize their nephews/grandchildren are alive and send the midwife (or a maid; a witch; a slave) or disguise themselves to tell the sister that her house needs some marvellous items, and incite the girl to convince her brother(s) to embark on the (perilous) quest. The items also tend to vary, but in many versions there are three treasures: (1) water, or some water source (e.g., spring, fountain, sea, stream) with fantastic properties (e.g., a golden fountain, or a rejuvenating liquid); (2) a magical tree (or branch, or bough, or flower, or a fruit - usually apples) with strange powers (e.g., makes music or sings); and (3) a wondrous bird that can tell the truth, knows many languages and/or turns people to stone.<ref>However, Stith Thompson, in his book of Folklore Motifs, indicates that the formula is \"a dancing item, a singing item and the bird\".</ref> \n\nThe brother(s) set(s) off on his (their) journey, but give(s) a token to the sister so she knows the brother(s) is(are) alive. Eventually, the brothers meet a character (a sage, an ogre, etc.) that warns them not to listen to the bird, otherwise he will be petrified (or turned to salt, or to marble pillars). The first brother fails the quest, and so does the next one. The sister, seeing that the tokens changed colour, realizes her siblings are in danger and departs to finish the quest for the wonderful items and rescue her brother(s).\n\nAfterwards, either the siblings invite the king or the king invites the brothers and their sister for a feast in the palace. As per the bird's instructions, the siblings display their etiquette during the meal (in some versions, they make a suggestion to invite the disgraced queen; in others, they give their poisoned meal to some dogs). Then, the bird reveals the whole truth, the children are reunited with their parents, and the jealous relatives are punished.\n\n==Variations==\n\nWhile the formula is almost followed to the letter, some variatons occur in the second part of the story (the quest for the magical items), and even in the conclusion of the tale:\n\n===The Brother Quests for a Bride===\n\nIn some tales, when the sister is lured by the antagonist's agent, she is told to look for the belongings (mirror, flower, handkerchief) of a woman of unearthly beauty or a fairy. Such variants occur in Albania, as in the tales collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn|J. G. Von Hahn]] in his ''Griechische und Albanische M\u00e4rchen'' (Leipzig, 1864), in the village of [[Zagori]] in [[Epirus]],<ref>''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion''. Arthur Bernard Cook. Cambridge University Press. 1925. p. 1006-1007.</ref> and by Auguste Dozon in ''Contes Albanais'' (Paris, 1881). These stories substitute the quest for the items for the search for a fairy named ''[[E Bukura e Dheut]]'' (\"Beauty of the Land\"), a woman of extraordinary beauty and magical powers.<ref>Elsie, Robert (2001).

In this version, it is a king who overhears the sisters' nightly conversation in his search for a wife for his son. At the end, the brother marries the foreign princess and his sister reveals the truth to the court.<ref name=\"autogenerated111\">Seklemian, A. G. ''The Golden Maiden and Other Folk Tales and Fairy Stories Told in Armenia''. New York: The Helmen Taylor Company. 1898. pp. 111-122.</ref>\n\nThis conclusion also happens in an Indian variant, called ''The Boy with the Moon on his Forehead'', from Bengali. In this tale, the [[Rule of Seven|seventh]] queen begets the wonder-children ([[fraternal twins]], a girl and a boy); the antagonists are the other six queens, who, overcome with jealousy, trick the new queen with puppies and expose the children. When they both grow up, the jealous queens set the siblings on a quest for a ''kataki'' flower, with the brother rescuing Lady Pushpavati from [[Rakshasas]]. Lady Pushpavati marries the titular \"boy with the moon on his forehead\" and reveals to the King her mother-in-law's ordeal and the deceit of the King's co-wives.<ref name=\"archive236\">Folk-Tales of Bengal.

Second series. Collected by J\u00f3n \u00c1rnason. Translated by George E. J. Powell and Eirikur Magn\u00fasson.

D'Aulnoy, where the heroine rescues her cousin, Prince Ch\u00e9ri, and marries him. Another French variant, collected by [[Henry Carnoy]] (''L'Arbre qui chante, l'Oiseau qui parle et l'Eau d'or'', or \"The tree that sings, the bird that speaks and the water of gold\"), has the youngest daughter, the princess, marry an enchanted old man she meets in her journey and who gives her advice on how to obtain the items.<ref>Carnoy, Henry. ''Contes fran\u00e7ais''. France, Paris: E. Leroux. 1885. pp. 107-113.</ref>\n\nIn a tale collected in [[Carinthia]] (K\u00e4rnten), Austria (''Die schwarzen und die wei\u00dfen Steine'', or \"The black and white stones\"), the three siblings climb a mountain or slope, but the brothers listen to the sounds of the mountain and are petrified. Their sister arrives at a field of white and black stones and, after a bird gives her instructions, sprinkles magic water on the stones, restoring her brothers and many others - among them, a young man, whom she later marries.<ref>Franzisci, Franz. ''M\u00e4rchen aus K\u00e4rnten: Jugendbuch''. 2006. {{ISBN 978-3-900531-61-4}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] variant ''Th\u00e9odore, le Danseur'', the brother ventures on a quest for the belongings of the eponymous character and, at the conclusion of the tale, this fabled male dancer marries the sister.<ref>Hoogasian-Villa, Susie. ''100 Armenian Tales and Their Folkloristic Relevance''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. 1966. pp. 492.</ref><ref>Drower, E. S. (Ethel Stefana), Lady, b. 1879. Folktales of Iraq. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications. 2006. p. 294.</ref>\n\nA similar conclusion happens in the commedia dell'arte ''[[The Green Bird]]'', where the brother undergoes the quest for the items, and the titular green bird is a cursed prince, who, after being released from its avian form, marries the sister.\n\n===The Tale of Tsar Saltan===\n\nSome versions of the tale have the mother being cast out with the babies into the sea in a box, after the king is tricked into thinking his wife did not deliver her promised wonder children. The box eventually washes ashore on the beaches of an island or another country. There, the child (or children) magically grows up in hours or days and builds an enchanted castle or house that attracts the attention of the common folk (or merchants, or travellers). Word reaches the ears of the despondent king, who hears about the mysterious owners of such fantastic abode, who just happen to look like the children he would have had.\n\nRussian tale collections attest to the presence of [[Baba Yaga]], the witch of [[Slavic folklore]], as the antagonist in many of the stories.<ref>Johns, Andreas. ''Baba Yaga: The Ambiguous Mother and Witch of the Russian Folktale''. New York: Peter Lang. 2010. pp. 244-246. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-6769-6}}</ref>\n\nIn some variants, the castaway boy sets a trap to rescue his brothers and release them from a [[Shapeshifting|transformation curse]]. For example, in ''N\u00e1d P\u00e9ter'' (\"Schilf-Peter\"), a Hungarian variant,<ref>R\u00f3na-Sklarek, Elisabet. ''Ungarische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Neue Folge. Leipzig: Dieterich. 1909. pp. 53-65.</ref> when the hero of the tale sees a flock of eleven swans flying, he recognizes them as their brothers, who have been transformed into birds due to divine intervention by [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and [[St. Peter]].\n\nIn another format, the boy asks his mother to prepare a meal with her \"breast milk\" and prepares to invade his brothers' residence to confirm if they are indeed his siblings. This plot happens in a Finnish variant, from [[Ingermanland]], collected in ''Finnische und Estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen'' (''Bruder und Schwester und die goldlockigen K\u00f6nigss\u00f6hne'', or \"Brother and Sister, and the golden-haired sons of the King\").<ref>L\u00f6wis of Menar, August von. ''Finnische und estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Jena: Eugen Diederichs. 1922. pp. 53-59.</ref> The mother gives birth to six sons with special traits who are sold to a devil by the old midwife. Some time later, their youngest brother enters the devil's residence and succeeds in rescuing his siblings.\n\n===The Boys With The Golden Stars===\n\nThe motif of a woman's babies, born with wonderful attributes after she claimed she could bear such children, but stolen from her, is a common fairy tale motif. In this plot-type, an evil stepmother (or grandmother, or gypsy, or slave, or maid) kills the babies, but the twins go through a resurrective reincarnation: from trees to animals and finally into humans babies again. This [[Transformation chase|transformation chase]] where the stepmother is unable to prevent the children's reappearance is unusual, although it appears in \"[[A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers]]\" and in \"The Count's Evil Mother\", a [[Croatia]]n tale from the [[Karlovac]] area.<ref name=\"vrki\u01071997\">{{cite book|last=Vrki\u0107|first= Jozo|authorlink=Jozo Vrki\u0107 |title=Hrvatske bajke|location= Glagol, Zagreb|year= 1997}} The tale first published in written form by Rudolf Strohal.</ref>\n\nMost versions of ''The Boys With Golden Stars'' begin with the birth of male twins, but very rarely there are fraternal twins, a boy and a girl. When they transform into human babies again, the siblings grow up at an impossibly fast rate and hide their supernatural trait under a hood or a cap. Soon after, they show up in their father's court or house to reveal the truth through a riddle or through a ballad.\n\nThis tale's format happens in many variants collected in the [[Balkan]] area, specially in Romenia,<ref name=\"autogenerated121\">''Die goldenen kinder''.

The fairy (or mystical woman) he sought before gives both siblings instructions to summon the being in front of the king, during a banquet.\n\nIn many widespread variants, the bird is replaced by a fairy or magical woman the Brother seeks after as part of the impossible tasks set by his aunts, and whom he later marries (''The Brother Quests for a Bride'' format). Very rarely, it is one of the children themselves that reveal the aunts' treachery to their father, as seen in the [[Armenia|Armenian]] variants ''The Twins'' and ''Theodore, le Danseur''.<ref>Hoogasian-Villa, Susie.

This version of the tale preserves the motif of the wonder-children, which are born \"with golden chains around their necks\", the substitution for animals and the degradation of the mother, but merges with the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}, which is [[Aarne-Thompson]] 451, \"The boys or brothers transformed into birds\".\n\nIn a brief summary:<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/><ref name=Hibbard240-1>{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}</ref> a lord encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace, they marry and she gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers.

In the second part of the tale, the youngest child, a girl, witnesses her brothers' transformation into crows, but she is eventually found and marries a Rajah of a neighboring region. Her child, the prince, learns of his family history and ventures on a quest to reverse his uncles's transformation. At the climax of the story, the boy invites his grandfather and his co-wives and reveals the whole plot, as the family reunites.<ref>Frere, Mary Eliza Isabella.

The oldest said that if she married the royal butler, she would give the entire court a drink out of one glass, with water left over.  The second said that if she married the keeper of the royal wardrobe, she would dress the entire court in one piece of cloth, and have some left over.  The [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] said that if she married the king, she would bear two sons with apples in their hands, and a daughter with a star on her forehead.\n\nThe next morning, the king ordered the older two sisters to do as they said, and then married them to the butler and the keeper of the royal wardrobe, and the youngest to himself.  The queen became pregnant, and the king had to go to war, leaving behind news that he was to hear of the birth of his children.  The queen gave birth to the children she had promised, but her sisters, jealous, put three puppies in their place, sent word to the king, and handed over the children to be abandoned.  The king ordered that his wife be put in a [[treadwheel crane]].\n\nThree [[fairy|fairies]] saw the abandoned children and gave them a deer to nurse them, a purse full of money, and a ring that changed color when misfortune befell one of them.  When they were grown, they left for the city and took a house.\n\nTheir aunts saw them and were terror-struck.  They sent their nurse to visit the daughter and tell her that the house needed the Dancing Water to be perfect and her brothers should get it for her.  The oldest son left and found three hermits in turn.  The first two could not help him, but the third told him how to retrieve the Dancing Water, and he brought it back to the house.  On seeing it, the aunts sent their nurse to tell the girl that the house needed the Singing Apple as well, but the brother got it, as he had the Dancing Water.  The [[Rule of three (writing)|third time]], they sent him after the Speaking Bird, but as one of the conditions was that he not respond to the bird, and it told him that his aunts were trying to kill him and his mother was in the treadmill, it shocked him into speech, and he was turned to stone.  The ring changed colors.  His brother came after him, but suffered the same fate.  Their sister came after them both, said nothing, and transformed her brother and many other statues back to life.\n\nThey returned home, and the king saw them and thought that if he did not know his wife had given birth to three puppies, he would think these his children.  They invited him to dinner, and the Speaking Bird told the king all that had happened.  The king executed the aunts and their nurse and took his wife and children back to the palace.\n\n==Overview==\nThe following summary was based on [[Joseph Jacobs]]'s tale reconstruction in his ''Europa's Fairy Book'', on the general analyses made by Arthur Bernard Cook in his ''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion'',<ref>Extracted from Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref> and on the description of the tale-type in the [[Aarne-Thompson|Aarne-Thompson-Uther index]] classification of folk and fairy tales.<ref>''Lesebuchgeschichten: Erz\u00e4hlstoffe in Schulleseb\u00fcchern, 1770-1920''. Ingrid Tomkowiak. Berlin: De Gruyter. 1993. p. 254.</ref> This type follows an almost fixed structure, with very similar characteristics, regardless of their geographic distribution:<ref>Cook, Arthur Bernard. ''Zeus, A Study In Ancient Religion''. Cambridge University Press. 1925. Vol. II, Part I. Appendix F. pp. 1003-1019.</ref>\n\nThe king passes by a house or other place where [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] sisters are gossiping or talking, and the [[Youngest daughter|youngest]] says, if the king married her, she would bear him \"wondrous children\" (their peculiar appearances tend to vary, but they are usually connected with astronomical motifs on some part of their bodies, such as the Sun, the moon or stars). The king overhears their talk and marries the youngest sister, to the envy of the older ones or to the chagrin of the grandmother. As such, the jealous relatives deprive the mother of her newborn children (in some tales, [[Twins|twins]] or [[Triplets|triplets]], or [[Rule of three (writing)|three consecutive births]], but the boy is usually the firstborn, and the girl is the youngest), either by replacing the children with animals or accusing the mother of having devoured them. Their mother is banished from the kingdom or severely punished (imprisoned in the dungeon or in a cage; walled in; buried up to the torso). Meanwhile, the children are either hidden by a servant of the castle (gardener, cook, butcher) or cast into the water, but they are found and brought up at a distance from the father's home by a childless foster family (fisherman, miller, etc.).\n\nYears later, after they reach a certain age, a magical helper (a fairy, or the Virgin Mary in more religious variants) gives them means to survive in the world. Soon enough, the children move next to the palace where the king lives, and either the aunts, or grandmother realize their nephews/grandchildren are alive and send the midwife (or a maid; a witch; a slave) or disguise themselves to tell the sister that her house needs some marvellous items, and incite the girl to convince her brother(s) to embark on the (perilous) quest. The items also tend to vary, but in many versions there are three treasures: (1) water, or some water source (e.g., spring, fountain, sea, stream) with fantastic properties (e.g., a golden fountain, or a rejuvenating liquid); (2) a magical tree (or branch, or bough, or flower, or a fruit - usually apples) with strange powers (e.g., makes music or sings); and (3) a wondrous bird that can tell the truth, knows many languages and/or turns people to stone.<ref>However, Stith Thompson, in his book of Folklore Motifs, indicates that the formula is \"a dancing item, a singing item and the bird\".</ref> \n\nThe brother(s) set(s) off on his (their) journey, but give(s) a token to the sister so she knows the brother(s) is(are) alive. Eventually, the brothers meet a character (a sage, an ogre, etc.) that warns them not to listen to the bird, otherwise he will be petrified (or turned to salt, or to marble pillars). The first brother fails the quest, and so does the next one. The sister, seeing that the tokens changed colour, realizes her siblings are in danger and departs to finish the quest for the wonderful items and rescue her brother(s).\n\nAfterwards, either the siblings invite the king or the king invites the brothers and their sister for a feast in the palace. As per the bird's instructions, the siblings display their etiquette during the meal (in some versions, they make a suggestion to invite the disgraced queen; in others, they give their poisoned meal to some dogs). Then, the bird reveals the whole truth, the children are reunited with their parents, and the jealous relatives are punished.\n\n==Variations==\n\nWhile the formula is almost followed to the letter, some variatons occur in the second part of the story (the quest for the magical items), and even in the conclusion of the tale:\n\n===The Brother Quests for a Bride===\n\nIn some tales, when the sister is lured by the antagonist's agent, she is told to look for the belongings (mirror, flower, handkerchief) of a woman of unearthly beauty or a fairy. Such variants occur in Albania, as in the tales collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn|J. G. Von Hahn]] in his ''Griechische und Albanische M\u00e4rchen'' (Leipzig, 1864), in the village of [[Zagori]] in [[Epirus]],<ref>''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion''. Arthur Bernard Cook. Cambridge University Press. 1925. p. 1006-1007.</ref> and by Auguste Dozon in ''Contes Albanais'' (Paris, 1881). These stories substitute the quest for the items for the search for a fairy named ''[[E Bukura e Dheut]]'' (\"Beauty of the Land\"), a woman of extraordinary beauty and magical powers.<ref>Elsie, Robert (2001).

In this version, it is a king who overhears the sisters' nightly conversation in his search for a wife for his son.

In this tale, the [[Rule of Seven|seventh]] queen begets the wonder-children ([[fraternal twins]], a girl and a boy); the antagonists are the other six queens, who, overcome with jealousy, trick the new queen with puppies and expose the children. When they both grow up, the jealous queens set the siblings on a quest for a ''kataki'' flower, with the brother rescuing Lady Pushpavati from [[Rakshasas]].

Another French variant, collected by [[Henry Carnoy]] (''L'Arbre qui chante, l'Oiseau qui parle et l'Eau d'or'', or \"The tree that sings, the bird that speaks and the water of gold\"), has the youngest daughter, the princess, marry an enchanted old man she meets in her journey and who gives her advice on how to obtain the items.<ref>Carnoy, Henry.

The box eventually washes ashore on the beaches of an island or another country. There, the child (or children) magically grows up in hours or days and builds an enchanted castle or house that attracts the attention of the common folk (or merchants, or travellers). Word reaches the ears of the despondent king, who hears about the mysterious owners of such fantastic abode, who just happen to look like the children he would have had.\n\nRussian tale collections attest to the presence of [[Baba Yaga]], the witch of [[Slavic folklore]], as the antagonist in many of the stories.<ref>Johns, Andreas. ''Baba Yaga: The Ambiguous Mother and Witch of the Russian Folktale''. New York: Peter Lang. 2010. pp. 244-246. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-6769-6}}</ref>\n\nIn some variants, the castaway boy sets a trap to rescue his brothers and release them from a [[Shapeshifting|transformation curse]]. For example, in ''N\u00e1d P\u00e9ter'' (\"Schilf-Peter\"), a Hungarian variant,<ref>R\u00f3na-Sklarek, Elisabet. ''Ungarische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Neue Folge. Leipzig: Dieterich. 1909. pp. 53-65.</ref> when the hero of the tale sees a flock of eleven swans flying, he recognizes them as their brothers, who have been transformed into birds due to divine intervention by [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and [[St. Peter]].\n\nIn another format, the boy asks his mother to prepare a meal with her \"breast milk\" and prepares to invade his brothers' residence to confirm if they are indeed his siblings. This plot happens in a Finnish variant, from [[Ingermanland]], collected in ''Finnische und Estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen'' (''Bruder und Schwester und die goldlockigen K\u00f6nigss\u00f6hne'', or \"Brother and Sister, and the golden-haired sons of the King\").<ref>L\u00f6wis of Menar, August von. ''Finnische und estnische Volksm\u00e4rchen''. Jena: Eugen Diederichs. 1922. pp. 53-59.</ref> The mother gives birth to six sons with special traits who are sold to a devil by the old midwife. Some time later, their youngest brother enters the devil's residence and succeeds in rescuing his siblings.\n\n===The Boys With The Golden Stars===\n\nThe motif of a woman's babies, born with wonderful attributes after she claimed she could bear such children, but stolen from her, is a common fairy tale motif. In this plot-type, an evil stepmother (or grandmother, or gypsy, or slave, or maid) kills the babies, but the twins go through a resurrective reincarnation: from trees to animals and finally into humans babies again. This [[Transformation chase|transformation chase]] where the stepmother is unable to prevent the children's reappearance is unusual, although it appears in \"[[A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers]]\" and in \"The Count's Evil Mother\", a [[Croatia]]n tale from the [[Karlovac]] area.<ref name=\"vrki\u01071997\">{{cite book|last=Vrki\u0107|first= Jozo|authorlink=Jozo Vrki\u0107 |title=Hrvatske bajke|location= Glagol, Zagreb|year= 1997}} The tale first published in written form by Rudolf Strohal.</ref>\n\nMost versions of ''The Boys With Golden Stars'' begin with the birth of male twins, but very rarely there are fraternal twins, a boy and a girl. When they transform into human babies again, the siblings grow up at an impossibly fast rate and hide their supernatural trait under a hood or a cap. Soon after, they show up in their father's court or house to reveal the truth through a riddle or through a ballad.\n\nThis tale's format happens in many variants collected in the [[Balkan]] area, specially in Romenia,<ref name=\"autogenerated121\">''Die goldenen kinder''.

Very rarely, it is one of the children themselves that reveal the aunts' treachery to their father, as seen in the [[Armenia|Armenian]] variants ''The Twins'' and ''Theodore, le Danseur''.<ref>Hoogasian-Villa, Susie.

This version of the tale preserves the motif of the wonder-children, which are born \"with golden chains around their necks\", the substitution for animals and the degradation of the mother, but merges with the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}, which is [[Aarne-Thompson]] 451, \"The boys or brothers transformed into birds\".\n\nIn a brief summary:<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/><ref name=Hibbard240-1>{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}</ref> a lord encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace, they marry and she gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan \u201c''quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum'' (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).\u201d<ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/>\n\nThe motif of the heroine persecuted by the queen, on false pretenses, also happens in ''Istoria della Regina Stella e Mattabruna'',<ref>''Istoria della Regina Stella e Mattabruna: dove leggendo sentirete come farono mandati i figliuoli ad annegare, e le fu posto nel letto quattro cagnoli, e dopo fu messa prigione, i condannata a morte per false accuse, e fu liberata dai suni figliuoli con la morte del gigante.'' 1822.

In the second part of the tale, the youngest child, a girl, witnesses her brothers' transformation into crows, but she is eventually found and marries a Rajah of a neighboring region. Her child, the prince, learns of his family history and ventures on a quest to reverse his uncles's transformation. At the climax of the story, the boy invites his grandfather and his co-wives and reveals the whole plot, as the family reunites.<ref>Frere, Mary Eliza Isabella.

It was first brought by traders from Western Indonesia, then developed when the [[Dutch Empire]] [[Dutch East Indies|colonised]] the [[Maluku Islands]]. This was the first example of the transliteration of Malay into the [[Latin script]]{{clarify|date=December 2018}} and it was used as a tool by [[missionaries]] in Eastern Indonesia. Malay has been taught in schools and churches in Ambon, and because of this it has become a [[lingua franca]] in Ambon and its surroundings.\n\nChristian speakers use Ambonese Malay as their [[mother tongue]], while Muslims speak it as a second language as they have their own language. Muslims on Ambon Island particularly live in several areas in the city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], dominant in the Salahutu and Leihitu Peninsulas. While in the Lease (/le\u026a-a-se\u026a/) Islands, the Christian Ambonese-speaking community is dominant in parts of [[Haruku]], [[Saparua]] and [[Nusa Laut]] islands. Ambonese Malay has also become lingua franca in [[Buru]], [[Seram]], Geser-Gorom and the south-western Maluku Islands, though with different accents.\n\nWhile originally derived from Malay, Ambonese Malay has been heavily influenced by European languages (Dutch and Portuguese) as well as the vocabularies or grammatical structures of indigenous languages. It is famous for its melodious accent.{{clarify|date=December 2018}} Muslims and Christian speakers tend to make different choices in vocabulary. [[Papuan Malay]], a Malay creole spoken in the Indonesian part of [[New Guinea]], is closely related to Ambonese Malay and is said to be a derivative of Ambonese Malay or [[Manado Malay]] or a mixture of both. According to Robert B. Allen and Rika Hayami-Allen, the eastern Indonesian forms of Malay have their roots in [[North Moluccan Malay]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robert B. Allen|author2=Rika Hayami-Allen|title=Orientation in the Spice Islands|page=21|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/allen2002orientation.pdf|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Morpho-syntax==\n\n===Pronouns and person markers===\nIn Ambonese Malay, personal [[pronoun]]s typically have a full form, as well as another one or more shortened and/or variant forms.<ref name=\"Mindep130\">Van Minde 1997, p. 68<br /></ref> The pronouns vary in terms of [[number]] - singular and plural, as well as [[clusivity]], such as exclusive forms which exclude the addressee and inclusive forms which include the addressee. Such distinction is relatively typical of [[Austronesian language]]s. The following table provides a summary of all the pronouns found in Ambonese Malay:\n\n'''Personal pronouns''' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person\n!

They are:\n\n* ''Bat'ong''\nDerives from ''beta'' 'I (1SG) + ''orang'' 'people; man' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n* ''Kat'ong''\nDerives from *''kita'' 'we (1PL) + ''orang'' 'people; man' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n* ''Dorang''\nDerives from ''dia'' 'he; she; it (3SG) + ''orang'' 'people; man' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n2) The 2nd person singular form ''ose'' is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]  pronoun ''voce'', meaning 'you; thou'.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n3) The 2nd person singular form ''ale'' is derived from a vernacular language.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n====Politeness====\n\nSimilarly to other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the 2nd person singular and one of the 3rd person singular pronouns in Ambonese Malay vary in their degree of politeness. They are summarised in the following table:<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person\n! Politeness marking\n! Full singular form\n! Short singular form\n|-\n| 2nd\n| Markedly impolite\nUsed in familiar and intimate relationships and when no outspoken respect needs to be expressed\n\nExpresses intimacy. Used among peers, or to people of lower status.\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | ose\n\nAle\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | os\nse\n\nal\n|-\n| 3rd\n| Markedly polite. Used by people of younger age to refer to adults and by adults to refer to people of equal or higher social rank.\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | Ontua; ongtua; antua; angtua\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | \n|}\n\nIt is also important to note that although in Ambonese the 1st person singular form ''beta'' is the standard form, in Classical Malay, it is used only by royal persons speaking to equals of rank.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n===== Syntactic positions =====\nAs previously mentioned, Ambonese pronouns consist of a full and one or more variant form. Full forms occur in every syntactic position. Variant form have a more restricted distribution and may be functionally different.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/> The following table summarises the set of full personal pronouns plus (in brackets) their variant forms according to context and syntactic function:\n\n'''Personal pronouns and their syntactic function''' <ref name=\"Mindep130\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person\n! One-word sentence\n! Subject\n! Object (of verb or prep.)\n|-\n| 1S\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | beta\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | beta (bet; be)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | beta\n|-\n| 2S\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | ose (os; se)\nale\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | ose (os; se)\nale (al)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | ose (os; se)\nale\n|-\n| 3S\n\n3SN\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dia\nantua (etc.)\nontua (etc.)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dia (di; de)\nantua (etc.)\nontua (etc.)\nakang\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dia \nantua (etc.)\nontua (etc.)\nakang (kang; ang)\n|-\n| 1P\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | kat'ong\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | kat'ong (tong)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | kat'ong\n|-\n| 2P\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dorang (dong)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dorang (dong)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dorang (dong)\n|-\n| 3P\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dorang (dong)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dorang (dong)\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | dorang (dong)\n|}\n\nFrom this table it follows that two factors determine whether a personal pronoun can be shortened: syntactic construction and syntactic position:\n\n* Except for the first person singular ''beta'', first person plural ''kat'ong'' and third person singular ''dia'', all pronouns can be shortened in one-word sentences. Third person singular neuter ''akang'' cannot form a one-word sentence altogether.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n* In clauses all personal pronouns in Subject position may be shortened, except for third person singular neutral ''akang''.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n* In clauses all personal pronouns in Object position may be shortened, except for first person singular ''beta'', first person plural ''kat'ong'', second person ''ale'' and third person singular ''dia''.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n* Likewise, as preposition object all personal pronouns except for ''beta'', ''ale'', ''kat'ong'' and ''dia'' may be shortened.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\nThese facts show that ''se'', ''os'' 'you', ''dong'' 'you', ''ont'o, ant'o, ant'u'' 'he; she' and ''dong'' 'they' have developed into doublets which are functionally (but not semantically) on a par with their full forms, while other short forms (''bet, al, kang, ang'') are phonological variants with a more restricted distribution.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\nIt is also important to note a number of syntactic variations within the functions of personal pronouns in Ambonese:\n\n1) The 3rd person single ''dia'' 's/he; it' can be shortened to ''di'' or ''de'' when it is in Subject position, or when it is head of a Noun Phrase (NP) in object position.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n2) The 3rd person single ''antua'' (and ''angtua, ontua, ongtua'') is also a modifier of head nominals in a phrase, thereby adding an aspect of deference.

Its basic word order has the subject in initial position, followed by the verb and then the object, as shown below.  'Subject, verb, object' are labelled 'S, V, O' respectively:\n{| class=\"sortable\"\n|+\n|''Pombo''\n|''kasi''\n|''tongka''\n|''satu''\n|''for''\n|''Kes.''\n|-\n|dove\n|give\n|stick\n|one\n|to\n|monkey\n|-\n|S\n|V\n|O\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |\"Dove gave a stick to Monkey.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 184</ref>\n|}<br />\n\n=== Negation ===\nNegation in Ambonese Malay is sentential rather than constituent.  Negation is predominantly expressed by five free morphemes that are treated as adverbs, modifying predicates, clauses or parts of the sentence as opposed to specific elements (such as single verbs or nominals).  These morphemes are listed below alongside their common variants and English equivalents:\n\n* ''seng \u2018no, not\u2019'' \n* ''tar (tra) \u2018no, not\u2019''\n* ''bal\u2019ong (blong) \u2018not yet\u2019''\n* ''bukang \u2018no, not\u2019''\n*  ''jangang (jang) \u2018don\u2019t\u2019''.<ref name=\":0\">Van Minde 1997, p. 273</ref>\n\n<br>\n\n'''Constituent order'''\n\nAmbonese Malay negators are typically positioned between the subject and the VO-group.  This word order is typical of SVO languages.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the following example, the subject pronoun ''de'' precedes the negator ''seng (''represented here as ''sem''), and the verb group headed by the verb ''bisa'' follows it.\n{|\n|+\n|''Der''\n|''tadi''\n|''de''\n|''so''\n|''sem''\n|''bisa''\n|''k''\n|''atas''\n|''lei.''\n|-\n|From\n|just now\n|3S\n|Pha\n|no\n|can\n|to\n|top\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\"Just now she already couldn't go up (the tree) anymore.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 275\n\nNote: In this example, seng is represented as sem, as the phoneme /\u014b/ has become bilabial /m/, assimilating to the place of articulation of the bilabial consonant /b/ in the following morpheme bisa.</ref>\n|}<br />\n\n==== Summary of distinguishing features ====\n\n# All negators except ''tar/tra'' can be used as one-word sentences in response to a Yes-No question.<ref name=\":1\">Van Minde 1997, p. 276</ref>\n# All negators except ''jangang/jang'' can be used in declarative and interrogative sentence types.  \n# Only ''jangang/jang'' can be used in an imperative sentence.\n\nThese features will be explored in greater detail below.\n\n==== ''Seng'' ====\n''Seng'' is the most commonly used negator.\n\nAlthough Ambonese Malay generally operates on the premise of sentential negation, ''seng'' can be used in a marked word order to narrow the scope of negation to single verbs or nominals.  ''Seng'' moves rightwards in the clause, shifting the focus of negation to the word it immediately precedes.  In the first example below, ''seng'' occurs in its default position between the subject ''de'' and the verb group headed by ''kar'ja,'' modifying the verb group ''kar'ja bat'ul'' in a general sense.  In the second example, ''seng'' is integrated into the verb group itself, immediately preceding and placing the emphasis of negation on the verbal modifier ''bat'ul.''        \n{|\n|+\n|''De''\n|''seng''\n|''karj'a''\n|''bat'ul.''\n|-\n|3S\n|no\n|work\n|right\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"He doesn't work well.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''De''\n|''karj'a''\n|''seng''\n|''bat'ul.''\n|-\n|3S\n|work\n|no\n|right\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"He works not well.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n|}\n\n''Seng'' also collocates with modal auxiliary ''usa'' to express a lack of necessity:\n{|\n|+\n|''Papa,''\n|''seng''\n|''usa''\n|''mara,''\n|''deng''\n|''seng''\n|''usa''\n|''malu.''\n|-\n|Father\n|no\n|necessary\n|angry\n|and\n|no\n|necessary\n|ashamed\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"Father, you don't have to be angry and you don't have to be ashamed.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 193</ref>\n|}\n\n''Seng'' is also used with the reduplicated interrogative pronoun ''apa,'' meaning 'what', in a fixed expression to denote 'nothing', or 'not anything':\n{|\n|+\n|''Seng''\n|''apa-apa.''\n|\n|\n|-\n|No\n|Red#what\n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"It's nothing; it doesn't matter.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 133</ref>\n|}<br />\n\n==== ''Tar/tra'' ====\nUnlike all other Ambonese Malay negators, ''tar/tra'' cannot form a one-word sentence.  It is typically regarded as a marker of emphatic negation, and can be used alongside ''seng'' and with reduplication to achieve even greater emphasis.  In the example below, ''ampas'' is reduplicated, following both negators ''seng'' and ''tra.''\n{|\n|+\n|''Ose''\n|''nanti''\n|''seng''\n|''ampas,''\n|''ose''\n|''tra''\n|''ampas''\n|''lei!''\n|-\n|2S\n|wait\n|no\n|waste\n|2S\n|no\n|waste\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"You just wait; nothing, not even waste of you will remain (i.e. I won't spare you at all!)\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n|}\n\n''Tar/tra'' also commonly collocates with:\n\n* existential verb ''ada'' 'be (somewhere)'\n*''bai'' 'good'\n* modal auxiliary ''bole'' 'may, be allowed'\n\n<br />\n\n{|\n|+\n|''Tar''\n|''ada''\n|''uba''\n|''tu!''\n|-\n|no\n|be\n|medicine\n|that\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"There was no medicine at all!\"<ref name=\":2\">Van Minde 1997, p. 277</ref>\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Dong''\n|''seng''\n|''piker''\n|''akang,''\n|''kata''\n|''itu''\n|''tar''\n|''bae.''\n|-\n|3P\n|no\n|think\n|3Sn\n|Conj\n|that\n|no\n|good\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"They don't think about it, <that is> that it is really bad.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Tar''\n|''bole''\n|''tu!''\n|-\n|no\n|may\n|that\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"You may not do that!\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n|}\n\n==== ''Bal'ong/blong'' ====\n'''<nowiki/>'''\n''Bal'ong'' marks both negation and the phasal aspect 'yet', denoting 'not yet'.\n'''<nowiki/>'''\n{|\n|+\n|''Dong''\n|''su''\n|''makang''\n|''deng''\n|''bal'ong''\n|''gal'ap''\n|''lai.''\n|-\n|3P\n|Pha\n|eat\n|and\n|not yet\n|dark\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"They have eaten and it isn't dark yet <so just let the children play outside>.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n|}\n\nSimilar to ''tar/tra'' it can also be used as a marker of emphatic negation alongside a reduplicated verb, as in the example below where ''bal'ong'' co-occurs with the reduplicated verb ''pulang-pulang:''\n{|\n|+\n|''An-ana''\n|''tu,''\n|''dong''\n|''bilang:''\n|''\"E!''\n|''Mama''\n|''tu,''\n|''ant'o''\n|''bal'ong''\n|''pulang-pulang.\"''\n|-\n|Red#child \u00a0\n|that\n|3P\n|say\n|Inter\n|mother\n|that\n|3S\n|not yet\n|Red#return\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" |\"The children said: 'Hey, mother, she still has not come home yet.'\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 126</ref>\n|}\n\n==== ''Bukang'' ====\nAccording to van Minde's research findings'', bukang'' is the least commonly used negator in Ambonese Malay.<ref name=\":3\">Van Minde 1997, p. 278</ref>  It expresses a 'contrast which implies an alternative' - ''bukang'' X means 'not X (but on the contrary) Y)':<ref name=\":3\" />\n{|\n|+\n|''Dia''\n|''tu''\n|''bukang''\n|''guru''\n|''mar''\n|''soldadu.''\n|-\n|3S\n|that\n|no\n|teacher\n|but\n|soldier\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |\"He wasn't a teacher, but a soldier.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n|}\n\nIt may also occur in sentences with contrastive stress, combined with the use of 'higher pitch and articulatory strength'<ref name=\":3\" /> to articulate the constituents that are the focus of the negation.

Van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;22) uses the term \u201clexically reduplicated morphemes\u201d which means that both of the roots that compose the morpheme contain an important (e.g. stressed) syllable. However, in the case of duplicated [[monosyllable]]s, neither of the roots are perceptible as regards stress. Each accent on the syllables will be marked even if the morpheme is made up of a duplicated monosyllable. The reason being is to differentiate them from morphemes that are '''monomorphemic''' (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;22). Examples of this would be (p.&nbsp;22): \n ''/g\u2019igi/ \u2018tooth\u2019; /pomp\u2019om/ in: /s\u2019agu pomp\u2019om/ k.o sago-cake roasted in cartridge-cases.''\n\nCompare the examples with the following (p.&nbsp;23): \n ''/\u2019 eleK\u2019 eleK/ \u2018oil-lamp made from glass jar\u2019; /t\u2019omit\u2019 omi/ k.o. cherry-like fruit.''\n\nWordstress is the only different feature in a number of [[minimal pair]]s (p.&nbsp;23): \n ''/b\u2019aca\u014b/ Bacan (island) - /bac\u2019a\u014b/ k.o. fruit;''\n\n ''/p\u2019ara\u014b/ \u2018machete\u2019 - /par\u2019a\u014b/ \u2018war\u2019;''\n\n ''/t\u2019are/ \u2018to attract s.t.\u2019 - /tar\u2019e/ \u2018tight''\n\n=== Vowel phonemes ===\nAmbonese contains 5 [[Phoneme|vowel phonemes]] as illustrated in the chart (van Minde 1997, p. 24):\n\n'''<u>Vowel system</u>'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n!Front\n!Central\n!Back\n|-\n!High\n|i\n|\n|u\n|-\n!Non-high:\n\n\u00b7       Mid\n\n\u00b7       Low\n|e\n|a\n|o\n|-\n|\n|'''Unrounded'''\n|'''Unrounded'''\n|'''Rounded'''\n|}\n\nAmbonese Malay do not have phonemic glottal stop /\u0294/ but phonetically the [[glottal stop]] is noticed word-initially, morpheme-initially after a vowel, and morpheme-medially between like vowels (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;24). Examples are (p.&nbsp;24): \n ''/\u2019ose/ [''\u0294''\u2019 ose] \u2018you\u2019;''\n\n ''/baku\u2019atur/ [baku#''\u0294\u2019atur] \u2018to arrange with one another\u2019\nIn addition, there might be borrowed words from other indigenous languages, there is individual variation, and [\u0294] is occasionally heard (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;24): \n ''/pa\u2019isal/ [pa''\u0294 \u2018''isal] = [pa\u2019isal]'' k.o. small proa;\n\n ''/n\u2019oul. [n\u2019o''\u0294''ul] = [n\u2019oul]'' k.o. fish \n[[Nasal vowel|Nasalised vowels]] happen expectedly before nasal consonants belonging to the same syllable. Due to this, van Minde considers nasalization as a \u201cphonetic phenomenon\u201d. He gave some examples as well (1997, pp.&nbsp;24\u201325): \n ''/\u2019aNbo''\u014b/ [\u0294\u2019''\u0101m.b\u00f5\u014b] \u2018Ambon; Ambonese\u2019;''\n\n ''/kaNp\u2019iNja\u014b/ [k\u00e3m.p\u2019\u0129\u00f1.j\u00e3\u014b] \u2018churchbell\u2019''\n\nNasalisation is invalid past syllable-boundaries like for example (p.&nbsp;24-25): \n ''/an\u2019io\u014b/ [''\u0294''a.n\u2019i.y\u00f5\u014b] \u2018rolled up cloth to support load carried on head\u2019''\n\n ''/ba#\u2019aNbur/ [ba.'' \u0294''\u2019\u0101mbur] \u2018to strew, scatter (repeatedly)''\n\n==== High front unrounded /i/ ====\nAccording to van Minde (1997, p. 25), the high front unrounded vowel /i/ is always perceived as [i], and it always take place in non-final and final closed and open syllables. /i/ in final syllables (whether they are open or closed) can be replaced by /e/ however this only applies in some polysyllabic morphemes. Though /i/ can be replaced by /e/, it does not work in reverse thus it can\u2019t be said the conflict between these two phonemes is negated in that position and environment (van Minde 1997, p. 25).\n\nBesides position and stress, further restrictions on the alternation /i \u2248 e/ is given in two [[phonological rule]]s (PR). The change in final unstressed syllables of polysyllabic morphemes is not attested in (van Minde, 1997 p. 25):<blockquote>PR<sub>1</sub>: final syllables ending in /s/;</blockquote><blockquote>PR<sub>2</sub>: open final syllables when the penultimate syllable contains /u/ or /i/</blockquote>\n\nVan Minde (1997, p. 25) regards /i/ as a \u2018heavy phoneme\u2019 wherever there is a change /i ~ e/, which means in environments that are different from those interpreted by PR<sub>1</sub> and PR<sub>2</sub>. The definition of \u2018heavy phoneme\u2019 is defined as \u201cconsists of one or more optional distinctive features in addition to the basic distinctive features, whereas a basic phoneme consists of basic distinctive features only\u201d (Ebeling 1967; Stokhof 1975). Van Minde deduces that /i/ is a heavy phoneme in environments excluded by PR<sub>1</sub> and PR<sub>2</sub>; /e/ being its basic phoneme and [relative highness] is a voluntary feature. Examples are given in the following (p.&nbsp;25):\n ''/katiNd\u2019isa\u014b/ [kat\u0129nd\u2019is\u0101\u014b] \u2018to talk or rave while sleep\u2019''\n\n ''/ir/ [\u0294ir] \u2018drunk\u2019'' \n* '''closed final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;26)''':''' \n ''/k\u2019ukis/ [k\u2019ukis *k\u2019ukes] \u2018biscuit\u2019''\n\n ''/kac\u2019il/ [kac\u2019il *kac\u2019el] \u2018small\u2019''\n* '''open final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;26)''':'''\n ''/p\u2019uti/ [p\u2019uti *p\u2019ute] \u2018white\u2019''\n\n ''/h\u2019ari \u2248 h\u2019are/ \u2018day\u2019''\n\n==== Mid front unrounded vowel /e/ ====\nThe mid front unrounded vowel /e/ is perceived as [e] (or [\u0113] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&nbsp;26): \n ''/b\u2019esi/ [b\u2019esi] \u2018iron/steel\u2019''\n\n  ''/b\u2019erkaT/ [b\u2019erkat-] \u2018divine blessing\u2019''\nThe phonemic status of /e/ versus /i/ is attested by the followed minimal pairs (p.&nbsp;26):\n ''/\u2019ina/ \u2018mother\u2019 - /\u2019ena/ \u2018tasty, delicious\u2019''\n\n ''/p\u2019ici/ \u2018to peel\u2019 - /p\u2019eci/ \u2018mud\u2019'' \nThe examples illustrated distinctly that /i/ is resistant to /e/ in morpheme-final syllables, hence the change /i \u2248 e/ in final syllables under the previous restrictions stated in the phonological rules cannot be clarified as neutralization (van Minde 1997, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327).\n\n==== Low central vowel /a/ ====\nThe low central vowel in Ambonese Malay is perceived as [a] (or [\u0101] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&nbsp;27):\n ''/\u2019a\u00f1er/ [\u0294\u2019a\u00f1er] \u2018bad fishy smell\u2019''\n\n ''/kal\u2019apa/ [kal\u2019apa] \u2018coconut\u2019''\n\nThe minimal pairs attest the resistance between /a/ and /i/ (p.&nbsp;27):\n ''/s\u2019atu/ \u2018one\u2019 - /s\u2019itu/ \u2018there\u2019''\n\n ''/bal\u2019a/ \u2018to split s.t.\u2019 - /bal\u2019i/ \u2018to buy s.t.\u2019''\n\nThe opposition between /a/ and /e/ is shown by the presented minimal pairs (p.&nbsp;27):\n ''/cak\u2019a/ \u2018to strangle s.o.\u2019 - /cak\u2019e/ \u2018(vulg) to eat, stuff o.s.\u2019''\n\n ''/b\u2019aca/ \u2018to read\u2019 - /b\u2019eca/ \u2018pedicab\u2019''\n\n==== High back rounded vowel /u/ ====\n/u/ happens in non-final and final closed and open position. This high back rounded vowel is always perceived as [u] (or [\u0169] due to nasalization). However, /u/ in final unstressed syllables (whether open or closed) consistently alternates with /o/ when in certain polysyllabic morphemes (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;27). In addition, not all /o/ in this position and environment alternates with /u/, thus these two phonemes are not balanced. According to van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;27), the change /u \u2248 o/ in final unstressed syllables of polysyllabic morphemes is not proven in (p.&nbsp;27):<blockquote>PR<sub>3</sub>: open final syllables when the penultimate syllable have /u/ or /i/</blockquote>\n\nThis situation is alike to the change between the high and mid front vowels /i \u2248 e/, where /u/ is seen as a heavy phoneme, /o/ as the basic phoneme and [relative phoneme] is the optional feature. The following examples prove this assertion (p.&nbsp;28): \n ''/t\u2019obu/ [t\u2019obu] \u2248 /t\u2019obo/ [t\u2019obo] \u2018sugar cane\u2019''\n\n ''/\u2019uNpa\u014b/ [\u0294\u2019 \u0169mp\u00e3\u014b] \u2018bait\u2019''\n* '''Closed final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;28)''':'''\n ''/c\u2019aNpur \u2248 c\u2019aNpor/ \u2018to mix\u2019''\n\n ''/c\u2019abuT \u2248 c\u2019aboT/ \u2018let\u2019s go!\u2019''\n* '''Open final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;29)''':'''\n /tapar\u2019egu \u2248 tapar\u2019ego/ \u2018to do s.t. hurriedly\u2019\n\n /cap\u2019atu \u2248 cap\u2019ato/ \u2018shoe\u2019 \n* '''Minimal pairs shown to the resistance between /u/ and /i/''' (p.&nbsp;29)''':'''\n /k\u2019utu/ \u2018louse\u2019 - /k\u2019uti/ \u2018snap\u2019\n\n /g\u2019ula/ \u2018sugar\u2019 - /g\u2019ila/ \u2018mad\u2019 \n* '''The resistance between /u/ and /e/ can be shown by''' (p.&nbsp;29)''':'''\n /b\u2019ula\u014b/ \u2018moon, month\u2019- /b\u2019ela\u014b/ in: /aruNb\u2019 aI b\u2019ela\u014b/ k.o. large proa\n\n The resistance between /u/ and /a/ is attested by:\n\n /\u2019uru/ \u2018to massage\u2019 \u2013 /\u2019aru/ \u2018Aru Islands\u2019\n\n==== Mid back rounded vowel /o/ ====\nThe mid back rounded vowel /o/ is seen as [o] (or [\u00f5] due to nasalization).

This is because there is '''no opposition between /u/ and /w/ in this environment''' (p.&nbsp;31)'':'' \n ''/l\u2019aUta\u014b/ [l\u2019aut\u00e3\u014b] \u2018deep-sea\u2019''\n\nThe second reason proposed by van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;32) is that '''/U/ occurs after a consonant and directly before a stressed vowel''' (p.&nbsp;32): \n ''/bU\u2019aya/ [bu\u2019aya] \u2018crocodile\u2019''\n\nNevertheless, '''not every pattern /Cw\u2019V/ is collateral by a sequence /CU\u2019V/''' (p.&nbsp;32): \n ''/swaK/ [swak-] \u2018weak, feeble\u2019''\n\n==== Archiphoneme /I/ ====\nThis results from the neutralization of the resistance /i/-/y/ in unstressed position after a vowel or instantly before a stressed vowel (p.&nbsp;32): \n ''/m\u2019uI/ [m\u2019ui, muy] \u2018aunt\u2019'' \n* Van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;32) showed some examples of '''/I/ before a stressed vowel:''' \n ''/I\u2019a/ [I\u2019a, iy\u2019a] \u2018yes (formal)\u2019''\n\n ''/bI\u2019asa/ [bi\u2019asa] \u2018normal, usual\u2019'' \n* '''The resistance of /i/ and /y/''' is shown by (p.&nbsp;33): \n ''/t\u2019iU/ [t\u2019iyu] \u2018uncle\u2019''\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThere are '''19 [[consonant]]s phonemes''' and '''4 consonant [[archiphoneme]]s''' in Ambonese Malay and they are charted below (van Minde 1997, pp.&nbsp;40\u201341):\n\n'''<u>Consonant system</u>'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Place\n\nManner\n!Labial\n!Alveolar\n!Palatal\n!Velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n!Voice\n|<nowiki>-                              +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                              +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                               +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                                 +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                          +</nowiki>\n|-\n!Archiphoneme\n|              P\n|              T\n|              N\n|\n|              K\n|-\n!Stop\n|p                           b\n|t                             d\n|c                             j\n|k                               g\n|\n|-\n!Nasal\n|                 m\n|                  n\n|                 \u00f1\n|                 \u014b\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|f\n|s\n|\n|\n|h\n|-\n!Lateral, trill\n|\n|                l, r\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Semivowel\n|                 w\n|\n|                 y \n|\n|\n|}\n\n==== Archiphonemes /P, T, K, N/ ====\nThese archiphonemes is a consequence from the neutralization of the opposition between /p/- /b/, /t/-/d/, and /k/-/g/ respectively in two positions and under certain conditions (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;40):\n\n1.    Frequency of /P, T, K/ is especially high in word-final position. Most words with /P, T, K/ in this position are borrowed words from Dutch (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;41). This is due to the many words of Malay origin to have lost final stops *p, *t, *k, or *\u0294. Example: ''*tutup > tutu \u2018to close\u2019.''\n\nWordfinally the archiphonemes /P, T, K/ have a voiceless unreleased realization. Examples are shown (p.&nbsp;41): \n ''/keP/ [kep-] \u2018notch, nick\u2019 (<Dukeep)''\n\n ''/\u2019aNbaK/ [\u0294\u2019\u00e3mbak-] \u2018character, habit\u2019''\n\nA significant number of polysyllabic words with non-final stress have a doublet without final /P, T, K/ in non emphatic speech (p.&nbsp;41):\n ''/r\u2019unuT \u2248 runu/ \u2018fibroid material growing on palm trees\u2019''\nIn addition, van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;42) states that /P, T, K/ are \u201cheavy archiphonemes\u201d in this position and environment.\n\n2.    The archiphonemes /P, T, K/ have a voiceless unreleased realization in syllable-final position right before a stop, a nasal, fricative /s/, or the lateral /l/. Example is shown (p.&nbsp;42): \n ''/b\u2019aKso/ [b\u2019ak-so] \u2018(Chinese) meatball\u2019''\n\nArchiphoneme /N/ is also developed from the neutralization of the opposition between /m, n, \u00f1/ and /\u014b/ before their own homorgonaic obstruents /l/ (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;42). Example is followed (p.&nbsp;42): \n ''/naNl\u2019ohi/ [n\u00e3nl\u2019ohi] Nanlohi (clan name)''\n\n==== Stops ====\nThe [[Stop consonant|voiceless and voiced stops]] of the series /p, b, t, d, c, j, k, g/ are found in word-medial position and word-initial. /p, b/ are bilabials, /d/ is an apico-alveolar, /c, j/ are laminal-palatals, /t/ is an apico-alveodental, /k, g/ are dorsal-velars.

They take place word-initially and word-medially before vowels. However, in the environment of word-initially, the functional load of /\u00f1/ and /\u014b/ is low. Examples are shown (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;45): \n ''/\u00f1\u2019amu/ [\u00f1\u2019amu] \u2018mosquito\u2019''\n\n ''/\u00f1o\u014b/ [\u00f1\u00f5\u014b] \u2018term of address for boys\u2019''\nIn morpheme-final position, nasals other than /\u014b/ are barely proven and thus van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;46) finds it hard to find minimal pairs that are different in morpheme-final nasal phoneme.\n\n==== Fricatives ====\nThe labio-dental [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] /f/ takes place only in borrowed words and in words of unknown origin. Examples are shown (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;46):\n ''/f\u2019ader/ [f\u2019ader] \u2018term of address for men\u2019''\nThe alveolar fricative /s/ happens in word-initial, -medial, and \u2013final position. Examples are shown (p.&nbsp;47): \n ''/saw\u2019aI/ [saw\u2019ai] \u2018awry\u2019''\n\n ''/rab\u2019us/ [rab\u2019us] \u2018to boil\u2019''\nThe glottal fricative /h/ takes place word-medially and word-initially. However, in the use of interjections such as /ih/ \u2018Hey!\u2019 and /ah/ \u2018Oh no!\u2019- /h/ occur word-finally (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;47) .\n\nAlso, word-medial /h/ is optional in certain words; when /h/ is removed between like vowels, one of the two adjacent vowel segments is also deleted. Examples are illustrated below (p.&nbsp;47): \n ''/bah\u2019asa/ \u2248 /basa/ \u2018language\u2019''\n\n ''/mas\u2019ohi/ \u2248 /mas\u2019oI/ \u2018mutual aid\u2019''\n\n==== Liquids ====\nThe liquids /l/ and /r/ take place in word-initial, -medial, -final position, just like the [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar fricative]] /s/. Example is shown (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;48): \n ''/t\u2019ari/ [t\u2019ari] \u2018dance\u2019''\n\n==== Semivowels ====\nThe [[semivowel]]s /w/ and /y/ happen in word-initial and word-medial position before a vowel.

It was first brought by traders from Western Indonesia, then developed when the [[Dutch Empire]] [[Dutch East Indies|colonised]] the [[Maluku Islands]]. This was the first example of the transliteration of Malay into the [[Latin script]]{{what|date=December 2018}} and it was used as a tool by [[missionaries]] in Eastern Indonesia. Malay has been taught in schools and churches in Ambon, and because of this it has become a [[lingua franca]] in Ambon and its surroundings.\n\nChristian speakers use Ambonese Malay as their [[mother tongue]], while Muslims speak it as a second language as they have their own language. Muslims on Ambon Island particularly live in several areas in the city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], dominant in the Salahutu and Leihitu Peninsulas. While in the Lease (/le\u026a-a-se\u026a/) Islands, the Christian Ambonese-speaking community is dominant in parts of [[Haruku]], [[Saparua]] and [[Nusa Laut]] islands. Ambonese Malay has also become lingua franca in [[Buru]], [[Seram]], Geser-Gorom and the south-western Maluku Islands, though with different accents.\n\nWhile originally derived from Malay, Ambonese Malay has been heavily influenced by European languages (Dutch and Portuguese) as well as the vocabularies or grammatical structures of indigenous languages. It is famous for its melodious accent.{{what|date=December 2018}} Muslims and Christian speakers tend to make different choices in vocabulary. [[Papuan Malay]], a Malay creole spoken in the Indonesian part of [[New Guinea]], is closely related to Ambonese Malay and is said to be a derivative of Ambonese Malay or [[Manado Malay]] or a mixture of both. According to Robert B. Allen and Rika Hayami-Allen, the eastern Indonesian forms of Malay have their roots in [[North Moluccan Malay]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robert B.

Such distinction is relatively typical of [[Austronesian language]]s. The following table provides a summary of all the pronouns found in Ambonese Malay:\n\n'''Personal pronouns''' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person\n!

They are:\n\n* ''Bat'ong''\nDerives from ''beta'' 'I (1SG) + ''orang'' 'people; man' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n* ''Kat'ong''\nDerives from *''kita'' 'we (1PL) + ''orang'' 'people; man' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n* ''Dorang''\nDerives from ''dia'' 'he; she; it (3SG) + ''orang'' 'people; man' <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n2) The 2nd person singular form ''ose'' is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]  pronoun ''voce'', meaning 'you; thou'.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n3) The 2nd person singular form ''ale'' is derived from a vernacular language.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n====Politeness====\n\nSimilarly to other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the 2nd person singular and one of the 3rd person singular pronouns in Ambonese Malay vary in their degree of politeness. They are summarised in the following table:<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person\n! Politeness marking\n! Full singular form\n! Short singular form\n|-\n| 2nd\n| Markedly impolite\nUsed in familiar and intimate relationships and when no outspoken respect needs to be expressed\n\nExpresses intimacy. Used among peers, or to people of lower status.\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | ose\n\nAle\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | os\nse\n\nal\n|-\n| 3rd\n| Markedly polite. Used by people of younger age to refer to adults and by adults to refer to people of equal or higher social rank.\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | Ontua; ongtua; antua; angtua\n| style=\"font-style: italic;\" | \n|}\n\nIt is also important to note that although in Ambonese the 1st person singular form ''beta'' is the standard form, in Classical Malay, it is used only by royal persons speaking to equals of rank.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n===== Syntactic positions =====\nAs previously mentioned, Ambonese pronouns consist of a full and one or more variant form. Full forms occur in every syntactic position. Variant form have a more restricted distribution and may be functionally different.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/> The following table summarises the set of full personal pronouns plus (in brackets) their variant forms according to context and syntactic function:\n\n'''Personal pronouns and their syntactic function''' <ref name=\"Mindep130\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person\n! One-word sentence\n! Subject\n!

Third person singular neuter ''akang'' cannot form a one-word sentence altogether.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n* In clauses all personal pronouns in Subject position may be shortened, except for third person singular neutral ''akang''.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n* In clauses all personal pronouns in Object position may be shortened, except for first person singular ''beta'', first person plural ''kat'ong'', second person ''ale'' and third person singular ''dia''.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n* Likewise, as preposition object all personal pronouns except for ''beta'', ''ale'', ''kat'ong'' and ''dia'' may be shortened.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\nThese facts show that ''se'', ''os'' 'you', ''dong'' 'you', ''ont'o, ant'o, ant'u'' 'he; she' and ''dong'' 'they' have developed into doublets which are functionally (but not semantically) on a par with their full forms, while other short forms (''bet, al, kang, ang'') are phonological variants with a more restricted distribution.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\nIt is also important to note a number of syntactic variations within the functions of personal pronouns in Ambonese:\n\n1) The 3rd person single ''dia'' 's/he; it' can be shortened to ''di'' or ''de'' when it is in Subject position, or when it is head of a Noun Phrase (NP) in object position.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n2) The 3rd person single ''antua'' (and ''angtua, ontua, ongtua'') is also a modifier of head nominals in a phrase, thereby adding an aspect of deference. It adds a feature respect.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n'''Examples:'''\n\n    (1) ''Ant'o Onggo''\n         3S O.\n         Mr. Onggo <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n    (2) ''Antua parangpuan sana tu''\n         3S woman yonder that\n         the woman overthere <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n3) The third form, ''akang'', is a neater pronoun 'it', which also functions as a determiner. This form links up with the demonstratives ''ini'' and ''itu'' for deictic reference: it occurs as a single attribute before nouns, and in combination with postnominal ''tu''.\n\n'''Examples:'''\n\n    (1) ''Akang barang tu''\n         3Sn things that\n         those goods <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n    (2) ''Akang gunting di mana?''\n         3Sn scissors where\n         Where are the scissors?<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n4) The short form of ''dorang'', which is ''dong'', also functions as a modifier in NPs to create collective plurals.<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n'''Examples:'''\n\n    (1) ''mama dong''\n         mother 3P\n         mother and the others (i.e. the children, her family, friends, etc.)<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n    (2) ''Okto dong''\n          O. 3P\n          Okto and people who are like him <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n \n    (3) ''Anis dong''\n         A. 3P \n         Anis and his friends <ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n====Reduplication====\n\nReduplication with personal pronouns is not frequent. The following examples denote a concept \"referent of pronoun plus persons who are alike\":<ref name=\"Mindep130\"/>\n\n'''Examples:'''\n\n    (1) ''De seng datang lia kat'ong-kat'ong''\n         3S not come see Red#1P\n         He doesn't come to visit people like us <ref name=Mindep130 />\n\n    (2) ''Macang ose-ose bagini seng bisa dapa akang''\n          kind Red#2S like this not can get 3Sn\n          People like you now can't get it <ref name=Mindep130 />\n\n=== Word Order ===\nAmbonese Malay is a SVO (subject-verb-object) language. Its basic word order has the subject in initial position, followed by the verb and then the object, as shown below.  'Subject, verb, object' are labelled 'S, V, O' respectively:\n{| class=\"sortable\"\n|+\n|''Pombo''\n|''kasi''\n|''tongka''\n|''satu''\n|''for''\n|''Kes.''\n|-\n|dove\n|give\n|stick\n|one\n|to\n|monkey\n|-\n|S\n|V\n|O\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |\"Dove gave a stick to Monkey.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 184</ref>\n|}<br />\n=== Negation ===\nNegation in Ambonese Malay is sentential rather than constituent.  Negation is predominantly expressed by five free morphemes that are treated as adverbs, modifying predicates, clauses or parts of the sentence as opposed to specific elements (such as single verbs or nominals).  These morphemes are listed below alongside their common variants and English equivalents:\n\n* ''seng \u2018no, not\u2019'' \n* ''tar (tra) \u2018no, not\u2019''\n* ''bal\u2019ong (blong) \u2018not yet\u2019''\n* ''bukang \u2018no, not\u2019''\n*  ''jangang (jang) \u2018don\u2019t\u2019''. <ref name=\":0\">Van Minde 1997, p. 273</ref>\n\n<br>\n\n'''Constituent order'''\n\nAmbonese Malay negators are typically positioned between the subject and the VO-group.  This word order is typical of SVO languages.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the following example, the subject pronoun ''de'' precedes the negator ''seng (''represented here as ''sem''), and the verb group headed by the verb ''bisa'' follows it.\n{|\n|+\n|''Der''\n|''tadi''\n|''de''\n|''so''\n|''sem''\n|''bisa''\n|''k''\n|''atas''\n|''lei.''\n|-\n|From\n|just now\n|3S\n|Pha\n|no\n|can\n|to\n|top\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\"Just now she already couldn't go up (the tree) anymore.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 275\n\nNote: In this example, seng is represented as sem, as the phoneme /\u014b/ has become bilabial /m/, assimilating to the place of articulation of the bilabial consonant /b/ in the following morpheme bisa.</ref>\n|}<br />\n==== Summary of distinguishing features ====\n\n# All negators except ''tar/tra'' can be used as one-word sentences in response to a Yes-No question.<ref name=\":1\">Van Minde 1997, p. 276</ref>\n# All negators except ''jangang/jang'' can be used in declarative and interrogative sentence types.  \n# Only ''jangang/jang'' can be used in an imperative sentence.\n\nThese features will be explored in greater detail below.\n\n<br />\n\n==== ''Seng'' ====\n''Seng'' is the most commonly used negator.    \n\nAlthough Ambonese Malay generally operates on the premise of sentential negation, ''seng'' can be used in a marked word order to narrow the scope of negation to single verbs or nominals.  ''Seng'' moves rightwards in the clause, shifting the focus of negation to the word it immediately precedes.  In the first example below, ''seng'' occurs in its default position between the subject ''de'' and the verb group headed by ''kar'ja,'' modifying the verb group ''kar'ja bat'ul'' in a general sense.  In the second example, ''seng'' is integrated into the verb group itself, immediately preceding and placing the emphasis of negation on the verbal modifier ''bat'ul.''        \n{|\n|+\n|''De''\n|''seng''\n|''karj'a''\n|''bat'ul.''\n|-\n|3S\n|no\n|work\n|right\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"He doesn't work well.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''De''\n|''karj'a''\n|''seng''\n|''bat'ul.''\n|-\n|3S\n|work\n|no\n|right\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"He works not well.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n|}\n\n\n''Seng'' also collocates with modal auxiliary ''usa'' to express a lack of necessity:\n{|\n|+\n|''Papa,''\n|''seng''\n|''usa''\n|''mara,''\n|''deng''\n|''seng''\n|''usa''\n|''malu.''\n|-\n|Father\n|no\n|necessary\n|angry\n|and\n|no\n|necessary\n|ashamed\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"Father, you don't have to be angry and you don't have to be ashamed.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 193</ref>\n|}\n\n\n''Seng'' is also used with the reduplicated interrogative pronoun ''apa,'' meaning 'what', in a fixed expression to denote 'nothing', or 'not anything':\n{|\n|+\n|''Seng''\n|''apa-apa.''\n|\n|\n|-\n|No\n|Red#what\n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"It's nothing; it doesn't matter.\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 133</ref>\n|}<br />\n\n==== ''Tar/tra'' ====\nUnlike all other Ambonese Malay negators, ''tar/tra'' cannot form a one-word sentence.  It is typically regarded as a marker of emphatic negation, and can be used alongside ''seng'' and with reduplication to achieve even greater emphasis.  In the example below, ''ampas'' is reduplicated, following both negators ''seng'' and ''tra.''\n{|\n|+\n|''Ose''\n|''nanti''\n|''seng''\n|''ampas,''\n|''ose''\n|''tra''\n|''ampas''\n|''lei!''\n|-\n|2S\n|wait\n|no\n|waste\n|2S\n|no\n|waste\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"You just wait; nothing, not even waste of you will remain (i.e. I won't spare you at all!)\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n|}\n\n\n''Tar/tra'' also commonly collocates with:\n\n* existential verb ''ada'' 'be (somewhere)'\n*''bai'' 'good'\n* modal auxiliary ''bole'' 'may, be allowed'\n\n<br />\n\n{|\n|+\n|''Tar''\n|''ada''\n|''uba''\n|''tu!''\n|-\n|no\n|be\n|medicine\n|that\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"There was no medicine at all!\"<ref name=\":2\">Van Minde 1997, p. 277</ref>\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Dong''\n|''seng''\n|''piker''\n|''akang,''\n|''kata''\n|''itu''\n|''tar''\n|''bae.''\n|-\n|3P\n|no\n|think\n|3Sn\n|Conj\n|that\n|no\n|good\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"They don't think about it, <that is> that it is really bad.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Tar''\n|''bole''\n|''tu!''\n|-\n|no\n|may\n|that\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"You may not do that!\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n|}\n\n<br />\n\n==== ''Bal'ong/blong'' ====\n'''<nowiki/>'''\n''Bal'ong'' marks both negation and the phasal aspect 'yet', denoting 'not yet'.\n'''<nowiki/>'''\n{|\n|+\n|''Dong''\n|''su''\n|''makang''\n|''deng''\n|''bal'ong''\n|''gal'ap''\n|''lai.''\n|-\n|3P\n|Pha\n|eat\n|and\n|not yet\n|dark\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"They have eaten and it isn't dark yet <so just let the children play outside>.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n|}\n\n\nSimilar to ''tar/tra'' it can also be used as a marker of emphatic negation alongside a reduplicated verb, as in the example below where ''bal'ong'' co-occurs with the reduplicated verb ''pulang-pulang:''\n{|\n|+\n|''An-ana''\n|''tu,''\n|''dong''\n|''bilang:''\n|''\"E!''\n|''Mama''\n|''tu,''\n|''ant'o''\n|''bal'ong''\n|''pulang-pulang.\"''\n|-\n|Red#child \u00a0\n|that\n|3P\n|say\n|Inter\n|mother\n|that\n|3S\n|not yet\n|Red#return\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" |\"The children said: 'Hey, mother, she still has not come home yet.'\"<ref>Van Minde 1997, p. 126</ref>\n|}\n\n<br />\n\n==== ''Bukang'' ====\nAccording to van Minde's research findings'', bukang'' is the least commonly used negator in Ambonese Malay.<ref name=\":3\">Van Minde 1997, p. 278</ref>  It expresses a 'contrast which implies an alternative' - ''bukang'' X means 'not X (but on the contrary) Y)':<ref name=\":3\" />\n{|\n|+\n|''Dia''\n|''tu''\n|''bukang''\n|''guru''\n|''mar''\n|''soldadu.''\n|-\n|3S\n|that\n|no\n|teacher\n|but\n|soldier\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |\"He wasn't a teacher, but a soldier.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n|}\n\n\nIt may also occur in sentences with contrastive stress, combined with the use of 'higher pitch and articulatory strength'<ref name=\":3\" /> to articulate the constituents that are the focus of the negation.  In the examples below, these specific constituents are capitalised to demonstrate prosodic emphasis:\n{|\n|+\n|''Bukang''\n|''seng''\n|''BISA,''\n|''seng''\n|''DAPA''\n|''dangsa''\n|''deng''\n|''nona-nona.''\n|-\n|No\n|no\n|can\n|no\n|get\n|dance\n|with\n|Red#girl\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"Not that he COULD not (dance), he did not GET a dance(-partner) from among the girls.\"<ref name=\":4\">Van Minde 1997, p. 279</ref>\n|}\n\n<br />\n\n==== ''Jangang/jang'' ====\n''Jangang'' does not occur in declarative or interrogative sentences but is used to express negative imperatives, as in the example below - 'don't go to China.'\n{|\n|+\n|''Seng''\n|''usa,''\n|''jang''\n|''pi''\n|''di''\n|''tan''\n|''Cina.''\n|-\n|No\n|necessary\n|don't\n|go\n|to\n|land\n|China\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"That\u2019s not necessary, don\u2019t go to China.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n|}\n\n\nIt is also used in several 'short formulaic expressions':<ref name=\":5\">Van Minde 1997, p. 280</ref>\n{|\n|+\n|''Jang''\n|''mira''\n|''e.''\n|-\n|Don't\n|angry\n|Inter\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Excuse me; Sorry.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Jang''\n|''bilang''\n|''lai!''\n|-\n|Don't\n|say\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Incredible!

However, it can also be used with ''seng'', ''bal'ong,'' and ''jangang'' in non-exclamative sentences to denote, 'anymore; again', or 'still':\n{|\n|+\n|''De''\n|''so''\n|''seng''\n|''mo''\n|''pi''\n|''deng''\n|''beta''\n|''lei.''\n|-\n|3S\n|Pha\n|no\n|Fut\n|go\n|with\n|1S\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"He won't go with me anymore.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Jang''\n|''lei.''\n|-\n|Don't\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"Don't do that anymore/again.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Bal'ong''\n|''lei.''\n|-\n|Not yet\n|also\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"Still not yet.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n|}<br />\n\n===== ''<u>Ka</u>'' =====\n''Ka'' combines with negators ''seng'' and ''bal'ong'' to form a sentence-final tag for interrogative sentences:\n{|\n|+\n|''Se''\n|''su''\n|''makang''\n|''ka''\n|''blong?''\n|-\n|2S\n|Pha\n|eat\n|Ques\n|not yet\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"Have you eaten already?\"<ref name=\":6\">Van Minde 1997, p. 262</ref>\n|}\n{|\n|+\n|''Pap''\n|''mara''\n|''ka''\n|''seng?''\n|-\n|Father\n|angry\n|Ques\n|no\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"Are you angry, or not?\"<ref name=\":6\" />\n|}\n\n\nIn the above example the tag ''ka seng'' has converted a yes-no question \"Are you angry?\" into an alternative question \"Are you angry, or not?\"\n\n== Phonology ==\nAmbonese Malay has phonemic [[word stress]], by which is meant that the position of stress within a word is unforeseeable (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;21) . Van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;22) uses the term \u201clexically reduplicated morphemes\u201d which means that both of the roots that compose the morpheme contain an important (e.g. stressed) syllable. However, in the case of duplicated [[monosyllable]]s, neither of the roots are perceptible as regards stress. Each accent on the syllables will be marked even if the morpheme is made up of a duplicated monosyllable. The reason being is to differentiate them from morphemes that are '''monomorphemic''' (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;22). Examples of this would be (p.&nbsp;22): \n ''/g\u2019igi/ \u2018tooth\u2019; /pomp\u2019om/ in: /s\u2019agu pomp\u2019om/ k.o sago-cake roasted in cartridge-cases.''\n\nCompare the examples with the following (p.&nbsp;23): \n ''/\u2019 eleK\u2019 eleK/ \u2018oil-lamp made from glass jar\u2019; /t\u2019omit\u2019 omi/ k.o. cherry-like fruit.''\n\nWordstress is the only different feature in a number of [[minimal pair]]s (p.&nbsp;23): \n ''/b\u2019aca\u014b/ Bacan (island) - /bac\u2019a\u014b/ k.o. fruit;''\n\n ''/p\u2019ara\u014b/ \u2018machete\u2019 - /par\u2019a\u014b/ \u2018war\u2019;''\n\n ''/t\u2019are/ \u2018to attract s.t.\u2019 - /tar\u2019e/ \u2018tight''\n\n=== Vowel phonemes ===\nAmbonese contains 5 [[Phoneme|vowel phonemes]] as illustrated in the chart (van Minde 1997, p. 24):\n\n'''<u>Vowel system</u>'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n!Front\n!Central\n!Back\n|-\n!High\n|i\n|\n|u\n|-\n!Non-high:\n\n\u00b7       Mid\n\n\u00b7       Low\n|e\n|a\n|o\n|-\n|\n|'''Unrounded'''\n|'''Unrounded'''\n|'''Rounded'''\n|}\n\nAmbonese Malay do not have phonemic glottal stop /\u0294/ but phonetically the [[glottal stop]] is noticed word-initially, morpheme-initially after a vowel, and morpheme-medially between like vowels (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;24). Examples are (p.&nbsp;24): \n ''/\u2019ose/ [''\u0294''\u2019 ose] \u2018you\u2019;''\n\n ''/baku\u2019atur/ [baku#''\u0294\u2019atur] \u2018to arrange with one another\u2019\nIn addition, there might be borrowed words from other indigenous languages, there is individual variation, and [\u0294] is occasionally heard (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;24): \n ''/pa\u2019isal/ [pa''\u0294 \u2018''isal] = [pa\u2019isal]'' k.o. small proa;\n\n ''/n\u2019oul. [n\u2019o''\u0294''ul] = [n\u2019oul]'' k.o. fish \n[[Nasal vowel|Nasalised vowels]] happen expectedly before nasal consonants belonging to the same syllable. Due to this, van Minde considers nasalization as a \u201cphonetic phenomenon\u201d. He gave some examples as well (1997, pp.&nbsp;24\u201325): \n ''/\u2019aNbo''\u014b/ [\u0294\u2019''\u0101m.b\u00f5\u014b] \u2018Ambon; Ambonese\u2019;''\n\n ''/kaNp\u2019iNja\u014b/ [k\u00e3m.p\u2019\u0129\u00f1.j\u00e3\u014b] \u2018churchbell\u2019''\n\nNasalisation is invalid past syllable-boundaries like for example (p.&nbsp;24-25): \n ''/an\u2019io\u014b/ [''\u0294''a.n\u2019i.y\u00f5\u014b] \u2018rolled up cloth to support load carried on head\u2019''\n\n ''/ba#\u2019aNbur/ [ba.'' \u0294''\u2019\u0101mbur] \u2018to strew, scatter (repeatedly)''\n\n==== High front unrounded /i/ ====\nAccording to van Minde (1997, p. 25), the high front unrounded vowel /i/ is always perceived as [i], and it always take place in non-final and final closed and open syllables. /i/ in final syllables (whether they are open or closed) can be replaced by /e/ however this only applies in some polysyllabic morphemes. Though /i/ can be replaced by /e/, it does not work in reverse thus it can\u2019t be said the conflict between these two phonemes is negated in that position and environment (van Minde 1997, p. 25).\n\nBesides position and stress, further restrictions on the alternation /i \u2248 e/ is given in two [[phonological rule]]s (PR). The change in final unstressed syllables of polysyllabic morphemes is not attested in (van Minde, 1997 p. 25):<blockquote>PR<sub>1</sub>: final syllables ending in /s/;</blockquote><blockquote>PR<sub>2</sub>: open final syllables when the penultimate syllable contains /u/ or /i/</blockquote>\n\nVan Minde (1997, p. 25) regards /i/ as a \u2018heavy phoneme\u2019 wherever there is a change /i ~ e/, which means in environments that are different from those interpreted by PR<sub>1</sub> and PR<sub>2</sub>. The definition of \u2018heavy phoneme\u2019 is defined as \u201cconsists of one or more optional distinctive features in addition to the basic distinctive features, whereas a basic phoneme consists of basic distinctive features only\u201d (Ebeling 1967; Stokhof 1975). Van Minde deduces that /i/ is a heavy phoneme in environments excluded by PR<sub>1</sub> and PR<sub>2</sub>; /e/ being its basic phoneme and [relative highness] is a voluntary feature. Examples are given in the following (p.&nbsp;25):\n ''/katiNd\u2019isa\u014b/ [kat\u0129nd\u2019is\u0101\u014b] \u2018to talk or rave while sleep\u2019''\n\n ''/ir/ [\u0294ir] \u2018drunk\u2019'' \n* '''closed final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;26)''':''' \n ''/k\u2019ukis/ [k\u2019ukis *k\u2019ukes] \u2018biscuit\u2019''\n\n ''/kac\u2019il/ [kac\u2019il *kac\u2019el] \u2018small\u2019''\n* '''open final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;26)''':'''\n ''/p\u2019uti/ [p\u2019uti *p\u2019ute] \u2018white\u2019''\n\n ''/h\u2019ari \u2248 h\u2019are/ \u2018day\u2019''\n\n==== Mid front unrounded vowel /e/ ====\nThe mid front unrounded vowel /e/ is perceived as [e] (or [\u0113] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&nbsp;26): \n ''/b\u2019esi/ [b\u2019esi] \u2018iron/steel\u2019''\n\n  ''/b\u2019erkaT/ [b\u2019erkat-] \u2018divine blessing\u2019''\nThe phonemic status of /e/ versus /i/ is attested by the followed minimal pairs (p.&nbsp;26):\n ''/\u2019ina/ \u2018mother\u2019 - /\u2019ena/ \u2018tasty, delicious\u2019''\n\n ''/p\u2019ici/ \u2018to peel\u2019 - /p\u2019eci/ \u2018mud\u2019'' \nThe examples illustrated distinctly that /i/ is resistant to /e/ in morpheme-final syllables, hence the change /i \u2248 e/ in final syllables under the previous restrictions stated in the phonological rules cannot be clarified as neutralization (van Minde 1997, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327).\n\n==== Low central vowel /a/ ====\nThe low central vowel in Ambonese Malay is perceived as [a] (or [\u0101] due to nasalization). Examples are followed (p.&nbsp;27):\n ''/\u2019a\u00f1er/ [\u0294\u2019a\u00f1er] \u2018bad fishy smell\u2019''\n\n ''/kal\u2019apa/ [kal\u2019apa] \u2018coconut\u2019''\n\nThe minimal pairs attest the resistance between /a/ and /i/ (p.&nbsp;27):\n ''/s\u2019atu/ \u2018one\u2019 - /s\u2019itu/ \u2018there\u2019''\n\n ''/bal\u2019a/ \u2018to split s.t.\u2019 - /bal\u2019i/ \u2018to buy s.t.\u2019''\n\nThe opposition between /a/ and /e/ is shown by the presented minimal pairs (p.&nbsp;27):\n ''/cak\u2019a/ \u2018to strangle s.o.\u2019 - /cak\u2019e/ \u2018(vulg) to eat, stuff o.s.\u2019''\n\n ''/b\u2019aca/ \u2018to read\u2019 - /b\u2019eca/ \u2018pedicab\u2019''\n\n==== High back rounded vowel /u/ ====\n/u/ happens in non-final and final closed and open position. This high back rounded vowel is always perceived as [u] (or [\u0169] due to nasalization). However, /u/ in final unstressed syllables (whether open or closed) consistently alternates with /o/ when in certain polysyllabic morphemes (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;27). In addition, not all /o/ in this position and environment alternates with /u/, thus these two phonemes are not balanced. According to van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;27), the change /u \u2248 o/ in final unstressed syllables of polysyllabic morphemes is not proven in (p.&nbsp;27):<blockquote>PR<sub>3</sub>: open final syllables when the penultimate syllable have /u/ or /i/</blockquote>\n\nThis situation is alike to the change between the high and mid front vowels /i \u2248 e/, where /u/ is seen as a heavy phoneme, /o/ as the basic phoneme and [relative phoneme] is the optional feature. The following examples prove this assertion (p.&nbsp;28): \n ''/t\u2019obu/ [t\u2019obu] \u2248 /t\u2019obo/ [t\u2019obo] \u2018sugar cane\u2019''\n\n ''/\u2019uNpa\u014b/ [\u0294\u2019 \u0169mp\u00e3\u014b] \u2018bait\u2019''\n* '''Closed final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;28)''':'''\n ''/c\u2019aNpur \u2248 c\u2019aNpor/ \u2018to mix\u2019''\n\n ''/c\u2019abuT \u2248 c\u2019aboT/ \u2018let\u2019s go!\u2019''\n* '''Open final syllables''' (p.&nbsp;29)''':'''\n /tapar\u2019egu \u2248 tapar\u2019ego/ \u2018to do s.t. hurriedly\u2019\n\n /cap\u2019atu \u2248 cap\u2019ato/ \u2018shoe\u2019 \n* '''Minimal pairs shown to the resistance between /u/ and /i/''' (p.&nbsp;29)''':'''\n /k\u2019utu/ \u2018louse\u2019 - /k\u2019uti/ \u2018snap\u2019\n\n /g\u2019ula/ \u2018sugar\u2019 - /g\u2019ila/ \u2018mad\u2019 \n* '''The resistance between /u/ and /e/ can be shown by''' (p.&nbsp;29)''':'''\n /b\u2019ula\u014b/ \u2018moon, month\u2019- /b\u2019ela\u014b/ in: /aruNb\u2019 aI b\u2019ela\u014b/ k.o. large proa\n\n The resistance between /u/ and /a/ is attested by:\n\n /\u2019uru/ \u2018to massage\u2019 \u2013 /\u2019aru/ \u2018Aru Islands\u2019\n\n==== Mid back rounded vowel /o/ ====\nThe mid back rounded vowel /o/ is seen as [o] (or [\u00f5] due to nasalization).

This is because there is '''no opposition between /u/ and /w/ in this environment''' (p.&nbsp;31)'':'' \n ''/l\u2019aUta\u014b/ [l\u2019aut\u00e3\u014b] \u2018deep-sea\u2019''\n\nThe second reason proposed by van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;32) is that '''/U/ occurs after a consonant and directly before a stressed vowel''' (p.&nbsp;32): \n ''/bU\u2019aya/ [bu\u2019aya] \u2018crocodile\u2019''\n\nNevertheless, '''not every pattern /Cw\u2019V/ is collateral by a sequence /CU\u2019V/''' (p.&nbsp;32): \n ''/swaK/ [swak-] \u2018weak, feeble\u2019''\n\n==== Archiphoneme /I/ ====\nThis results from the neutralization of the resistance /i/-/y/ in unstressed position after a vowel or instantly before a stressed vowel (p.&nbsp;32): \n ''/m\u2019uI/ [m\u2019ui, muy] \u2018aunt\u2019'' \n* Van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;32) showed some examples of '''/I/ before a stressed vowel:''' \n ''/I\u2019a/ [I\u2019a, iy\u2019a] \u2018yes (formal)\u2019''\n\n ''/bI\u2019asa/ [bi\u2019asa] \u2018normal, usual\u2019'' \n* '''The resistance of /i/ and /y/''' is shown by (p.&nbsp;33): \n ''/t\u2019iU/ [t\u2019iyu] \u2018uncle\u2019''\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThere are '''19 [[consonant]]s phonemes''' and '''4 consonant [[archiphoneme]]s''' in Ambonese Malay and they are charted below (van Minde 1997, pp.&nbsp;40\u201341):\n\n'''<u>Consonant system</u>'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Place\n\nManner\n!Labial\n!Alveolar\n!Palatal\n!Velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n!Voice\n|<nowiki>-                              +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                              +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                               +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                                 +</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-                          +</nowiki>\n|-\n!Archiphoneme\n|              P\n|              T\n|              N\n|\n|              K\n|-\n!Stop\n|p                           b\n|t                             d\n|c                             j\n|k                               g\n|\n|-\n!Nasal\n|                 m\n|                  n\n|                 \u00f1\n|                 \u014b\n|\n|-\n!Fricative\n|f\n|s\n|\n|\n|h\n|-\n!Lateral, trill\n|\n|                l, r\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Semivowel\n|                 w\n|\n|                 y \n|\n|\n|}\n\n==== Archiphonemes /P, T, K, N/ ====\nThese archiphonemes is a consequence from the neutralization of the opposition between /p/- /b/, /t/-/d/, and /k/-/g/ respectively in two positions and under certain conditions (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;40):\n\n1.    Frequency of /P, T, K/ is especially high in word-final position. Most words with /P, T, K/ in this position are borrowed words from Dutch (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;41). This is due to the many words of Malay origin to have lost final stops *p, *t, *k, or *\u0294. Example: ''*tutup > tutu \u2018to close\u2019.''\n\nWordfinally the archiphonemes /P, T, K/ have a voiceless unreleased realization. Examples are shown (p.&nbsp;41): \n ''/keP/ [kep-] \u2018notch, nick\u2019 (<Dukeep)''\n\n ''/\u2019aNbaK/ [\u0294\u2019\u00e3mbak-] \u2018character, habit\u2019''\n\nA significant number of polysyllabic words with non-final stress have a doublet without final /P, T, K/ in non emphatic speech (p.&nbsp;41):\n ''/r\u2019unuT \u2248 runu/ \u2018fibroid material growing on palm trees\u2019''\nIn addition, van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;42) states that /P, T, K/ are \u201cheavy archiphonemes\u201d in this position and environment.\n\n2.    The archiphonemes /P, T, K/ have a voiceless unreleased realization in syllable-final position right before a stop, a nasal, fricative /s/, or the lateral /l/.

They take place word-initially and word-medially before vowels. However, in the environment of word-initially, the functional load of /\u00f1/ and /\u014b/ is low. Examples are shown (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;45): \n ''/\u00f1\u2019amu/ [\u00f1\u2019amu] \u2018mosquito\u2019''\n\n ''/\u00f1o\u014b/ [\u00f1\u00f5\u014b] \u2018term of address for boys\u2019''\nIn morpheme-final position, nasals other than /\u014b/ are barely proven and thus van Minde (1997, p.&nbsp;46) finds it hard to find minimal pairs that are different in morpheme-final nasal phoneme.\n\n==== Fricatives ====\nThe labio-dental [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] /f/ takes place only in borrowed words and in words of unknown origin. Examples are shown (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;46):\n ''/f\u2019ader/ [f\u2019ader] \u2018term of address for men\u2019''\nThe alveolar fricative /s/ happens in word-initial, -medial, and \u2013final position. Examples are shown (p.&nbsp;47): \n ''/saw\u2019aI/ [saw\u2019ai] \u2018awry\u2019''\n\n ''/rab\u2019us/ [rab\u2019us] \u2018to boil\u2019''\nThe glottal fricative /h/ takes place word-medially and word-initially. However, in the use of interjections such as /ih/ \u2018Hey!\u2019 and /ah/ \u2018Oh no!\u2019- /h/ occur word-finally (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;47) .\n\nAlso, word-medial /h/ is optional in certain words; when /h/ is removed between like vowels, one of the two adjacent vowel segments is also deleted. Examples are illustrated below (p.&nbsp;47): \n ''/bah\u2019asa/ \u2248 /basa/ \u2018language\u2019''\n\n ''/mas\u2019ohi/ \u2248 /mas\u2019oI/ \u2018mutual aid\u2019''\n\n==== Liquids ====\nThe liquids /l/ and /r/ take place in word-initial, -medial, -final position, just like the [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar fricative]] /s/. Example is shown (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;48): \n ''/t\u2019ari/ [t\u2019ari] \u2018dance\u2019''\n\n==== Semivowels ====\nThe [[semivowel]]s /w/ and /y/ happen in word-initial and word-medial position before a vowel. Example are shown below (van Minde 1997, p.&nbsp;48):\n ''/hay\u2019al/ [hay\u2019al] \u2018to flirt\u2019''\n\n ''/kal\u2019uyu/ [kal\u2019uyu] \u2018shark\u2019''\n\n== Samples ==\nExamples:\n* ''Beta pung nama Ahmad'' = My name is Ahmed\n* ''Ose su tau Ahmad pung maitua?'' = Do you know Ahmed's wife?\n* ''Jang bakudapa deng dia dolo, dia ada gagartang deng ose'' = Don't meet with him for a moment, he's angry with you.\n* ''Susi dong pung kaka mo pi kamari'' = Susi's brother will come\n* ''Ini beta kasi akang voor ose'' = This is for you.\n* ''Ale badiang jua, beta cumang mo tipu-tipu Tuang Ala'' = Shut up, I am tricking God (for joking)\n* ''Beta seng tau'' = I don't know\n\nAmbonese word samples:\n* ''Beta''\t\t   = I\n* ''Ose, Ale''\t           = you (ose is derived from the Portuguese ''voce'')\n* ''Dia''\t\t   = he, she\n* ''Akang''\t\t   = (may) it\n* ''Katong''\t           = we (cut from ''kita orang'')\n* ''Dong''\t           = they (cut from ''dia orang'')\n* ''Kamong'', ''kamorang'' = you (pl) (cut from ''kamu orang'')\n* ''Antua''\t\t   = he, she (respectful form)\n* ''iyo''\t\t   = yes\n* ''seng''\t\t   = no\n* ''bakubae''              = peace\n* ''nanaku''               = pay attention to something\n* ''su''                   = already (indicating something has already happened or has been done)\n\n== Glossing Abbreviations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|< >\n|contextual information\n|-\n|#\n|morpheme boundary\n|-\n|1S\n|first person singular\n|-\n|2S\n|second person singular\n|-\n|3S\n|third person singular\n|-\n|3Sn\n|third person singular neutral\n|-\n|Conj\n|conjunction\n|-\n|Fut\n|future aspect marker\n|-\n|Inter\n|interjection\n|-\n|Pha\n|phasal aspect marker\n|-\n|Ques\n|question particle\n|-\n|Red\n|reduplication\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[North Moluccan Malay]]\n*[[Papuan Malay]]\n*[[Serui Malay]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Ethnologue.

These developments resulted in Britain becoming the premier economies in Europe during the first half of the 19th century, the most prominent industrial power in the world economy and a major political entity. Its industrialists were major innovators in machinery such as steam engines (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, and tool-making. Britons pioneered the [[railway]] system and built many systems and sold most of the equipment other nations used.  Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. The markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the expanding [[British Empire]]. After 1840, an economic policy of [[mercantilism]] was abandoned and replaced by \"free trade,\" with few tariffs, quotas or restrictions. The powerful [[Royal Navy]] protected British interests, shipping and international trade, while the British legal system provided a system for resolving disputes relatively inexpensively, and the [[City of London]] functioned as the economic capital and focus of the world economy.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1900, [[Income per capita|economic output per head]] of the UK population rose by 50 percent (from about \u00a328 per capita to \u00a341 in 1900: an annual average increase in real incomes of 1% p.a.), growth which was associated with a significant rise in [[living standards]].<ref>Charles H.

In 1870, Britain's output per head was the second highest in the world, surpassed only by [[Economic history of Australia|Australia]]. In 1914, British income per capita was the world's third highest, exceeded only by [[Economic History of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia; these three countries shared a common economic, social and cultural heritage. In 1950, British output per head was still 30 percent above of the six founder members of the [[EEC]], but within 20 years it had been overtaken by the majority of western European economies. <ref>Lee, Clive. ''The British economy since 1700: a macroeconomic perspective'' (1986)</ref> \n\nThe response of successive British governments to this problematic performance was to seek economic growth stimuli within what became the [[European Union]]; Britain entered the [[European Community]] in 1973. Thereafter the United Kingdom's relative economic performance improved substantially to the extent that, on the eve of the 2007 crisis, British income  per capita exceeded, albeit marginally, that of [[Economic history of France|France]] and Germany; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the gap in income per capita terms between the UK and USA. This period also saw high rates of economic growth in the [[Pacific Basin]] with, first, [[economic history of Japan|Japan]] and then [[Economic history of South Korea|South Korea]] emerging as major economies as globalisation produced widespread economic development in the [[world economy]]. <ref name=\"Crafts\">{{cite book|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|title=Britain's Relative Economic Performance, 1870\u20131999|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|location=London|isbn=978-0-255-36524-6|year=1966}}</ref>\n\n==16th\u201317th centuries==\n[[File:Arms of Owen Tudor.svg|thumb|150px|Ancient coat of arms of the Tudor family.]]\nDuring 16th and 17th century many fundamental economic changes occurred, these resulted in rising incomes and paved the way to the industrialisation. After 1600, the North Sea region took over the role of the leading economic centre of Europe from the Mediterranean, which prior to this date, particularly in [[northern Italy]], had been the most highly developed part of Europe. Great Britain, together with the [[Low Countries]], profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade, Spain and Portugal, fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The export of woollen products resulted in an economic upturn with products exported to mainland Europe. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] negotiated the favourable [[Intercursus Magnus]] treaty in 1496.<ref>David M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547-1603'' p. 300.</ref>\n\nThe high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were temporary. When the population recovered, low wages and a land shortage returned.  Historians in the early 20th century characterized the economic in terms of general decline, manorial reorganization, and agricultural contraction. Later historians dropped those themes and stressed the transitions between medieval forms and Tudor progress.<ref>Michael Postan, \"Revisions in Economic History.

He described markets, ports, industries, buildings and transport links. He showed some small towns were expanding, through new commercial and industrial opportunities, especially cloth manufacture. He found other towns in decline, and suggested that investment by entrepreneurs and benefactors had enabled some small towns to prosper.<ref>John S.

The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.<ref>[[Derek Hirst]], \"Locating the 1650s in England's seventeenth century\" ''History'' (1996) 81#263 pp 359-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24423269 online]</ref>\n\n===Growth in money supply===\nSpanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World exported large quantities of silver and gold to Europe, some of which added to the English money supply. There were multiple results that all helped expand and grow the English economy, according to Dr. Nuno Palma of the University of Manchester.  The key features of the growth pattern included specialization and structural change, and increases in market participation. The new supply of specie (silver and gold) increased the money supply. Instead of  promissory notes paid off by future promissory notes, business transactions were supported by hard specie. This reduced transaction costs, increased the coverage of the market, and opened incentives and opportunities  to participate in cash transaction. Demand arose for luxury goods from Asia, such as silk and pepper, which created new upscale market demands. The increased supply of specie made tax collection easier, allowing the government to build up fiscal capacity and provide for public goods.<ref>N. Palma, \"Money and modernization in early modern England\" ''Financial History Review'' (2019), [http://www.ehes.org/EHES_147.pdf preprint EHES Working Paper No. 147, February 2019, online]</ref>\n\nVarious inflationary pressures existed; some were due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population. Inflation had a negative effect on the real wealth of most families.<ref>J. R. Wordie, \"Deflationary factors in the Tudor price rise.\" ''Past & Present'' 154 (1997): 32-70.</ref> It set the stage for social upheaval with the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with [[manorial]] lords beginning the process of [[enclosure]].<ref>Ian Dawson, ''The Tudor century'' (1993) p. 214</ref>\n\n===Exports===\n\nEspecially within the British empire, exports started to increase heavily in this period. Mostly privately-owned companies traded with the colonies in the West Indies, Northern America and India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=15\u201316|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London]] brought together [[City of London|London]]'s leading overseas merchants in a regulated company in the early 15th century, in the nature of a [[guild]].  Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) woollen [[broadcloth]].  This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.<ref>Robert Brenner, ''Merchants and revolution: commercial change, political conflict, and London's overseas traders, 1550-1653'' (Verso, 2003).</ref><ref>E.  Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1956), 2:196-268.</ref>\n\n===Wool industry===\n{{Further|Medieval English wool trade}}\nWoollen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture. The golden era of the Wiltshire woollen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woollens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.<ref>G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500-1750'' (1982).</ref><ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England: vol 2: The age of mercantilism'' (7th 1964) pp 10-92.</ref><ref>Peter J. Bowden, ''Wool Trade in Tudor and Stuart England'' (1962) [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-349-81676-7#toc online].</ref>\n\nGovernment intervention proved a disaster in the early 17th century. A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England.  Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back.  However, the trade losses became permanent.<ref>C.G.A. Clay, ''Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500-1700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government'' (1984)  pp 119-20.</ref>\n\n===Diets===\nThe diet depended largely on social class. The rich ate meat\u2014beef, pork, venison\u2014and white bread, the poor ate coarse dark bread, with a little meat perhaps at Christmas. Everyone drank ale\u2014water was often too impure to drink. Fruits and vegetables were seldom eaten. Rich spices were used by the wealthy to offset the smells of old salted meat. Vegetables and fruits were not popular. The potato was not part of the diet. The rich enjoyed desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, and crystallized fruit, and syrup.<ref>Stephen Mennell, ''All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996).</ref>\n\nAmong the rich private hospitality was an important item in the budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman.  Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known.\n\nBoth the rich and the poor had diets with nutritional deficiency. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in [[scurvy]].\n\nTrade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food.

By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  \n:we are the most \"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\"<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p 344</ref>\n\nWhile the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and Prussia's [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports soared from \u00a36.5 million in 1700, to \u00a314.7 million in 1760 and \u00a343.2 million in 1800.<ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) p 188.</ref>  Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.<ref>Eric J.

The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331 million through [[market manipulation]] and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king.  His chief minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.<ref>Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) pp 334\u201338</ref><ref>Julian Hoppit, \"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141\u2013165</ref>\n\n=== The Age of Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\nThe basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of [[mercantilism]], an economic theory that stressed maximizing the trade outside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The 18th century British Empire was based upon the preceding [[English overseas possessions]], which began to take shape in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the English settlement of islands of the [[West Indies]] such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Bahamas]], the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Bermuda]], and of Virginia, one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which in 1776 became the United States, as well as of the [[Maritime provinces]] of what is now Canada.  The sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised England's most lucrative colonies. The American colonies also used slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo, and rice in the south. England, and later Great Britain's, American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonization. Victory over the French during the [[Seven Years' War]] gave Great Britain control over what is now eastern Canada.\n\nMercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204|year=1948|page=204ff|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants&mdash;and kept others out&mdash;by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The [[Navigation Acts]] of the late 17th century provided the legal foundation for Mercantilist policy. They required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the [[Acts of Union 1707]] united Scotland with England).<ref>Darwin, 2012 p.21-22</ref> Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion-earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on Britain for their finished goods.<ref>Darwin, 2012 p. 166</ref>\n\nThe government had to fight smuggling&mdash;which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Otto Trevelyan|title=The American Revolution vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|year=1899|page=128ff}}</ref>  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R.

The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.<ref>H. R. Schubert, ''History of the British Iron and Steel Industry ... to 1775 AD'' (Routledge, 1957)</ref>\n\n=== The Industrial Revolution ===\n{{main|Industrial Revolution}}\n\nIn a period loosely dated from the 1770s to the 1820s, Britain experienced an accelerated process of economic change that transformed a largely agrarian economy into the world's first industrial economy. This phenomenon is known as the \"[[industrial revolution]]\", since the changes were far-reaching and permanent throughout many areas of Britain, especially in the developing cities.<ref>E. Anthony Wrigley, \"Reconsidering the Industrial Revolution: England and Wales.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 49.01 (2018): 9-42.</ref>\n\nEconomic, institutional, and social changes were fundamental to the emergence of the industrial revolution. Whereas absolutism remained the normal form of governance through most parts of Europe, in the UK a fundamental power balance was created after the revolutions of 1640 and 1688. The new institutional setup ensured property rights and political safety and thereby supported the emergence of an economically prosperous middle class. Another factor is the change in marriage patterns through this period. Marrying later allowed young people to acquire more education, thereby building up more human capital in the population. These changes enhanced the already relatively developed labour and financial markets, paving the way for the industrial revolution starting in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of [[iron-making]] techniques and the increased use of [[coke (fuel)|refined coal]]. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, [[turnpike trusts|improved roads]] and [[Rail transport|railways]]. Factories pulled thousands from low productivity work in agriculture to high productivity urban jobs.<ref>Redford, Arthur (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DBQNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PR5&dq=population+movement+industrial+revolution&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KIP-Tue3BIKV8gPR6LzQBQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Labour migration in England, 1800-1850\"], p. 6. Manchester University Press, Manchester.</ref>\n\nThe introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of [[water wheel]]s and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as [[industrialisation]].\n\nAccording to [[Max Weber]], the foundations of this process of change can be traced back to the Puritan Ethic of the Puritans of the 17th century.<ref>Hartmut Lehmann and Guenther Roth, eds. ''Weber's Protestant Ethic: Origins, Evidence, Contexts'' (1995)</ref>  This produced modern personalities attuned to innovation and committed to a work ethic, inspiring landed and merchant elites alive to the benefits of modernization, and a system of agriculture able to produce increasingly cheap food supplies. To this must be added the influence of religious nonconformity, which increased literacy and inculcated a \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\" amongst skilled artisans.<ref>Margaret C. Jacob, and Matthew Kadane, \"Missing, Now Found in the Eighteenth Century: Weber's Protestant Capitalist,\" ''American Historical Review,'' (Feb 2003) 108#1 pp 20-49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/533044 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nA long run of good harvests, starting in the first half of the 18th century, resulted in an increase in disposable income and a consequent rising demand for manufactured goods, particularly textiles. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] enabled wider cloth to be woven faster, but also created a demand for yarn that could not be fulfilled. Thus, the major technological advances associated with the industrial revolution were concerned with spinning. [[James Hargreaves]] created the [[Spinning Jenny]], a device that could perform the work of a number of spinning wheels. However, while this invention could be operated by hand, the [[water frame]], invented by [[Richard Arkwright]], could be powered by a [[water wheel]]. Indeed, Arkwright is credited with the widespread introduction of the [[factory system]] in Britain, and is the first example of the successful mill owner and industrialist in British history. The water frame was, however, soon supplanted by the [[spinning mule]] (a cross between a water frame and a jenny) invented by [[Samuel Crompton]]. Mules were later constructed in iron by Messrs. Horrocks of Stockport.\n\nAs they were water powered, the first mills were constructed in rural locations by streams or rivers. Workers villages were created around them, such as [[New Lanark]] Mills in Scotland. These spinning mills resulted in the decline of the [[domestic system]], in which spinning with old slow equipment was undertaken in rural cottages.\n\nThe [[steam engine]] was invented and became a power supply that soon surpassed waterfalls and horsepower. The first practicable steam engine was invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]], and was used for pumping water out of mines. A much more powerful steam engine was invented by [[James Watt]]; it had a [[reciprocating engine]] capable of powering machinery. The first steam-driven textile mills began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, and this transformed the industrial revolution into an urban phenomenon, greatly contributing to the appearance and rapid growth of industrial towns.\n\nThe progress of the textile trade soon outstripped the original supplies of raw materials. By the turn of the 19th century, imported American cotton had replaced wool in the [[North West of England]], though wool remained the chief textile in [[Yorkshire]]. Textiles have been identified as the catalyst in technological change in this period. The application of steam power stimulated the demand for coal; the demand for machinery and rails stimulated the [[iron industry]]; and the demand for transportation to move raw material in and finished products out stimulated the growth of the canal system, and (after 1830) the railway system.\n\nSuch an unprecedented degree of economic growth was not sustained by domestic demand alone. The application of technology and the factory system created such levels of [[mass production]] and cost efficiency that enabled British manufacturers to export inexpensive cloth and other items worldwide.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] has posited the 1790s as the \"take-off\" period for the industrial revolution. This means that a process previously responding to domestic and other external stimuli began to feed upon itself, and became an unstoppable and irreversible process of sustained industrial and technological expansion.\n\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th century a series of technological advances led to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Britain's position as the world's pre-eminent trader helped fund research and experimentation. The nation also had some of the world's greatest reserves of [[coal]], the main fuel of the new revolution.\n\nIt was also fuelled by a rejection of mercantilism in favour of the predominance of [[Adam Smith]]'s [[capitalism]]. The fight against Mercantilism was led by a number of [[liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, such as [[Richard Cobden]], [[Joseph Hume]], [[Francis Place]] and [[John Roebuck]].\n\nSome have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British [[slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slave trade and the [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations provided less than 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513025327/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Industrial Revolution saw a rapid transformation in the British economy and society. Previously, large industries had to be near forests or rivers for power. The use of coal-fuelled engines allowed them to be placed in large urban centres. These new factories proved far more efficient at producing goods than the [[cottage industry]] of a previous era. These manufactured goods were sold around the world, and raw materials and luxury goods were imported to Britain.\n\n===Empire===\n{{main|British Empire|Historiography of the British Empire}}\nDuring the Industrial Revolution the empire became less important and less well-regarded. The British defeat in the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783) deprived it of its largest and most developed colonies. This loss brought a realisation that colonies were not particularly economically beneficial to the home economy.<ref>Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997'' (2010)</ref>  It was realised that the costs of occupation of colonies often exceeded the financial return to the taxpayer. In other words, formal empire afforded no great economic benefit when trade would continue whether the overseas political entities were nominally sovereign or not. The American Revolution helped demonstrate this by showing that Britain could still control trade with the colonies without having to pay for their defence and governance. Capitalism encouraged the British to grant their colonies self-government, starting with [[History of Canada|Canada]], which became unified and largely independent in 1867, and [[History of Australia|Australia]], which followed suit in 1901.<ref>Peter Cain and Tony Hopkins. ''British Imperialism: 1688-2000'' (2nd ed. 2001)</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\nCritical to British success in confronting Napoleon was its superior economic situation. It was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France.  With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers \u2013 economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref>\n\nMost important, the British national output remained strong. Textiles and iron grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared\u2014it was a golden age for agriculture even as food shortages appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the food shortages of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate food shortages.<ref>Roger Wells, \"The revolt of the south-west, 1800-1801: a study in English popular protest,\" ''Social History'' (1977) #6 pp 713-744.</ref>  Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 162-4</ref>\n\nThe system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The well-organized business sector channelled products into what the military needed. Not only did British cloth provide for British uniforms, it clothed the allies as well and indeed the French soldiers too. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.<ref>Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 143, 162</ref>\n\n[[File:Dette britannique longue p\u00e9riode.png|thumb|The [[national debt]] of the United Kingdom was at a record high percentage of the GDP as the Napoleonic wars ended, but was largely repaid by 1914.]]\nThe British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366 million, including \u00a310 million for the Navy, \u00a340 million for the Army, \u00a310 million for the Allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt.

The economy was not damaged by the diversion of manpower to the army and navy; in terms of destruction and enforced transfer of national wealth, Britain came out ahead. British control of the oceans proved optimal in creating a liberal free-trade global economy, and helped Britain gain the lion's share of the world's carrying trade and financial support services. The effects were positive for agriculture and most industries, apart from construction. The rate of capital formation was slowed somewhat and national income perhaps would have grown even faster without war. The most negative impact was a drop in living standards for the urban working classes.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, \"The Impact of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, on the Long-Run Growth of the British Economy,\" ''Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center'' (1989) 12#3 pp 335-395.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n19th century Britain was the world's richest and most advanced economy.

The article helped launch the [[Cambridge School of historiography]]. Gallagher and Robinson used the British experience to construct a framework for understanding European imperialism that swept away the all-or-nothing thinking of previous historians.<ref>R. E. Robinson and John Gallagher, ''Africa and the Victorians: The official mind of imperialism'' (1966).</ref>  They found that European leaders rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" had to be based upon formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal influence in independent areas.  According to Wm.patrick santian at mesita elementary\n historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'\"<ref>Wm. Roger Louis, ''Imperialism'' (1976) p. 4.</ref>  Oron Hale said  that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they, \"found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion.

Ireland, where the population was heavily dependent on potatoes for subsistence, was the worst affected.

This emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal. Domestic consumption in household heaths remained an important market though coal also fired the new steam engines installed in textile factories.  Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system.  In 1815, [[George Stephenson]] invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways ''system'' in 1825 by opening the [[Stockton and Darlington]] line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building\u2014a veritable bubble, but one with permanent value. [[Thomas Brassey]] brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model.  Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges. The telegraph, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways because it allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through. Telegraphs made it possible to use a single track for two-way traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914. The boom years were 1836 and 1845\u201347, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of \u00a3200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices.\n[[File:George Hudson - Project Gutenberg eText 17293.jpg|200px|thumb|[[George Hudson]]]]\n\n[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806\u20131859) designed the first major railway, the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]], built originally in the 1830s to cover the 100 miles from London to Bristol. Even more important was the highly controversial [[George Hudson]]. He became Britain's \"railway king\" by merging numerous short lines.<ref>A. J. Arnold, and S. McCartney, ''George Hudson: The Rise and Fall of the Railway King'' (2004)</ref>  Since there was no government agency supervising the railways, Hudson set up a system that all the lines adopted called the [[Railway Clearing House]]. It made interconnections easy for people and freight by standardizing routines for transferring freight and people between companies, and loaning out freight cars. By 1849 Hudson controlled nearly 30% of Britain's trackage. Hudson did away with accountants and manipulated funds\u2014paying large dividends out of capital because profits were quite low, but no one knew that until his system collapsed and the railway bubble of the late 1840s burst.<ref>Adrian Vaughan, ''Railwaymen, Politics and Money: The Great Age of Railways in Britain'' (1997) pp 102-12</ref>\n\n[[File:Euston Station showing wrought iron roof of 1837.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Euston railway station|Euston station in London]], 1837. Note the open passenger carriages]]\n\nBy 1850 Britain had a well integrated, well engineered system that provided fast, on-time, inexpensive movement of freight and people to every city and most rural districts. Freight rates had plunged to a penny a ton mile for coal.  The system directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, conductors, mechanics, repairmen, accountants, station agents and managers, bringing a new level of business sophistication that could be applied to many other industries, and helping many small and large businesses to expand their role in the industrial revolution. Thus railways had a tremendous impact on industrialization. By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railway system itself. The system kept growing; by 1880, there were 13,500 locomotives which each carried 97,800 passengers a year, or 31,500 tons of freight.<ref>[[Jack Simmons (historian)|Jack Simmons]] and Gordon Biddle, ''The Oxford Companion to British Railway History: From 1603 to the 1990s'' (1999)</ref>\n\n=== Second Industrial Revolution ===\n{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|thumb]]\n[[File:graph rel lvl indz 1750 1900 01.png|thumb]]\nDuring the First Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as the dominant figure in the capitalist system. In the later decades of the 19th century, when the ultimate control and direction of large industry came into the hands of financiers, industrial capitalism gave way to [[financial capitalism]] and the corporation. The establishment of behemoth industrial empires, whose assets were controlled and managed by men divorced from production, was a dominant feature of this third phase. By the middle of the 19th century, as the world's only fully industrialized nation, British output represented just under half the total of the world's industrial capacity.<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/>\n\nNew products and services were also introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap iron (and after 1870 steel) meant that slow, sailing ships could be replaced with [[steamship]]s, such as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] ''[[SS Great Western]]''. Electricity and [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries became important although Britain lagged behind the U.S. and Germany.\n\nAmalgamation of industrial [[cartel]]s into larger corporations, mergers and alliances of separate firms, and technological advancement (particularly the increased use of electric power and [[internal combustion engine]]s fuelled by gasoline) were mixed blessings for British business during the late [[Victorian era]]. The ensuing development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873-1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &mdash; and falling &mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.\n\nBy the 1870s, financial houses in London had achieved an unprecedented level of control over industry. This contributed to increasing concerns among policy-makers over the protection of British investments overseas &mdash; particularly those in the securities of foreign governments and in foreign-government-backed development activities, such as railways. Although it had been official British policy to support such investments, with the large expansion of these investments in the 1860s, and the economic and political instability of many areas of investment (such as [[Egypt]]), calls upon the government for methodical protection became increasingly pronounced in the years leading up to the Crystal Palace Speech. At the end of the [[Victorian era]], the [[service sector]] (banking, insurance and shipping, for example) began to gain prominence at the expense of manufacturing. During the late 18th century the United Kingdom experienced stronger increases in the service sector than in the industrial sector; industry grew by only 2 percent, whereas the service sector employment increased by 9 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Cargo Fleet set high production goals and developed an innovative but complicated accounting system to measure and report all costs throughout the production process.

The crown jewel was India, where in the 1750s a private British company, with its own army, the [[East India Company]] (or \"John Company\"), took control of parts of India. The 19th century saw Company rule extended across India after expelling the Dutch, French and Portuguese. By the 1830s the Company was a government and had given up most of its business in India, but it was still privately owned. Following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] the government closed down the Company and took control of [[British India]] and the Company's [[Presidency Armies]].<ref>Lawrence James, ''Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India'' (2000)</ref>\n\nFree trade (with no tariffs and few trade barriers) was introduced in the 1840s. Protected by the overwhelming power of the Royal Navy, the economic empire included very close economic ties with independent nations in Latin America. The informal economic empire has been called \"[[The Imperialism of Free Trade]].\"<ref>John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson. \"The Imperialism of Free Trade,\" ''Economic History Review'' (August 1953) 6#1 pp 1\u201315 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2591017 in JSTOR]</ref>\n[[File:Victoria Dock, Tanjong Pagar, in the 1890s.jpg|thumb|Singapore docks in the 1890s.]]\n\nNumerous independent entrepreneurs expanded the Empire, such as [[Stamford Raffles]] of the East India Company who founded the port of [[History of Singapore|Singapore]] in 1819. Businessmen eager to sell Indian opium in the vast China market led to the Opium War (1839\u20131842) and the establishment of British colonies at [[History of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. One adventurer, [[James Brooke]], set himself up as the Rajah of the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]] in North Borneo in 1842; his realm joined the Empire in 1888. [[Cecil Rhodes]] set up an economic empire of diamonds in South Africa that proved highly profitable. There were great riches in gold as well but this venture led to expensive wars with the [[Second Boer War|Dutch settlers known as Boers]].\n\nThe possessions of the East India Company in India, under the direct rule of the Crown from 1857 \u2014known as British India\u2014 was the centrepiece of the Empire, and because of an efficient taxation system it paid its own administrative expenses as well as the cost of the large [[British Indian Army]].

To protect the canal, Britain expanded further, taking control of Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Cyprus, Palestine, Aden, and British Somaliland.  None were especially profitable until the discovery of oil in the Middle East after 1920.  Some military action was involved, and from time to time there was a risk of conflict with other imperial powers seeking the same territory, as in the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898.  All the incidents were resolved peacefully.\n\nCain and Hopkins argue that the phases of expansion abroad were closely linked with the development of the domestic economy. Therefore, the shifting balance of social and political forces under imperialism and the varying intensity of Britain's economic and political rivalry with other powers need to be understood with reference to domestic policies. Gentlemen capitalists, representing Britain's landed gentry and London's service sectors and financial institutions, largely shaped and controlled Britain's imperial enterprises in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Industrial leaders played a lesser role and found themselves dependent on the gentlemen capitalists.<ref>P. J. Cain and A. G. Hopkins, \"Gentlemanly Capitalism and British Expansion Overseas I.

The bursting of a railroad speculation bubble in the United States, heavily financed via London, was a major factor in the initial shock. British foreign investment fell sharply, but it took some years for record high domestic investments to fall as well. The initial Depression lasted between 1873-1879, and was marked above all by price [[deflation]], and therefore declining profitability for industrialists and financiers. Shrinking returns and a generally unfavorable economic climate meant that investment as a percentage of Britain's [[National wealth]], both overseas and at home, fell from an average of 12.6% between 1870\u201374, to 9.7% between 1875-1896.<ref>Musson, 1959; p. 211</ref> The sluggish world market, which was at its weakest in the 1880s, was keenly felt in the export-reliant economy of the UK.

There were no severe depressions and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate, manufacturing output, and GDP (but not per capita) fell behind its rivals the United States, and Germany.

Although the relative contribution of the agricultural sector was becoming less important, productivity in the British agriculture sector was relatively high. \n\nBy international standards, and across all sectors of the United Kingdom, the British services sectors exhibited high labour factor productivity and, especially, total factor productivity; as was to be even more the case one hundred years later, it was the services sectors that provided the British economy's relative advantage in 1900. \n\nIt has been suggested that the industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and that there was a striking preference for leisure over industrial entrepreneurship among the elite. In 1910, the British share of world industrial capacity stood at 15%, just behind Germany's 16%, and less than half of the United States' 35%.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Despite signs of relative weakness in certain sectors of the UK economy, the major achievements of the Edwardian years should be underlined.

The total of lost shipping came to 7.9 million tons (much of it replaced by new construction), and \u00a37,500 million in financial costs to the Empire.

The diversion of shipping and production towards the war effort between 1914 and 1918 meant that regional producers like the United States in Latin America or Japan in the Far East usurped important markets for British goods.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/> Britain never regained its pre-1914 export volumes, by 1929 exports were still only 80% of what they had been in 1913.<ref>{{Cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump| author=Carter & Mears| year=2011| p=160}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, even if Britain was far better off compared to the badly battered Continent, economic stagnation lasted the whole decade.<ref>N. K. Buxton, \"Economic growth in Scotland between the Wars: the role of production structure and rationalization\", ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 1980) 33#4 pp. 538-55.</ref> Overall growth averaged 1.8% per annum during the 1920s, slightly weaker but comparable to the United States.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/> Slow growth was due in part to Britain's heavy dependence on exports, and world trade grew sluggishly through the 1920s.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/> It was also overly dependent on so-called \"staple\" industries, those which had brought huge prosperity in the 19th century but by the 1920s were experiencing faltering demand and strong competition from abroad. In 1922, for example, the volume of cotton exports was only about half of what it had been in 1913, while coal exports were only one third of their 1913 levels.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/> The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.<ref>A. J. Robertson, \"Clydeside revisited: A reconsideration of the Clyde shipbuilding industry 1919-1938\" in W. H. Chaloner and B. M. Ratcliffe, eds., ''Trade and Transport: Essays in Economic History in Honour of T. S. Willan'' (Manchester University Press, 1977), pp. 258-78.</ref> In depressed areas the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.<ref>R. J. Finlay, \"National identity in crisis: politicians, intellectuals and the 'end of Scotland', 1920-1939,\" ''History,'' June 1994, vol. 79, (256), pp. 242-59.</ref>\n\n===Productivity & Employment===\nIn 1919, Britain reduced the working hours in major industries to a 48-hour week for industrial workers. Historians have debated whether this move depressed labour productivity and contributed to the slump. Scott and Spadavecchia argue that productivity was in some ways enhanced, especially through higher hourly productivity, and that Britain did not suffer in its exports because most other nations also reduced working hours. Looking at coal, cotton, and iron and steel, they find that Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries.<ref>Peter Scott and Anna Spadavecchia, \"Did the 48-hour week damage Britain's industrial competitiveness?,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 2011) 64#4 pp 1266-1288</ref> By 1924 workers had regained their productive output of 1913, this while working greatly reduced hours compared to the pre-war years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump| author=Carter & Mears| year=2011| p=155}}</ref> By 1938 British industrial productivity had increased by 75% compared to pre-1914 levels, even after the setbacks of reduced working hours and the effects of the Great Depression were taken into account.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMonetary policy of postwar governments also contributed to high unemployment. By April 1925, years of stringent [[deflation]]ary policies by the British Exchequer had accomplished the intended goal of returning the Pound Sterling to its pre-war exchange rate of $4.86. This high exchange rate made for cheap consumer prices and a high [[Real wages|real wage]] for UK workers. However, interest rates were also high as a result, making the cost of doing business all the more expensive, while high labour costs were inevitably offset by employers with layoffs and reduced hiring.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/research/floudjohnsonchaptersep16-03.pdf| title=The British Economy Between the Wars| author=Barry Eichengreen| publisher=eml.berkeley.edu| year=2002| p=20}}</ref>\n\nBy 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. While the economy was recovering by 1922\u20131923, the UK found itself struggling again by 1926, the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]] of that year doing it no favours. Growth for the remainder of the decade became erratic, with brief periods of stagnation constantly interrupting growth. Industrial relations briefly improved, but then came the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street stock market crash]] in October 1929, which sparked the worldwide [[Great Depression]] (See the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jakesimpkin.org/ArticlesResearch/GreatBritain19001950/tabid/93/Default.aspx|title=Jake Simpkin - Local Historian & Guide > Home|work=jakesimpkin.org|access-date=29 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141229/http://www.jakesimpkin.org/ArticlesResearch/GreatBritain19001950/tabid/93/Default.aspx|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Unemployment had stood at less than 1.8 million at the end of 1930, but by the end of 1931 it had risen sharply to more than 2.6 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/24/stock-market-unemployment-1931 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Research | last=Department | title=1931:The spectre of mass unemployment haunts the UK | date=24 May 2011}}</ref> By January 1933, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed, accounting for more than 20% of the workforce - with unemployment topping 50% in some parts of the country, particularly in [[South Wales]] and the north-east of [[England]].

In 1880, Britain produced 1.3 million tons of steel, and in 1893 3 million tons; by 1914 output was 8 million tons. Germany caught up in 1893 and produced 14 million tons in 1914.<ref>B. R.

The industry made significant technical advances in terms of vanadium, phospho-magnetic steels and other specialized high-strength alloys, using the electric furnace and other innovations, the devising of new techniques over the smoke issue. The industry trained a cadre of experts that made large firms scientifically self-sustaining.<ref>Michael Sanderson, \"The Professor as Industrial Consultant: Oliver Arnold and the British Steel Industry, 1900-14,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 1978) 31#4 pp 585-600</ref>\n\n===Coal===\nPolitics became a central issue for the coal miners, whose organization was facilitated by their location in remote one-industry villages. The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] formed in 1888, and counted 600,000 members in 1908. Much of the 'old left' of Labour politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas.<ref>Vic Allen, ''The militancy of British miners'' (1981).</ref>\n\n====General Strike of 1926====\n{{main|General Strike of 1926}}\nIn April 1926 the owners locked out the miners because they had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices caused by demand as oil started to replace coal.<ref>W.N. Medlicott, ''Contemporary England, 1914-1964'' (2nd ed. 1967) pp 223-30</ref> The general strike was led by the TUC for the benefit of coal miners, but it failed.  It was a nine-day nationwide walkout of one million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers supporting the 1.5 million coal miners who had been locked out. The government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. The TUC hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history and TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.<ref>Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \"The General Strike, 1926,\" Historical Journal (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001-1012 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638422 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], \"The General Strike,\" ''[[History Today]]'' (2006) 56#5 pp 40-47</ref> The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946.\n\nCoal continued as a sick industry as the best seams were used up and it became more and more difficult to mine the rest. The Labour government in 1947 nationalized coal into the National Coal Board, giving miners access to control of the mines via their control of the Labour party and the government.<ref>Ben Fine, ''The Coal Question: Political Economy and Industrial Change from the Nineteenth Century to the Present Day''  (1990).</ref> By then, however, the best seams had played out and coal mining was headed downward.  Coal production was 50 million metric tons in 1850, 149 million in 1880, 269 million in 1910, 228 million in 1940, and 153 million in 1970.  The peak year was 1913, with an output of 292 million tons. Mining employed 383,000 men in 1851, 604,000 in 1881, and 1,202,000 in 1911.<ref>B. R. Mitchell, ''European Historical Statistics'' (1975) pp 361-8, 163</ref>\n\n===New Industries===\nWhile Britain remained overly dependent on 'staple' heavy industries, the First World War had the advantage of stimulating production in new industries where the UK had lagged behind before 1914. Several of the new industries, including motorcars, chemicals, and rayon, were early recipients of tariff protection in the 1920s, prior to the [[Import Duties Act 1932]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varian|first=Brian D.|title=The growth of manufacturing protection in 1920s Britain|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=0|issue=5|pages=703\u2013711|doi=10.1111/sjpe.12223|issn=1467-9485|year=2019}}</ref> The interwar years saw new technologies develop at a breakneck pace, creating lucrative new industries including automobile, airplane, and motorbike manufacture. Before the First World War, automobile manufacture in Britain had been a boutique industry limited to producing expensive luxury cars. The industry produced 34,000 vehicles for the year 1913; by 1937 over half a million were being produced.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=155}}</ref> Most of these were affordable models like the [[Austin 7]] (introduced 1921), the [[Morris Minor (1928)|Morris Minor]] (1928), as well as Model A and [[Ford Model Y|Model Y]] cars produced by [[Ford of Britain]]. The adoption of streamlined automation processes and the strong competition between manufacturers was responsible for a 50% drop in motorcar prices between the mid 20s and mid 30s, making cars more affordable (over 1 million were owned by 1930).<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain| author=Kenneth O. Morgan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2009| p=541}}</ref>\n\nThe chemicals industry, once dominated by Germany and the United States, also thrived in the UK during the interwar years. By 1939 it employed 100,000 people and produced fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=157}}</ref> Electrical engineering also mushroomed: the establishment of the [[Central Electricity Board]] in 1926 enabled a nationwide high-voltage electrical grid to be developed. By 1939 two thirds of homes had electricity supply, which in turn opened up a new consumer market for electrically powered appliances like vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, radios and stoves.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=155}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1923 and 1938, the most successful new industries were: automobile production, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, metal goods, and printing. These created a net total of 557,920 new jobs between 1923 and 1938, some 96% of all new industrial jobs created in the interwar period.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\">{{cite article| url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020859000000249| title=Women, Other ''Fresh'' Workers, and the New Manufacturing Workforce of Interwar Britain| publisher=International Review of Social History |volume= 45| year=2000| p=456}}</ref> These industries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the communities surrounding London and cities in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], particularly [[Coventry, England|Coventry]] and Birmingham, where there was an established workforce skilled in the production of high quality metal goods.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\"/>\n\n===1920s \"consumer boom\"===\nIn spite of the serious problems that plagued heavy industry, the 1920s marked an era of unprecedented growth for the British consumer industry, until then a minor player in the national economy. While not creating a fully-fledged \"consumer culture\" as in the United States during the same decade, it had an important effect over British society, primarily on the middle classes which gained access to commodities previously reserved for the upper crust, primarily automobiles, ownership rising tenfold during the interwar period (from around 500,000 in 1919 to approximately over 3 million in 1929 and 5 million in 1939). Sales of electric appliances boomed thanks to the rise of consumer-oriented credit and loans. Higher wages and shorter working hours also led to the rise of recreation: Gramophone records, radio (or \"the wireless\" as it was referred), magazines and cinema became part of everyday life much like sports, primarily football and cricket.\n\nTourism grew rapidly in the interwar years because of the rapidly rising number of motorized middle-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers, as well as an influx of American tourists. Seaside resorts like [[Blackpool]], [[Brighton]] and [[Skegness]] were particularly popular. However, those tourist sites that catered to the very wealthy (which now began holidaying abroad) or were located in depressed areas, all experienced a decline in profits, especially during the Great Depression.<ref>Rex Pope, \"A Consumer Service in Interwar Britain: The Hotel Trade, 1924-1938,\" ''Business History Review,'' (Winter 2000) 74#4 pp 657-82</ref>\n\nElectricity, gas, plumbing and telephone services became common as well during the decade, even in some working class households. However, those living in the most remote and poorest parts of Britain saw little change in their living standards, with many Britons still living in terraced homes with outdoor toilets as late as the 1960s.\n\n===1929\u20131939: the Great Depression===\n{{main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]\nWhile the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall St Crash]] of 1929 had little direct impact on the British stock market, the collapse of the American economy which it had foretold and the associated contraction of world trade seriously affected Britain in the early 1930s.  Whereas British politicians had championed the concept of the free market when it was ascendant in the world economy, it gradually withdrew to adopting [[Tariff Reform]] as a measure of protectionism. In 1933 Sterling left the [[Gold Standard]]. By the early 1930s, the depression again signalled the economic problems the British economy faced. Unemployment soared during this period; from just over 10% in 1929 to more than 20% (or more than 3 million of the workforce) by early 1933. However, it had fallen to 13.9% by the start of 1936. While heavy industry sank to new lows, the consumer industry recovered by 1934 and production increased by 32% between 1933 and 1937. A good indication of the strong consumer market was the growth of retailers during the 1930s. [[Marks & Spencer]], for example, increased its turnover from \u00a32.5 million in 1929 to over \u00a325 million in 1939, necessitating the opening of dozens of new locations to serve the burgeoning demand in the suburbs.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/>\n\nIn 1929 [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed his second minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government. In political terms, the economic problems found expression in the rise of radical movements who promised solutions which conventional political parties appeared unable to provide. In Britain this was seen with the rise of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and the Fascists under [[Oswald Mosley]]. However, their political strength was limited and unlike in the rest of Europe, the conventional political parties did not face a significant challenge. In 1931 the Labour Government resigned having failed to agree cuts in national expenditure, disagreeing over the extent of cuts in welfare payments, to be [[National_Government_(1931)|replaced]] by a McDonald-led [[National_Government_(United_Kingdom)|National Government]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], which provided the majority of its MPs, was returned to power in 1935.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Further|United Kingdom home front during World War II}}\nIn the [[Second World War]], 1939\u201345, Britain had a highly successful record of mobilising the [[home front]] for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.<ref>Robin Havers, ''The Second World War: Europe, 1939-1943'' (2002) Volume 4, p 75</ref>  Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.<ref>W.K.

In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the war effort, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.<ref>Peter Howlett, \"Resource allocation in wartime Britain: The case of steel, 1939-45,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' (July 1994) 29#3 pp 523-44</ref> Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure.  The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940\u2014more than enough to cover the losses\u2014and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.<ref>Postan (1952), Chapter 4.</ref>  Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion<ref>Hancock, ''British War Economy'' [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-Stats-3.html online p 353]</ref>\n\nAfter war broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, Britain imposed [[exchange controls]]. The British Government used its [[gold reserves]] and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in early 1941 enacted [[Lend-Lease]], whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which never had to be repaid.<ref>There were some exceptions and $650 million was repaid.

The Labour government chose not to use the $2.7 billion (Germany received $1.7b) in aid for industrial modernization like Germany had. \nGermany rebuilt factories like the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg. Germany, France and Italy were fully re-engineered with all electric rail lines.  In Britain, steam engines, mechanical semaphore signalling and old track would remain into the 1960s. In addition, the road and telecommunications network in Britain remained equally inadequate, ill-maintained and out-of-date.\n\nBy 1950-1 the UK still spent 7.7% of GNP on defence while Germany and Japan spent nothing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Correlli |title=The Wasting of Britain's Marshall Aid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml |website=BBC History |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], just after the end of the war in Europe, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Clement Attlee]] was elected with a landslide majority (its first ever outright majority), introducing sweeping reforms of the British economy.

The economy went from strength to strength particularly after the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, still led by wartime leader [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] until he retired to make way for [[Anthony Eden]] just before his party's [[1955 United Kingdom general election|re-election in 1955]]. However, the Suez crisis of 1956 weakened the government's reputation and Britain's global standing, and prompted Eden to resign in early 1957 to be replaced by [[Harold Macmillan]].\n\nBy 1959, tax cuts had helped boost living standards and allow for a strong economy<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393287.stm|work=BBC News|title=1959: Macmillan wins Tory hat trick|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> and low unemployment, with October 1959 seeing the Tories win their third consecutive general election with a greatly increased majority, which sparked public and media doubt regarding Labour's chances of future election success.<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/unemployment|title=Unemployment|work=politics.co.uk}}</ref> Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell then drew a new economic plan for the party, heavily based on the success of the centralised industries of France and West Germany, by the 1960s the latter's economy surpassing the UK for the first time since 1915 as Europe's largest economy. Harold Wilson and Anthony Wedgwood Benn further developed the idea, becoming the backbone of the party's manifesto for the 1964 election.\n\nBritain's economy remained strong with low unemployment into the 1960s, but towards the end of the decade this growth began to slow and unemployment was rising again. [[Harold Wilson]], the Labour leader who had ended 13 years of Conservative rule with a narrow victory in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] before increasing his majority in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]], was surprisingly voted out of power in [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. The new Conservative government was led by [[Edward Heath]].\n\nDuring the 1970s Britain suffered a long running period of relative economic malaise, dogged by rising unemployment, frequent strikes and severe inflation, with neither the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]-[[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]] (led by [[Edward Heath]]) nor the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government which succeeded it (led by [[Harold Wilson]] and from 1976 [[James Callaghan]]) being able to halt the country's economic decline. Inflation exceeded 20% twice during the 1970s and was rarely below 10%.\n\nUnemployment exceeded 1 million by 1972 and had risen even higher by the time the end of the decade was in sight, passing the 1.5 million mark in 1978. The winter of 1978/79 brought a series of public sector strikes known as the [[Winter of Discontent]], leading to the collapse of Callaghan's Labour government in March 1979 (two years after it had lost the three-seat parliamentary majority won in October 1974).<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\"/>\n\nThis led to the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975. She cut back on the government's role in the economy and weakened the power of the [[trade union]]s. The final two decades of the 20th century saw an increase in service-providers and a drop in manufacturing and heavy industry, combined with [[privatisation]] of some sections of the economy. This change has led some to describe this as a 'Third Industrial Revolution', though this term is not widely used.\n\n===1945\u20131951: Age of Austerity===\nAfter the end of World War II, the British economy had again lost huge amounts of absolute wealth. Its economy was driven entirely for the needs of war and took some time to be reorganised for peaceful production. Britain's economic position was relatively strong compared to its devastated European neighbors - in 1947 British exports were equivalent in value to the combined exports of [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> Anticipating the end of the conflict, the [[United States]] had negotiated throughout the war to liberalise post-war trade and the international flow of capital in order to break into markets which had previously been closed to it, including the British Empire's [[Sterling area|Pound Sterling bloc]]. This was to be realised through the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941, through the establishment of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1944, and through the new economic power that the US was able to exert due to the weakened British economy.\n\n[[File:Winter 1947, snowbound bus, Castle Hill, Huddersfield - geograph.org.uk - 1668518.jpg|thumb|A snowbound bus in [[Huddersfield]], during the record-cold winter of 1946-47, which caused major fuel shortages and damaged Britain's fragile post-war economic recovery]]\nImmediately after the war in the Pacific ended, the U.S. halted [[Lend-Lease]], but did give the UK a [[Anglo-American loan|long-term low-interest loan of US$4.33bn]]. The winter of [[Winter of 1946-47 in the United Kingdom|1946\u20131947]] proved to be very harsh, with curtailed production and shortages of coal, which again affected the economy so that by August 1947, when convertibility was due to begin, the economy was not as strong as it needed to be. When the Labour Government enacted convertibility, there was a run on Sterling, as pounds were traded for dollars. This damaged the British economy and within weeks convertibility was abandoned. By 1949, the British pound was seen to be over valued and had to be devalued. The US dollar had become the world's premier currency.\n\nThe major economic priority of post-war Britain was to raise exports to fund he UK's dollar deficit. This required the extension of rationing, as British goods and produce were prioritized for export markets. Unlike Continental European countries, where rationing was abandoned within a few years of the wars' end, Britain actually tightened rationing restrictions and didn't fully abandon them until 1954.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> The U.S. began [[Marshall Plan]] grants (mostly grants with a few loans) that pumped $3.3 billion into the economy and encouraged businessmen to modernize their approach to management.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947-1952'' (1989)</ref> Marshall Aid, however, failed to have the desired effect of modernizing industry and stimulating the economy, because 97% of the funds were used to service British debt repayments. This left the UK at a comparative disadvantage to rivals like [[France]] and [[West Germany]], who were able to invest the money directly into industry and infrastructure, creating more competitive, efficient economies in the long-term.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref>\n\n===Nationalisation===\nThe Labour Governments of 1945\u20131951 enacted a political programme rooted in [[collectivism]] that included the [[nationalisation]] of industries and state direction of the economy. Both wars had demonstrated the possible benefits of greater state involvement. This underlined the future direction of the post-war economy, and was also supported in the main by the Conservatives. However, the initial hopes for nationalisation were not fulfilled and more nuanced understandings of economic management emerged, such as state direction, rather than state ownership. With the extensive nationalisation programme achieved, Keynesian management of the UK economy was adopted.\n\nWith the postwar Labour Governments, the first comprehensive attempts at economic planning were made with initiatives intended to overhaul chronically depressed regions of the UK. The [[Distribution of Industry Act 1945]] designated \"development areas\" in northeast England, Scotland, and Wales according to the findings of the Barlow Report of 1940, which had recommended a complete economic overhaul of the troubled areas it pinpointed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|author=Kenneth O. Morgan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2009| p=562\u2013563}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, the British government pumped some \u00a3300 million into the building of 481 new factories in these regions, to be leased to private industry. In addition there were 505 privately owned factories built in the troubled regions on the active encouragement of the government in London. This activity created an estimated 200,000 new jobs.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/tradeindustry/industrycommunity/overview/afterworldwar/| title=Programming redevelopment after World War II| author=parliament.uk| publisher=www.parliament.uk| access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of nationalizing the coal mines had been accepted in principle by owners and miners alike before the elections of 1945. The owners were paid \u00a3165,000,000. The government set up the [[National Coal Board]] to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it \u00a3150,000,000 to modernize the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945, there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 as they had been in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 it was clear that the country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with stock piles of 5 million tons too low. Nationalization exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.<ref>Mark Tookey,  \"Three's a Crowd?

Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. Unemployment was relatively low during this period, and the standard of living continued to rise, with more new private and council housing developments and the number of slum properties diminishing. Churchill and the Conservatives were back in power following the 1951 elections, but they largely continued the welfare state policies as set out by the Labour Party in the late 1940s.\n\n[[File:Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (14998200805).jpg|thumb|[[Butlins]] holiday camp in [[Pwllheli]], Wales in the 1950s. Holiday camps symbolized the newfound prosperity and leisure of postwar Britain]]\nDuring the \"golden age\" of the 1950s and 1960s, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned, Britons became more family centred.<ref>[[David Kynaston]], ''Family Britain, 1951\u20131957'' (2009)</ref> Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war. [[Holiday camp]]s, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s \u2013 and people increasingly had the money to pursue their personal hobbies. The [[BBC]]'s early television service was given a major boost in 1952 with the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950, just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.<ref>Peter Gurney, \"The Battle of the Consumer in Postwar Britain,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (2005) 77#4 pp. 956\u2013987 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/499831 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nSmall neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by [[chain store]]s and [[shopping centre]]s, with their wide variety of goods, smart advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and [[ribbon development]]s springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the [[green belt]] to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.<ref>Willem van Vliet, ''Housing Markets & Policies under Fiscal Austerity'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, ed. ''A companion to contemporary Britain, 1939\u20132000''</ref> Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. In terms of consumption, there was more equality, especially as the landed gentry was hard pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. As a result of wage rises, consumer spending also increased by about 20% during the same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, the last food rations were ended in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthew Hollow|title='The Age of Affluence': Council Estates and Consumer Society|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=16|issue=1|pages=279\u2013296|url=https://www.academia.edu/1763989|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nEntitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.<ref>C.P. Hill, ''British Economic and Social History 1700\u20131964''</ref> For the young and unattached there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]'' magazine declared that \"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\" Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] claimed that \"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\"  As summed up by [[R. J. Unstead]],\n:\"Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and\\ the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\"<ref>R.J. Unstead, ''A Century of Change: 1837\u2013Today'' (1963) p 224</ref>\n\nAs noted by historian Martin Pugh:\n:\"Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of \u00a38 a week in 1951 to \u00a315 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\"<ref>Martin Pugh, ''Speak for Britain!

Ownership jumped from 18 percent in 1955 to 29 percent in 1958, and 60 percent in 1966.<ref>Dominic Sandbrook, ''Never had it so good: a history of Britain from Suez to the Beatles'' (2005) p 112.</ref> By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.<ref>John Burnett, ''A Social History of Housing 1815\u20131985'' (1990) p 302</ref>\n\n===Relative Decline===\nFrom a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population.<ref>Brian Lapping, ''The Labour Government 1964\u201370''</ref> Education provision expanded, but not as fast as in neighbouring European countries. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with only 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan continued in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.<ref>David McDowall, ''Britain in Close-Up''</ref> In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.<ref>Anthony Sampson, ''The Essential Anatomy of Britain: Democracy in Crisis'' (1993) p 64</ref>\n\nIndustrial growth in Britain, while remaining steady through the 1950s, was not nearly as strong as on the continent. The statistics can be deceptive,  because Britain was far ahead of other European nations in terms of industrial development and urbanization. Countries like Italy, France and Spain, overwhelmingly agrarian in character at the end of the Second World War, were experiencing a process of rapid industrialization and urbanization Britain had already passed through in the 19th century. This approach is known as the \"early start theory\" among economists, and explains why European nations showed markedly stronger levels of absolute growth in industry compared to the UK, a country which was already transitioning into a post-industrial, service-based economy.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\">Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951 \u2013 1970'' (2009) p 305</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref> These countries had large surplus agricultural populations to draw into the cities to work in factories, while the UK as the most heavily urbanized nation in Europe had only a paltry 5% of the population employed on the land by 1945 (dropping to 2.7% by 1977). As such, the traditional source of new labour for low-wage factory work, rural farmers, was virtually non-existent in Britain and accordingly limited growth potential.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a systemic malaise in British industry, which was famously inefficient and opposed to innovations. [[Tony Judt]] described the prevailing attitude of post-war industrialists: \"British factory managers preferred to operate in a cycle of under-investment, limited research and development, low wages and a shrinking pool of clients, rather than risk a fresh start with new products in new markets.\"<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=358}}</ref> The overriding emphasis placed on exports by the British government, in its effort to repair the nation's dollar deficit, made things worse, because it encouraged manufacturers to place all investment in expanding output, at the expense of updating machinery, introducing new technologies, improving production methods, etc. This policy was sustainable in the short-term, because in the late 1940s and early 50s world trade boomed and Britain, with its large and relatively undamaged industrial base, was in a uniquely advantageous position to satisfy demand. In 1950, 25% percent of world exports were British-made, and the total volume of British manufactured goods was double that of France and Germany combined.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=354\u2013357}}</ref> However, by the late 1950s, the economies of West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, had recovered from wartime infrastructure damage, replacing destroyed stock with state-of-the-art machinery and applying modern production methods in a process called \"rejuvenation by defeat\".<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> Continental governments actively encouraged recovery through direct investment/subsidies in targeted industries, in the case of Italy and France, or more widely through encouraging easy access to credit through national banks, a marked characteristic in France and West Germany. British industrialists saw no such intervention from their own government, which more or less left the private sector to itself.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=357}}</ref> British goods were also more expensive abroad because of Sterling's overvaluation, but inferior in quality compared to the products flooding the world market from the United States, Germany and Italy.\n\nRapid decolonization in the British Empire through the late 1950s and 1960s dealt a further blow to British industry. Britain had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the consumer markets within the Empire, enforced by the closed Pound Sterling Bloc, but it could not compete once the territories gained independence and were free to negotiate their own trade agreements.\n\n====Suez Crisis====\nAlthough the '50s were overall a time of great prosperity for Britain, the [[Suez Crisis]] of November 1956 precipitated a financial crisis and a run on Sterling which underlined the fragility of post-war British finances.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book| title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire| author=Lawrence James| year=1994|p=585}}</ref> The tripartite invasion of the [[Suez Canal Zone]] by Britain, France and Israel following Egypt's [[nationalisation]] of the [[Suez Canal Company]] (hitherto, a French company, albeit one with a majority share holding owned by the British government) was a disaster for British prestige and the economy. The United States and the United Nations came out firmly against the occupation, which caused a run on Sterling as foreign governments withdrew their holdings and converted them into either the US Dollar or gold. In the run up to the invasion \u00a3214 million was withdrawn by nervous investors and foreign governments. Britain's decision to freeze Egypt's holdings in response to the nationalization inspired panic in other foreign governments who feared their assets might be frozen if they supported the Egyptian cause. With the invasion a further \u00a3279 million was withdrawn, leaving a scarce \u00a31.965 billion left in Sterling reserves.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Within days Prime Minister Eden was appealing to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] for a $560 million loan, which was only granted on the condition that the country vacate the Canal Zone. This was agreed to, and Britain received a combined $1.3 billion in loans through the IMF and the American [[Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=297}}</ref> British withdrawal from the Canal Zone was completed by 22 December, and the Pound returned to its pre-crisis parity with the Dollar by January 1957, but not without very nearly losing its value as an international reserve currency.\n\n===1960\u20131979: the Sixties and Seventies===\n{{See also|Three-Day Week|Winter of Discontent}}\n\n====Deindustrialization====\nDeindustrialization meant the closure of many operations in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = High | first = Steven | title = \"The wounds of class\": a historiographical reflection on the study of deindustrialization, 1973\u20132013 | journal = [[History Compass]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = 994\u20131007 | doi = 10.1111/hic3.12099 | date = November 2013 | ref = harv }}</ref> A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with older businesses shutting down and new ones opening up.

The Conservative Government presided over a \u2018stop-go\u2019 economy as it tried to prevent inflation spiralling out of control without snuffing out economic growth. Growth continued to be disappointing, at about only half the rate Germany or France achieved in the same period. \n\nIn comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), there was a common perception of continued relative economic decline; Britain slipped from seventh place in the world ranks of income per capita in 1950, to 12th in 1965, and to 20th in 1975. Labour politician [[Richard Crossman]], after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a:\n:sense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> \nEconomists provided four overlapping explanations. The \"early start\" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well relatively because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, structural change achieved in the UK in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the \"rejuvenation by defeat,\" whereby Germans and Japanese managers and politicians had been forced to reequip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of \"Imperial distractions\", whereby Britain's responsibilities to its extensive, though rapidly declining empire handicapped the domestic economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of \"institutional failure\" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed public schools, and universities perpetuating an elitist anti-industrial attitude while trade unions were regarded as traditionalist and conservative. .<ref>Harrison, ''Seeking a Role '' pp 305-6</ref>. An additional factor, perhaps a feature of the social traditionalism, was the alleged disappointing performance of British management.\n\n====Labour responds====\nThe result was a major political crisis, and a [[Winter of Discontent]] in the winter of 1978\u20131979 in during which there were widespread strikes by public sector unions that seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.<ref>Alwyn W.  Turner, ''Crisis?  What Crisis?  Britain in the 1970s'' (2008)</ref><ref>Andy Beckett, ''When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZODPF6/ excerpt and text search].</ref>\n\nHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarized the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\n:If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's  term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular ''modus vivendi'' with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that [[Mrs. Thatcher]] resoundingly defeated it in 1979.<ref>Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (4th ed. 1993)  p 324.</ref>\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]] from 1964 to 1970 was unable to provide a solution either, and eventually was forced to devalue the pound again in 1967. Economist [[Nicholas Crafts]] attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor [[industrial relations]] and insufficient [[vocational training]]. He writes that this was a period of [[government failure]] caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism and a failure to confront interest groups.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/>\n\nBoth political parties had come to the conclusion that Britain needed to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in order to revive its economy. This decision came after establishing a [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) with other, non EEC countries since this provided little economic stimulus to Britain's economy. Levels of trade with the Commonwealth halved in the period 1945\u20131965 to around 25% while trade with the EEC had doubled during the same period. [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed a British attempt at membership in 1963 and again in 1967.\n\nThe [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election in June 1970]] saw the Conservatives, now led by [[Edward Heath]], achieve a surprise return to government after the opinion polls had suggested a third successive Labour victory. Unemployment was still low by this stage, standing at 3% nationally.  It was Heath who took the country into the EEC, in 1973.[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/heath.htm]\n\nHowever, with the continuing relative decline of Britain's economy during the 1960s, management-labour relations deteriorated towards the end of the Wilson government and this worker discontent led to a dramatic breakdown of the industrial environment under the Conservative Government of Edward Heath (1970\u20131974). In the early 1970s, the British economy suffered even more as strike action by trade unions, especially successful action by the miners' union,  plus the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]], led to a [[Three-Day Week|three-day week]] in 1973-74. However, despite a brief period of calm negotiated by the recently re-elected Labour Government of 1974 known as the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]], a breakdown with the unions occurred again in 1978, leading to the [[Winter of Discontent]], and eventually leading to the end of the Labour Government, then being led by [[James Callaghan]], who had succeeded Wilson in 1976.\n\nUnemployment had also risen during this difficult period for the British economy; unemployment reached 1.5 million in 1978 - nearly triple the figure of a decade earlier, with the national rate exceeding 5% for the first time in the postwar era. It had not fallen below 1 million since 1975, and has remained above this level ever since, rarely dropping below 1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 | work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the 1970s, oil was found in the [[North Sea]], off the coast of Scotland, although its contribution to the UK economy was minimised by the need to pay for rising national debt and for welfare payments to the growing number of unemployed people.\n\n===1979\u20131990: the Thatcher era===\n{{see also|Thatcherism}}\nThe election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979 marked the end of the [[post-war consensus]] and a new approach to economic policy, including [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]],\nreform of industrial relations, and tax changes. [[Competition policy]] was emphasised instead of [[industrial policy]]; consequent [[deindustrialisation]] and [[structural unemployment]] was more or less accepted.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/> Thatcher's battles with the unions culminated in the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|Miners' Strike]] of 1984.\n\nThe Government applied [[monetarist]] policies to reduce inflation, and reduced public spending. Deflationary measures were implemented against the backdrop of the [[early 1980s recession|recession of 1980/81]]. Inflation was at its worst at over 20% in 1980, but by 1982-83 it had subsided to less than 10% and continued to subside until stabilizing at around 4% in the autumn of 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain |first=Kenneth O. |last=Morgan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |p=581}}</ref> With the recession of 1980/81, unemployment passed 2 million in the autumn of 1980, 2.5 million the following spring. By January 1982, unemployment had reached 3 million for the first time since the early 1930s, though this time the figure accounted for a lesser percentage of the workforce than the early 1930s figures, now standing at around 12.5% rather than in excess of 20%. In areas hit particularly hard by the loss of industry, unemployment was much higher; coming close to 20% in [[Northern Ireland]] and exceeding 15% in many parts of [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and northern England.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/26/newsid_2506000/2506335.stm | work=BBC News | title=1982: UK unemployment tops three million | date=26 January 1982}}</ref> The peak of unemployment actually came some two years after the recession ended and growth had been re-established, when in April 1984 unemployment stood at just under 3.3 million.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fullfact.org/factchecks/labour_attacks_the_tories_in_scotland-1444 |title=Labour attacks the Tories in Scotland |website=[[Full Fact]] |access-date=18 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816212654/http://fullfact.org/factchecks/labour_attacks_the_tories_in_scotland-1444 |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Canary Wharf at night, from Shadwell cropped.jpg|thumb|The development of a new financial centre at Canary Wharf was initiated by the Thatcher government to revitalize London's disused docklands area]]\nAccording to [[Eric Hobsbawm]], Thatcher oversaw an \"industrial holocaust\", which saw Britain's industrial capacity decrease by fully one quarter during the years 1980\u201384.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Age of Extremes|last = Hobsbawm|first = Eric|publisher = Abacus|year = 1994|isbn = |location = London|pages = 304}}</ref> Major state-controlled firms were privatised, including [[British Aerospace]] (1981), [[British Telecom]] (1984), [[British Leyland]] (1984), [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (1987), and [[British Steel Corporation]] (1988).

The ostensible benefit of this was to give the spur of competition to the British economy, and increase its ultimate efficiency.\n\nThe [[Financial Services Act 1986]] led to a [[deregulation]] later dubbed as ''[[Big Bang (financial markets)|Big Bang]]''.\n\nThe early 1980s recession saw unemployment rise above three million, but the subsequent recovery, which saw annual growth of over 4 percent in the late 1980s, led to contemporary claims of a British 'economic miracle'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kern|first=David|title=UK Economic Decline: 'Myth' or Reality?|url=http://www.rozenbergps.com/books/britain/kern.pdf}}</ref> There is significant controversy as to whether Thatcherism was the reason for the boom in Britain in the 1980s; North Sea oil has been identified as a contributing factor in the increases in economic growth in the mid and late 1980s. However, many of the economic policies put in place by the Thatcher governments have been kept since, and even the Labour Party which had once been so opposed to the policies had by the late 1990s, on its return to government after nearly 20 years in opposition, dropped all opposition to them.\n\nIndeed, the Labour Party of the 1980s had taken a shift to the left after the election of [[Michael Foot]] as leader in 1980, leading to a split in the party to form the centrist [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and contested two general elections, with disappointing results, before merging in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The Conservatives were re-elected in 1983 and again in 1987, with a majority of more than 100 seats both times.\n\nBy the end of 1986, Britain was in the first stages of an economic boom, which saw unemployment fall below 3 million and reach a 10-year low of 1.6 million by December 1989. However, the rate of economic growth slowed down in 1989, with inflation approaching 10% and fears of an imminent recession being rife in the national media. Interest rates were increased by the government in an attempt to control inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2008/10/unemployment-in-uk.html|title=Economics Essays: Unemployment in the UK|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131997: the Major years===\nIn November 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down from the office of Prime Minister after losing first the confidence and then the support in Parliament of the Conservative Party's MPs, which she needed in order to continue. [[John Major]] was elected her successor. The government's popularity was also falling following the introduction of poll tax earlier that year, while unemployment was also starting to increase again as another recession loomed. Opinion polls were suggesting that the next general election could be won by Labour, led by [[Neil Kinnock]] since the resignation of Michael Foot in 1983.\n\nDespite several major economies showing quarterly detraction during 1989, the British economy continued to grow well into 1990, with the first quarterly detraction taking place in the third quarter of the year, by which time unemployment was starting to creep upwards again after four years of falling. The beginning of another recession was confirmed in January 1991. Interest rates had been increased between 1988 and 1990 to control inflation, which topped 10% in 1990 but was below 3% by the end of 1992.\n\nEconomic growth was not re-established until early 1993, but the Conservative government which had been in power continuously since 1979 managed to achieve re-election in April 1992, fending off a strong challenge from Neil Kinnock and Labour, although with a significantly reduced majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s recession was officially the longest in Britain since the Great Depression some 60 years earlier, though the fall in output was not as sharp as that of the downturn of the Great Depression or even that of the early 1980s recession. It had started during 1990 and the end of the recession was not officially declared until April 1993, by which time nearly 3 million people were unemployed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm | work=BBC News | title=1993: Recession over - it's official | date=26 April 1993}}</ref>\n\nThe British pound was tied to EU exchange rates, using the [[Deutsche Mark]] as a basis, as part of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM); however, this resulted in disaster for Britain. The restrictions imposed by the ERM put pressure on the pound, leading to a run on the currency. [[Black Wednesday]] in September 1992 ended British membership of the ERM. It also damaged the credibility of the Conservative's reputation for economic competence, and contributed to the end of the 18 years of consecutive Conservative government in 1997. The party had long been divided over European issues and many of these rifts within the party had still not been mended by 1997.\n\nDespite the downfall of the Conservative government, it had seen a strong economic recovery in which unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since the end of 1992 to 1.7 million by the time of their election defeat just over four years later. Inflation also remained low, with the ERM exit in 1992 being followed by a gradual decrease in interest rates during the years that followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2007/03/economic-record-of-gordon-brown.html|title=Economics Essays: Economic Record of Gordon Brown.|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132001: New Labour===\n{{see also|Blairism}}\nFrom May 1997, [[Tony Blair]]'s newly elected Labour government stuck with the Conservatives' spending plans. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], gained a reputation by some as the \"prudent Chancellor\" and helped to inspire renewed confidence in Labour's ability to manage the economy following the economic failures of earlier Labour governments. One of the first acts that the new Labour government embarked on was to give the power to set interest rates to the [[Bank of England]], effectively ending the use of interest rates as a political tool. Control of the banks was given to the Financial Services Agency.  Labour also introduced the [[minimum wage]] to the [[United Kingdom]], which has been raised every year since its introduction in April 1999. The Blair government also introduced a number of strategies to cut unemployment, including an expansion of the public sector. Unemployment was constantly below 1.5 million during the first half of the 2000s - a level not seen since the late 1970s, although the government never succeeded in getting unemployment back into the six figure tallies which were seen for most of the 30 years after the end of World War II.\n\n==21st century==\n{{Further|Economy of the United Kingdom}}\nIn the Labour Party's second term in office, beginning in 2001, when it achieved another landslide victory, the party increased taxes and borrowing. The government wanted the money to increase spending on public services, notably the [[National Health Service]], which they claimed was suffering from chronic under-funding. The economy shifted from manufacturing, which had been declining since the 1960s and grew on the back of the services and finance sectors, while the public sector continued to expand. The country was also at war with first [[Afghanistan]], invading in 2001 and then [[Iraq]], in 2003 - which proved controversial with the British public. Spending on both reached several billion pounds a year and the government's popularity began to slide, although it did manage to win a third general election under Blair in 2005 with a reduced majority. Blair stepped down two years later after a decade as prime minister to be succeeded by the former Chancellor Gordon Brown, the change of leader coming at a time when Labour was starting to lag behind the Conservatives (led by [[David Cameron]]) in the opinion polls.\n\nBy this stage, unemployment had increased slightly to 1.6 million although the economy continued to grow, the UK was continuing to lose large numbers of manufacturing jobs due to companies encountering financial problems or switching production overseas to save labour costs. This was particularly evident in the car industry, with [[General Motors]] ([[Vauxhall]]) and Ford having significantly cut back on UK operations, while [[Peugeot]] (the French carmaker who had bought the former [[Rootes Group]] and [[Chrysler Europe]] operations in the late 1970s) had completely withdrawn from Britain. These closures resulted in thousands of job losses, although the biggest single blow to the car industry came in 2005 when [[MG Rover]] went into liquidation; more than 6,000 jobs were lost at the carmaker alone and some 20,000 more were lost in associated supply industries and dealerships, not to mention the business failures and job cuts which befell businesses that had relied largely on trade from the carmaker's employees. This was the largest collapse of any European carmaker in modern times.\n\nGrowth rates were consistently between 1.6% and 3% from 2000 to early 2008. Inflation though relativity steady at around 2%, did rise in the approach to the financial crash. The Bank of England's control of interest rates was a major factor in the stability of the British economy over that period{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. The [[Pound Sterling|pound]] continued to fluctuate, however, reaching a low against the dollar in 2001 (to a rate of $1.37 per \u00a31), but rising again to a rate of approximately $2 per \u00a31 in 2007. Against the Euro, the pound was steady at a rate of approximately \u20ac1.45 per \u00a31. Since then, the effects of the [[Credit crunch]] have led to a slowdown of the economy. At the start of November 2008, for example, the pound was worth around \u20ac1.26; by the end of the year, it had almost approached parity, dropping at one point below \u20ac1.02 and ending the year at \u20ac1.04.\n\n===The 2008 recession and quantitative easing===\n{{Update section|date=June 2014}}\nThe UK entered a recession in Q2 of 2008, according to the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and exited it in Q4 of 2009.

Figures in fact showed no growth in retail sales in September 2009, and a 2.5% decline in industrial output in August.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The revised UK figures confirmed that the economy shrank in Q3 of 2009 by 0.2%, although government spending on cash for the car scrappage scheme helped. The car scrappage scheme enabled owners of cars at least 10 years old to buy a new car at a reduced price in return for having their old car scrapped, and proved very popular with motorists.\n\nYet this temporary lapse was followed by a solid 0.4% growth in the Q4.\n\nUK manufacturers' body, the EEF, appealed for more cash from the government: \"Without an extension of support for business investment in the pre-Budget statement next month, it will be difficult to see where the momentum for growth will come from.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8378129.stm | work=BBC News | title=Economy shrinks less than thought | date=25 November 2009 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe downturn in the economy during 2008 and 2009 saw the popularity of the Labour government slump, and opinion polls all showed the Conservatives in the lead during this time, although by early 2010 the gap between the parties was narrow enough to suggest that the imminent general election would result in a [[hung parliament]] - as happened in May 2010. The Conservatives had the largest number of seats in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|election]], 20 short of a majority, and formed a government in coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The new government was faced with having to make deep public spending cuts over the following years in order to tackle the high level of national debt which had mounted up during Labour's response to the recession, which meant that unemployment remained high and the economy struggled to re-establish growth, although a marked improvement finally occurred in 2013 when economic growth and falling unemployment were sustained.\n\n[[Moody's]] maintained the UK's AAA credit rating in September 2010, forecasting stable finances largely driven by governmental action. It also reported that while the economy is flexible to grow in the future household debt repayments, a poor export market and the economy's large exposure to the finance sector were factors likely to sap growth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11373977 | work=BBC News | title=Moody's hails UK austerity effort | date=20 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent to that, the economy contracted in 5 of the next 7 quarters, thus ensuring zero net growth from the end of the recession at the end of 2009, through to the middle of 2012.

The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]\u2019s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman's work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington's and glass manufacture.<ref>John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S \u2018Fifty years of Business History\u2019, ''Business History'' (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26</ref><ref>. Leslie Hannah, \u2018New Issues in British Business History\u2019, ''Business History Review'' (1983) 57# 2, pp.165-174.</ref>  These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler's synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.<ref>Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).</ref><ref>William Mass, & William Lazonick, \"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\" ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.</ref>\n\nStudies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.<ref>Howard L.

Other research centres followed, notably at Glasgow and Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]](Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.<ref>Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\" ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics|Money}}\n* [[Economy of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Poor Laws]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[European Single Market]]\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[History of England]]\n** [[History of Northern Ireland]]\n** [[History of Scotland]]\n** [[History of Wales]]\n* [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[Economic history of Scotland]]\n* [[History of trade unions in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[English society]]\n* [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)]], includes some economic topics\n* [[History of company law in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of recessions in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Aldcroft |first=D.

These developments resulted in Britain becoming the premier economies in Europe during the first half of the 19th century, the most prominent industrial power in the world economy and a major political entity. Its industrialists were major innovators in machinery such as steam engines (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, and tool-making. Britons pioneered the [[railway]] system and built many systems and sold most of the equipment other nations used.  Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. The markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the expanding [[British Empire]]. After 1840, an economic policy of [[mercantilism]] was abandoned and replaced by \"free trade,\" with few tariffs, quotas or restrictions. The powerful [[Royal Navy]] protected British interests, shipping and international trade, while the British legal system provided a system for resolving disputes relatively inexpensively, and the [[City of London]] functioned as the economic capital and focus of the world economy.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1900, [[Income per capita|economic output per head]] of the British population rose by 50 percent (from about \u00a328 per capita to \u00a341 in 1900: an annual average increase in real incomes of 1% p.a.), growth which was associated with a significant rise in [[living standards]].<ref>Charles H.

In 1870, Britain's output per head was the second highest in the world, surpassed only by [[Economic history of Australia|Australia]]. In 1914, British income per capita was the world's third highest, exceeded only by [[Economic History of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia; these three countries shared a common economic, social and cultural heritage. In 1950, British output per head was still 30 percent above of the six founder members of the [[EEC]], but within 20 years it had been overtaken by the majority of western European economies. <ref>Lee, Clive. ''The British economy since 1700: a macroeconomic perspective'' (1986)</ref> \n\nThe response of successive British governments to this problematic performance was to seek economic growth stimuli within what became the [[European Union]]; Britain entered the [[European Community]] in 1973. Thereafter the United Kingdom's relative economic performance improved substantially to the extent that, on the eve of the 2007 crisis, British income  per capita exceeded, albeit marginally, that of [[Economic history of France|France]] and Germany; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the gap in income per capita terms between the UK and USA. This period also saw high rates of economic growth in the [[Pacific Basin]] with, first, [[economic history of Japan|Japan]] and then [[Economic history of South Korea|South Korea]] emerging as major economies as globalisation produced widespread economic development in the [[world economy]]. <ref name=\"Crafts\">{{cite book|last=Crafts|first=Nicholas|title=Britain's Relative Economic Performance, 1870\u20131999|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|location=London|isbn=978-0-255-36524-6|year=1966}}</ref>\n\n==16th\u201317th centuries==\n[[File:Arms of Owen Tudor.svg|thumb|150px|Ancient coat of arms of the Tudor family.]]\nDuring 16th and 17th century many fundamental economic changes occurred, these resulted in rising incomes and paved the way to the industrialisation. After 1600, the North Sea region took over the role of the leading economic centre of Europe from the Mediterranean, which prior to this date, particularly in [[northern Italy]], had been the most highly developed part of Europe. Great Britain, together with the [[Low Countries]], profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade, Spain and Portugal, fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The export of woollen products resulted in an economic upturn with products exported to mainland Europe. [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] negotiated the favourable [[Intercursus Magnus]] treaty in 1496.<ref>David M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547-1603'' p. 300.</ref>\n\nThe high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were temporary. When the population recovered, low wages and a land shortage returned.  Historians in the early 20th century characterized the economic in terms of general decline, manorial reorganization, and agricultural contraction. Later historians dropped those themes and stressed the transitions between medieval forms and Tudor progress.<ref>Michael Postan, \"Revisions in Economic History.

He found other towns in decline, and suggested that investment by entrepreneurs and benefactors had enabled some small towns to prosper.<ref>John S.

The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.<ref>[[Derek Hirst]], \"Locating the 1650s in England's seventeenth century\" ''History'' (1996) 81#263 pp 359-83 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24423269 online]</ref>\n\n===Growth in money supply===\nSpanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World exported large quantities of silver and gold to Europe, some of which added to the English money supply. There were multiple results that all helped expand and grow the English economy, according to Dr. Nuno Palma of the University of Manchester.  The key features of the growth pattern included specialization and structural change, and increases in market participation. The new supply of specie (silver and gold) increased the money supply. Instead of  promissory notes paid off by future promissory notes, business transactions were supported by hard specie. This reduced transaction costs, increased the coverage of the market, and opened incentives and opportunities  to participate in cash transaction. Demand arose for luxury goods from Asia, such as silk and pepper, which created new upscale market demands. The increased supply of specie made tax collection easier, allowing the government to build up fiscal capacity and provide for public goods.<ref>N. Palma, \"Money and modernization in early modern England\" ''Financial History Review'' (2019), [http://www.ehes.org/EHES_147.pdf preprint EHES Working Paper No. 147, February 2019, online]</ref>\n\nVarious inflationary pressures existed; some were due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population. Inflation had a negative effect on the real wealth of most families.<ref>J. R. Wordie, \"Deflationary factors in the Tudor price rise.\" ''Past & Present'' 154 (1997): 32-70.</ref> It set the stage for social upheaval with the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with [[manorial]] lords beginning the process of [[enclosure]].<ref>Ian Dawson, ''The Tudor century'' (1993) p. 214</ref>\n\n===Exports===\n\nEspecially within the British empire, exports started to increase heavily in this period. Mostly privately-owned companies traded with the colonies in the West Indies, Northern America and India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=15\u201316|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London]] brought together [[City of London|London]]'s leading overseas merchants in a regulated company in the early 15th century, in the nature of a [[guild]].  Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) woollen [[broadcloth]].  This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.<ref>Robert Brenner, ''Merchants and revolution: commercial change, political conflict, and London's overseas traders, 1550-1653'' (Verso, 2003).</ref><ref>E.  Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1956), 2:196-268.</ref>\n\n===Wool industry===\n{{Further|Medieval English wool trade}}\nWoollen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture. The golden era of the Wiltshire woollen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as Merchant Adventurers, exported woollens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of Huguenots from France brought in new skills that expanded the industry.<ref>G.D. Ramsay, ''The English woollen industry, 1500-1750'' (1982).</ref><ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England: vol 2: The age of mercantilism'' (7th 1964) pp 10-92.</ref><ref>Peter J. Bowden, ''Wool Trade in Tudor and Stuart England'' (1962) [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-349-81676-7#toc online].</ref>\n\nGovernment intervention proved a disaster in the early 17th century. A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]]. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England.  Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back.  However, the trade losses became permanent.<ref>C.G.A. Clay, ''Economic Expansion and Social Change: England 1500-1700: Volume 2, Industry, Trade and Government'' (1984)  pp 119-20.</ref>\n\n===Diets===\nThe diet depended largely on social class. The rich ate meat\u2014beef, pork, venison\u2014and white bread, the poor ate coarse dark bread, with a little meat perhaps at Christmas. Everyone drank ale\u2014water was often too impure to drink. Fruits and vegetables were seldom eaten. Rich spices were used by the wealthy to offset the smells of old salted meat. Vegetables and fruits were not popular. The potato was not part of the diet. The rich enjoyed desserts such as pastries, tarts, cakes, and crystallized fruit, and syrup.<ref>Stephen Mennell, ''All manners of food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present'' (University of Illinois Press, 1996).</ref>\n\nAmong the rich private hospitality was an important item in the budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman.  Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known.\n\nBoth the rich and the poor had diets with nutritional deficiency. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in [[scurvy]].\n\nTrade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread distress.<ref>Andrew B. Appleby, ''Famine in Tudor and Stuart England'' (Stanford University Press, 1978).</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did do in France.<ref>Andrew B.

By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:  \n:we are the most \"diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.\"<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) p 344</ref>\n\nWhile the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and Prussia's [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports soared from \u00a36.5 million in 1700, to \u00a314.7 million in 1760 and \u00a343.2 million in 1800.<ref>E. Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) p 188.</ref>  Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.<ref>Eric J.

Lipson, ''The Economic History of England'' (1931) pp 184-370 gives capsule histories of 10 major trading companies: The Merchant Adventurers, the East India Company, the Eastland Company, the Russia Company, the Levant Company, the African Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, the French Company, the Spanish Company, and the South Sea Company.</ref> However, there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331 million through [[market manipulation]] and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king.  His chief minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.<ref>Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) pp 334\u201338</ref><ref>Julian Hoppit, \"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble,\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141\u2013165</ref>\n\n=== The Age of Mercantilism ===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\nThe basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of [[mercantilism]], an economic theory that stressed maximizing the trade outside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The 18th century British Empire was based upon the preceding [[English overseas possessions]], which began to take shape in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the English settlement of islands of the [[West Indies]] such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Bahamas]], the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Bermuda]], and of Virginia, one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which in 1776 became the United States, as well as of the [[Maritime provinces]] of what is now Canada.  The sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised England's most lucrative colonies. The American colonies also used slave labour in the farming of tobacco, indigo, and rice in the south. England, and later Great Britain's, American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonization. Victory over the French during the [[Seven Years' War]] gave Great Britain control over what is now eastern Canada.\n\nMercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max Savelle|title=Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204|year=1948|page=204ff|isbn=9781419107078}}</ref>   Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants&mdash;and kept others out&mdash;by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The [[Navigation Acts]] of the late 17th century provided the legal foundation for Mercantilist policy. They required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the [[Acts of Union 1707]] united Scotland with England).<ref>Darwin, 2012 p.21-22</ref> Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion-earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on Britain for their finished goods.<ref>Darwin, 2012 p. 166</ref>\n\nThe government had to fight smuggling&mdash;which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Otto Trevelyan|title=The American Revolution vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sfwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|year=1899|page=128ff}}</ref>  The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R.

Blast furnaces light the iron making town of [[Coalbrookdale]].]]\n\nIn 1709, [[Abraham Darby I]] established a [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.<ref>H. R. Schubert, ''History of the British Iron and Steel Industry ... to 1775 AD'' (Routledge, 1957)</ref>\n\n=== The Industrial Revolution ===\n{{main|Industrial Revolution}}\n\nIn a period loosely dated from the 1770s to the 1820s, Britain experienced an accelerated process of economic change that transformed a largely agrarian economy into the world's first industrial economy. This phenomenon is known as the \"[[industrial revolution]]\", since the changes were far-reaching and permanent throughout many areas of Britain, especially in the developing cities.<ref>E. Anthony Wrigley, \"Reconsidering the Industrial Revolution: England and Wales.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 49.01 (2018): 9-42.</ref>\n\nEconomic, institutional, and social changes were fundamental to the emergence of the industrial revolution. Whereas absolutism remained the normal form of governance through most parts of Europe, in the UK a fundamental power balance was created after the revolutions of 1640 and 1688. The new institutional setup ensured property rights and political safety and thereby supported the emergence of an economically prosperous middle class. Another factor is the change in marriage patterns through this period. Marrying later allowed young people to acquire more education, thereby building up more human capital in the population. These changes enhanced the already relatively developed labour and financial markets, paving the way for the industrial revolution starting in the mid-18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of [[iron-making]] techniques and the increased use of [[coke (fuel)|refined coal]]. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, [[turnpike trusts|improved roads]] and [[Rail transport|railways]]. Factories pulled thousands from low productivity work in agriculture to high productivity urban jobs.<ref>Redford, Arthur (1976), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DBQNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PR5&dq=population+movement+industrial+revolution&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KIP-Tue3BIKV8gPR6LzQBQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Labour migration in England, 1800-1850\"], p. 6. Manchester University Press, Manchester.</ref>\n\nThe introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of [[water wheel]]s and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as [[industrialisation]].\n\nAccording to [[Max Weber]], the foundations of this process of change can be traced back to the Puritan Ethic of the Puritans of the 17th century.<ref>Hartmut Lehmann and Guenther Roth, eds. ''Weber's Protestant Ethic: Origins, Evidence, Contexts'' (1995)</ref>  This produced modern personalities attuned to innovation and committed to a work ethic, inspiring landed and merchant elites alive to the benefits of modernization, and a system of agriculture able to produce increasingly cheap food supplies. To this must be added the influence of religious nonconformity, which increased literacy and inculcated a \"[[Protestant work ethic]]\" amongst skilled artisans.<ref>Margaret C. Jacob, and Matthew Kadane, \"Missing, Now Found in the Eighteenth Century: Weber's Protestant Capitalist,\" ''American Historical Review,'' (Feb 2003) 108#1 pp 20-49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/533044 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nA long run of good harvests, starting in the first half of the 18th century, resulted in an increase in disposable income and a consequent rising demand for manufactured goods, particularly textiles. The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] enabled wider cloth to be woven faster, but also created a demand for yarn that could not be fulfilled. Thus, the major technological advances associated with the industrial revolution were concerned with spinning. [[James Hargreaves]] created the [[Spinning Jenny]], a device that could perform the work of a number of spinning wheels. However, while this invention could be operated by hand, the [[water frame]], invented by [[Richard Arkwright]], could be powered by a [[water wheel]]. Indeed, Arkwright is credited with the widespread introduction of the [[factory system]] in Britain, and is the first example of the successful mill owner and industrialist in British history. The water frame was, however, soon supplanted by the [[spinning mule]] (a cross between a water frame and a jenny) invented by [[Samuel Crompton]]. Mules were later constructed in iron by Messrs. Horrocks of Stockport.\n\nAs they were water powered, the first mills were constructed in rural locations by streams or rivers. Workers villages were created around them, such as [[New Lanark]] Mills in Scotland. These spinning mills resulted in the decline of the [[domestic system]], in which spinning with old slow equipment was undertaken in rural cottages.\n\nThe [[steam engine]] was invented and became a power supply that soon surpassed waterfalls and horsepower. The first practicable steam engine was invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]], and was used for pumping water out of mines. A much more powerful steam engine was invented by [[James Watt]]; it had a [[reciprocating engine]] capable of powering machinery. The first steam-driven textile mills began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, and this transformed the industrial revolution into an urban phenomenon, greatly contributing to the appearance and rapid growth of industrial towns.\n\nThe progress of the textile trade soon outstripped the original supplies of raw materials. By the turn of the 19th century, imported American cotton had replaced wool in the [[North West of England]], though wool remained the chief textile in [[Yorkshire]]. Textiles have been identified as the catalyst in technological change in this period. The application of steam power stimulated the demand for coal; the demand for machinery and rails stimulated the [[iron industry]]; and the demand for transportation to move raw material in and finished products out stimulated the growth of the canal system, and (after 1830) the railway system.\n\nSuch an unprecedented degree of economic growth was not sustained by domestic demand alone. The application of technology and the factory system created such levels of [[mass production]] and cost efficiency that enabled British manufacturers to export inexpensive cloth and other items worldwide.\n\n[[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] has posited the 1790s as the \"take-off\" period for the industrial revolution. This means that a process previously responding to domestic and other external stimuli began to feed upon itself, and became an unstoppable and irreversible process of sustained industrial and technological expansion.\n\nIn the late 18th century and early 19th century a series of technological advances led to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Britain's position as the world's pre-eminent trader helped fund research and experimentation. The nation also had some of the world's greatest reserves of [[coal]], the main fuel of the new revolution.\n\nIt was also fuelled by a rejection of mercantilism in favour of the predominance of [[Adam Smith]]'s [[capitalism]]. The fight against Mercantilism was led by a number of [[liberalism|liberal]] thinkers, such as [[Richard Cobden]], [[Joseph Hume]], [[Francis Place]] and [[John Roebuck]].\n\nSome have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British [[slave trade]] between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. It has been pointed out, however, that slave trade and the [[West Indies|West Indian]] plantations provided less than 5% of the British national income during the years of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |title=Was slavery the engine of economic growth? |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513025327/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/con_economic.cfm |archivedate=13 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Industrial Revolution saw a rapid transformation in the British economy and society. Previously, large industries had to be near forests or rivers for power. The use of coal-fuelled engines allowed them to be placed in large urban centres. These new factories proved far more efficient at producing goods than the [[cottage industry]] of a previous era. These manufactured goods were sold around the world, and raw materials and luxury goods were imported to Britain.\n\n===Empire===\n{{main|British Empire|Historiography of the British Empire}}\nDuring the Industrial Revolution the empire became less important and less well-regarded. The British defeat in the [[American War of Independence]] (1775\u20131783) deprived it of its largest and most developed colonies. This loss brought a realisation that colonies were not particularly economically beneficial to the home economy.<ref>Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997'' (2010)</ref>  It was realised that the costs of occupation of colonies often exceeded the financial return to the taxpayer. In other words, formal empire afforded no great economic benefit when trade would continue whether the overseas political entities were nominally sovereign or not. The American Revolution helped demonstrate this by showing that Britain could still control trade with the colonies without having to pay for their defence and governance. Capitalism encouraged the British to grant their colonies self-government, starting with [[History of Canada|Canada]], which became unified and largely independent in 1867, and [[History of Australia|Australia]], which followed suit in 1901.<ref>Peter Cain and Tony Hopkins. ''British Imperialism: 1688-2000'' (2nd ed. 2001)</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\nCritical to British success in confronting Napoleon was its superior economic situation. It was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France.  With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers \u2013 economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref>\n\nMost important, the British national output remained strong. Textiles and iron grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared\u2014it was a golden age for agriculture even as food shortages appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the food shortages of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate food shortages.<ref>Roger Wells, \"The revolt of the south-west, 1800-1801: a study in English popular protest,\" ''Social History'' (1977) #6 pp 713-744.</ref>  Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 162-4</ref>\n\nThe system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The well-organized business sector channelled products into what the military needed. Not only did British cloth provide for British uniforms, it clothed the allies as well and indeed the French soldiers too. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.<ref>Briggs, ''The Making of Modern England 1783-1867: The Age of Improvement'' (1959) pp 143, 162</ref>\n\n[[File:Dette britannique longue p\u00e9riode.png|thumb|The [[national debt]] of the United Kingdom was at a record high percentage of the GDP as the Napoleonic wars ended, but was largely repaid by 1914.]]\nThe British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366 million, including \u00a310 million for the Navy, \u00a340 million for the Army, \u00a310 million for the Allies, and \u00a338 million as interest on the national debt.

The economy was not damaged by the diversion of manpower to the army and navy; in terms of destruction and enforced transfer of national wealth, Britain came out ahead. British control of the oceans proved optimal in creating a liberal free-trade global economy, and helped Britain gain the lion's share of the world's carrying trade and financial support services. The effects were positive for agriculture and most industries, apart from construction. The rate of capital formation was slowed somewhat and national income perhaps would have grown even faster without war. The most negative impact was a drop in living standards for the urban working classes.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, \"The Impact of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, on the Long-Run Growth of the British Economy,\" ''Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center'' (1989) 12#3 pp 335-395.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n19th century Britain was the world's richest and most advanced economy.

The article helped launch the [[Cambridge School of historiography]]. Gallagher and Robinson used the British experience to construct a framework for understanding European imperialism that swept away the all-or-nothing thinking of previous historians.<ref>R. E. Robinson and John Gallagher, ''Africa and the Victorians: The official mind of imperialism'' (1966).</ref>  They found that European leaders rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" had to be based upon formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal influence in independent areas.  According to Wm.patrick santian at mesita elementary\n historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'\"<ref>Wm. Roger Louis, ''Imperialism'' (1976) p. 4.</ref>  Oron Hale said  that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they, \"found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion.

Like that of the years following 1815, the 1840s recession was caused by a series of bad harvests, this time from a blight affecting potatoes facilitated by unusually wet and cold conditions in Northern Europe. Ireland, where the population was heavily dependent on potatoes for subsistence, was the worst affected. On mainland Britain, regions of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Outer Hebrides]] were worst affected by the potato blight (some parts were depopulated by as much as 50%).<ref>{{cite book| title=The Pursuit of Power: Europe 1815-1914| author=Richard J.

This emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal. Domestic consumption in household heaths remained an important market though coal also fired the new steam engines installed in textile factories.  Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system.  In 1815, [[George Stephenson]] invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways ''system'' in 1825 by opening the [[Stockton and Darlington]] line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building\u2014a veritable bubble, but one with permanent value. [[Thomas Brassey]] brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model.  Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges. The telegraph, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways because it allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through. Telegraphs made it possible to use a single track for two-way traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914. The boom years were 1836 and 1845\u201347, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of \u00a3200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices.\n[[File:George Hudson - Project Gutenberg eText 17293.jpg|200px|thumb|[[George Hudson]]]]\n\n[[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1806\u20131859) designed the first major railway, the [[Great Western Railway|Great Western]], built originally in the 1830s to cover the 100 miles from London to Bristol. Even more important was the highly controversial [[George Hudson]]. He became Britain's \"railway king\" by merging numerous short lines.<ref>A. J. Arnold, and S. McCartney, ''George Hudson: The Rise and Fall of the Railway King'' (2004)</ref>  Since there was no government agency supervising the railways, Hudson set up a system that all the lines adopted called the [[Railway Clearing House]]. It made interconnections easy for people and freight by standardizing routines for transferring freight and people between companies, and loaning out freight cars. By 1849 Hudson controlled nearly 30% of Britain's trackage. Hudson did away with accountants and manipulated funds\u2014paying large dividends out of capital because profits were quite low, but no one knew that until his system collapsed and the railway bubble of the late 1840s burst.<ref>Adrian Vaughan, ''Railwaymen, Politics and Money: The Great Age of Railways in Britain'' (1997) pp 102-12</ref>\n\n[[File:Euston Station showing wrought iron roof of 1837.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Euston railway station|Euston station in London]], 1837. Note the open passenger carriages]]\n\nBy 1850 Britain had a well integrated, well engineered system that provided fast, on-time, inexpensive movement of freight and people to every city and most rural districts. Freight rates had plunged to a penny a ton mile for coal.  The system directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, conductors, mechanics, repairmen, accountants, station agents and managers, bringing a new level of business sophistication that could be applied to many other industries, and helping many small and large businesses to expand their role in the industrial revolution. Thus railways had a tremendous impact on industrialization. By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railway system itself. The system kept growing; by 1880, there were 13,500 locomotives which each carried 97,800 passengers a year, or 31,500 tons of freight.<ref>[[Jack Simmons (historian)|Jack Simmons]] and Gordon Biddle, ''The Oxford Companion to British Railway History: From 1603 to the 1990s'' (1999)</ref>\n\n=== Second Industrial Revolution ===\n{{Main|Second Industrial Revolution}}\n[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|thumb]]\n[[File:graph rel lvl indz 1750 1900 01.png|thumb]]\nDuring the First Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as the dominant figure in the capitalist system. In the later decades of the 19th century, when the ultimate control and direction of large industry came into the hands of financiers, industrial capitalism gave way to [[financial capitalism]] and the corporation. The establishment of behemoth industrial empires, whose assets were controlled and managed by men divorced from production, was a dominant feature of this third phase. By the middle of the 19th century, as the world's only fully industrialized nation, British output represented just under half the total of the world's industrial capacity.<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/>\n\nNew products and services were also introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in [[steam engine]] design and the wide availability of cheap iron (and after 1870 steel) meant that slow, sailing ships could be replaced with [[steamship]]s, such as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] ''[[SS Great Western]]''. Electricity and [[history of chemical engineering|chemical]] industries became important although Britain lagged behind the U.S. and Germany.\n\nAmalgamation of industrial [[cartel]]s into larger corporations, mergers and alliances of separate firms, and technological advancement (particularly the increased use of electric power and [[internal combustion engine]]s fuelled by gasoline) were mixed blessings for British business during the late [[Victorian era]]. The ensuing development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe [[Long Depression]] of 1873-1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low &mdash; and falling &mdash; profit rates and price deflation after 1873.\n\nBy the 1870s, financial houses in London had achieved an unprecedented level of control over industry. This contributed to increasing concerns among policy-makers over the protection of British investments overseas &mdash; particularly those in the securities of foreign governments and in foreign-government-backed development activities, such as railways. Although it had been official British policy to support such investments, with the large expansion of these investments in the 1860s, and the economic and political instability of many areas of investment (such as [[Egypt]]), calls upon the government for methodical protection became increasingly pronounced in the years leading up to the Crystal Palace Speech. At the end of the [[Victorian era]], the [[service sector]] (banking, insurance and shipping, for example) began to gain prominence at the expense of manufacturing. During the late 18th century the United Kingdom experienced stronger increases in the service sector than in the industrial sector; industry grew by only 2 percent, whereas the service sector employment increased by 9 percent.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The 19th century saw Company rule extended across India after expelling the Dutch, French and Portuguese. By the 1830s the Company was a government and had given up most of its business in India, but it was still privately owned.

To protect the canal, Britain expanded further, taking control of Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Cyprus, Palestine, Aden, and British Somaliland.  None were especially profitable until the discovery of oil in the Middle East after 1920.  Some military action was involved, and from time to time there was a risk of conflict with other imperial powers seeking the same territory, as in the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898.  All the incidents were resolved peacefully.\n\nCain and Hopkins argue that the phases of expansion abroad were closely linked with the development of the domestic economy. Therefore, the shifting balance of social and political forces under imperialism and the varying intensity of Britain's economic and political rivalry with other powers need to be understood with reference to domestic policies. Gentlemen capitalists, representing Britain's landed gentry and London's service sectors and financial institutions, largely shaped and controlled Britain's imperial enterprises in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Industrial leaders played a lesser role and found themselves dependent on the gentlemen capitalists.<ref>P. J. Cain and A. G. Hopkins, \"Gentlemanly Capitalism and British Expansion Overseas I.

The bursting of a railroad speculation bubble in the United States, heavily financed via London, was a major factor in the initial shock. British foreign investment fell sharply, but it took some years for record high domestic investments to fall as well. The initial Depression lasted between 1873-1879, and was marked above all by price [[deflation]], and therefore declining profitability for industrialists and financiers. Shrinking returns and a generally unfavorable economic climate meant that investment as a percentage of Britain's [[National wealth]], both overseas and at home, fell from an average of 12.6% between 1870\u201374, to 9.7% between 1875-1896.<ref>Musson, 1959; p. 211</ref> The sluggish world market, which was at its weakest in the 1880s, was keenly felt in the export-reliant economy of the UK.

There were no severe depressions and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate, manufacturing output, and GDP (but not per capita) fell behind its rivals the United States, and Germany. Nevertheless, the nation still led the world in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing and mining.<ref>Jean-Pierre Dormois and Michael Dintenfass, eds., ''The British Industrial Decline'' (1999)</ref> Growth in the mining sector was strong and the coal industry played a significant role as the focus of the world's energy market; this prominence was to be challenged after the First World War by the growth of the oil industry and continuing development of the internal combustion engine. Although the relative contribution of the agricultural sector was becoming less important, productivity in the British agriculture sector was relatively high. \n\nBy international standards, and across all sectors of the United Kingdom, the British services sectors exhibited high labour factor productivity and, especially, total factor productivity; as was to be even more the case one hundred years later, it was the services sectors that provided the British economy's relative advantage in 1900. \n\nIt has been suggested that the industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and that there was a striking preference for leisure over industrial entrepreneurship among the elite. In 1910, the British share of world industrial capacity stood at 15%, just behind Germany's 16%, and less than half of the United States' 35%.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> Despite signs of relative weakness in certain sectors of the UK economy, the major achievements of the Edwardian years should be underlined. The City was the financial centre of the world\u2014far more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. British investment abroad doubled in the Edwardian years, from \u00a32 billion in 1900 to \u00a34 billion in 1913.<ref name=\"John Darwin 2012\"/> Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its informal empire in Latin America and other nations.

Social amenities, especially in urban centres, were accumulating \u2013 prosperity was highly visible. Among the working class there was a growing demand for access to a greater say in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues only became significant about 1908.

Willan'' (Manchester University Press, 1977), pp. 258-78.</ref> In depressed areas the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.<ref>R. J. Finlay, \"National identity in crisis: politicians, intellectuals and the 'end of Scotland', 1920-1939,\" ''History,'' June 1994, vol. 79, (256), pp. 242-59.</ref>\n\n===Productivity & Employment===\nIn 1919, Britain reduced the working hours in major industries to a 48-hour week for industrial workers. Historians have debated whether this move depressed labour productivity and contributed to the slump. Scott and Spadavecchia argue that productivity was in some ways enhanced, especially through higher hourly productivity, and that Britain did not suffer in its exports because most other nations also reduced working hours. Looking at coal, cotton, and iron and steel, they find that Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries.<ref>Peter Scott and Anna Spadavecchia, \"Did the 48-hour week damage Britain's industrial competitiveness?,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 2011) 64#4 pp 1266-1288</ref> By 1924 workers had regained their productive output of 1913, this while working greatly reduced hours compared to the pre-war years.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump| author=Carter & Mears| year=2011| p=155}}</ref> By 1938 British industrial productivity had increased by 75% compared to pre-1914 levels, even after the setbacks of reduced working hours and the effects of the Great Depression were taken into account.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMonetary policy of postwar governments also contributed to high unemployment. By April 1925, years of stringent [[deflation]]ary policies by the British Exchequer had accomplished the intended goal of returning the Pound Sterling to its pre-war exchange rate of $4.86. This high exchange rate made for cheap consumer prices and a high [[Real wages|real wage]] for UK workers. However, interest rates were also high as a result, making the cost of doing business all the more expensive, while high labour costs were inevitably offset by employers with layoffs and reduced hiring.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://eml.berkeley.edu/~eichengr/research/floudjohnsonchaptersep16-03.pdf| title=The British Economy Between the Wars| author=Barry Eichengreen| publisher=eml.berkeley.edu| year=2002| p=20}}</ref>\n\nBy 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. While the economy was recovering by 1922\u20131923, the UK found itself struggling again by 1926, the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|general strike]] of that year doing it no favours. Growth for the remainder of the decade became erratic, with brief periods of stagnation constantly interrupting growth. Industrial relations briefly improved, but then came the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street stock market crash]] in October 1929, which sparked the worldwide [[Great Depression]] (See the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jakesimpkin.org/ArticlesResearch/GreatBritain19001950/tabid/93/Default.aspx|title=Jake Simpkin - Local Historian & Guide > Home|work=jakesimpkin.org|access-date=29 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141229/http://www.jakesimpkin.org/ArticlesResearch/GreatBritain19001950/tabid/93/Default.aspx|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Unemployment had stood at less than 1.8 million at the end of 1930, but by the end of 1931 it had risen sharply to more than 2.6 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/24/stock-market-unemployment-1931 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Research | last=Department | title=1931:The spectre of mass unemployment haunts the UK | date=24 May 2011}}</ref> By January 1933, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed, accounting for more than 20% of the workforce - with unemployment topping 50% in some parts of the country, particularly in [[South Wales]] and the north-east of [[England]].

In 1880, Britain produced 1.3 million tons of steel, and in 1893 3 million tons; by 1914 output was 8 million tons. Germany caught up in 1893 and produced 14 million tons in 1914.<ref>B. R.

The industry made significant technical advances in terms of vanadium, phospho-magnetic steels and other specialized high-strength alloys, using the electric furnace and other innovations, the devising of new techniques over the smoke issue. The industry trained a cadre of experts that made large firms scientifically self-sustaining.<ref>Michael Sanderson, \"The Professor as Industrial Consultant: Oliver Arnold and the British Steel Industry, 1900-14,\" ''Economic History Review,'' (Nov 1978) 31#4 pp 585-600</ref>\n\n===Coal===\nPolitics became a central issue for the coal miners, whose organization was facilitated by their location in remote one-industry villages. The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] formed in 1888, and counted 600,000 members in 1908. Much of the 'old left' of Labour politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas.<ref>Vic Allen, ''The militancy of British miners'' (1981).</ref>\n\n====General Strike of 1926====\n{{main|General Strike of 1926}}\nIn April 1926 the owners locked out the miners because they had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices caused by demand as oil started to replace coal.<ref>W.N. Medlicott, ''Contemporary England, 1914-1964'' (2nd ed. 1967) pp 223-30</ref> The general strike was led by the TUC for the benefit of coal miners, but it failed.  It was a nine-day nationwide walkout of one million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers supporting the 1.5 million coal miners who had been locked out. The government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. The TUC hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history and TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.<ref>Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \"The General Strike, 1926,\" Historical Journal (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001-1012 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638422 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], \"The General Strike,\" ''[[History Today]]'' (2006) 56#5 pp 40-47</ref> The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946.\n\nCoal continued as a sick industry as the best seams were used up and it became more and more difficult to mine the rest. The Labour government in 1947 nationalized coal into the National Coal Board, giving miners access to control of the mines via their control of the Labour party and the government.<ref>Ben Fine, ''The Coal Question: Political Economy and Industrial Change from the Nineteenth Century to the Present Day''  (1990).</ref> By then, however, the best seams had played out and coal mining was headed downward.  Coal production was 50 million metric tons in 1850, 149 million in 1880, 269 million in 1910, 228 million in 1940, and 153 million in 1970.  The peak year was 1913, with an output of 292 million tons. Mining employed 383,000 men in 1851, 604,000 in 1881, and 1,202,000 in 1911.<ref>B. R. Mitchell, ''European Historical Statistics'' (1975) pp 361-8, 163</ref>\n\n===New Industries===\nWhile Britain remained overly dependent on 'staple' heavy industries, the First World War had the advantage of stimulating production in new industries where the UK had lagged behind before 1914. Several of the new industries, including motorcars, chemicals, and rayon, were early recipients of tariff protection in the 1920s, prior to the [[Import Duties Act 1932]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varian|first=Brian D.|title=The growth of manufacturing protection in 1920s Britain|journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=0|issue=5|pages=703\u2013711|doi=10.1111/sjpe.12223|issn=1467-9485|year=2019}}</ref> The interwar years saw new technologies develop at a breakneck pace, creating lucrative new industries including automobile, airplane, and motorbike manufacture. Before the First World War, automobile manufacture in Britain had been a boutique industry limited to producing expensive luxury cars. The industry produced 34,000 vehicles for the year 1913; by 1937 over half a million were being produced.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=155}}</ref> Most of these were affordable models like the [[Austin 7]] (introduced 1921), the [[Morris Minor (1928)|Morris Minor]] (1928), as well as Model A and [[Ford Model Y|Model Y]] cars produced by [[Ford of Britain]]. The adoption of streamlined automation processes and the strong competition between manufacturers was responsible for a 50% drop in motorcar prices between the mid 20s and mid 30s, making cars more affordable (over 1 million were owned by 1930).<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain| author=Kenneth O. Morgan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2009| p=541}}</ref>\n\nThe chemicals industry, once dominated by Germany and the United States, also thrived in the UK during the interwar years. By 1939 it employed 100,000 people and produced fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=157}}</ref> Electrical engineering also mushroomed: the establishment of the [[Central Electricity Board]] in 1926 enabled a nationwide high-voltage electrical grid to be developed. By 1939 two thirds of homes had electricity supply, which in turn opened up a new consumer market for electrically powered appliances like vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, radios and stoves.<ref>{{cite book| title=A History of Britain: Liberal England, World War and Slump 1901-1939| authors=Carter & Mears| p=155}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1923 and 1938, the most successful new industries were: automobile production, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, metal goods, and printing. These created a net total of 557,920 new jobs between 1923 and 1938, some 96% of all new industrial jobs created in the interwar period.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\">{{cite article| url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0020859000000249| title=Women, Other ''Fresh'' Workers, and the New Manufacturing Workforce of Interwar Britain| publisher=International Review of Social History |volume= 45| year=2000| p=456}}</ref> These industries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the communities surrounding London and cities in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], particularly [[Coventry, England|Coventry]] and Birmingham, where there was an established workforce skilled in the production of high quality metal goods.<ref name=\"cambridge.org\"/>\n\n===1920s \"consumer boom\"===\nIn spite of the serious problems that plagued heavy industry, the 1920s marked an era of unprecedented growth for the British consumer industry, until then a minor player in the national economy. While not creating a fully-fledged \"consumer culture\" as in the United States during the same decade, it had an important effect over British society, primarily on the middle classes which gained access to commodities previously reserved for the upper crust, primarily automobiles, ownership rising tenfold during the interwar period (from around 500,000 in 1919 to approximately over 3 million in 1929 and 5 million in 1939). Sales of electric appliances boomed thanks to the rise of consumer-oriented credit and loans. Higher wages and shorter working hours also led to the rise of recreation: Gramophone records, radio (or \"the wireless\" as it was referred), magazines and cinema became part of everyday life much like sports, primarily football and cricket.\n\nTourism grew rapidly in the interwar years because of the rapidly rising number of motorized middle-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers, as well as an influx of American tourists. Seaside resorts like [[Blackpool]], [[Brighton]] and [[Skegness]] were particularly popular. However, those tourist sites that catered to the very wealthy (which now began holidaying abroad) or were located in depressed areas, all experienced a decline in profits, especially during the Great Depression.<ref>Rex Pope, \"A Consumer Service in Interwar Britain: The Hotel Trade, 1924-1938,\" ''Business History Review,'' (Winter 2000) 74#4 pp 657-82</ref>\n\nElectricity, gas, plumbing and telephone services became common as well during the decade, even in some working class households. However, those living in the most remote and poorest parts of Britain saw little change in their living standards, with many Britons still living in terraced homes with outdoor toilets as late as the 1960s.\n\n===1929\u20131939: the Great Depression===\n{{main|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10246, England, Arbeitslose vor Gewerkschaftshaus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930]]\nWhile the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall St Crash]] of 1929 had little direct impact on the British stock market, the collapse of the American economy which it had foretold and the associated contraction of world trade seriously affected Britain in the early 1930s.  Whereas British politicians had championed the concept of the free market when it was ascendant in the world economy, it gradually withdrew to adopting [[Tariff Reform]] as a measure of protectionism. In 1933 Sterling left the [[Gold Standard]]. By the early 1930s, the depression again signalled the economic problems the British economy faced. Unemployment soared during this period; from just over 10% in 1929 to more than 20% (or more than 3 million of the workforce) by early 1933. However, it had fallen to 13.9% by the start of 1936. While heavy industry sank to new lows, the consumer industry recovered by 1934 and production increased by 32% between 1933 and 1937. A good indication of the strong consumer market was the growth of retailers during the 1930s. [[Marks & Spencer]], for example, increased its turnover from \u00a32.5 million in 1929 to over \u00a325 million in 1939, necessitating the opening of dozens of new locations to serve the burgeoning demand in the suburbs.<ref name=\"Carter & Mears 2011\"/>\n\nIn 1929 [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed his second minority [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government. In political terms, the economic problems found expression in the rise of radical movements who promised solutions which conventional political parties appeared unable to provide. In Britain this was seen with the rise of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) and the Fascists under [[Oswald Mosley]]. However, their political strength was limited and unlike in the rest of Europe, the conventional political parties did not face a significant challenge. In 1931 the Labour Government resigned having failed to agree cuts in national expenditure, disagreeing over the extent of cuts in welfare payments, to be [[National_Government_(1931)|replaced]] by a McDonald-led [[National_Government_(United_Kingdom)|National Government]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], which provided the majority of its MPs, was returned to power in 1935.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Further|United Kingdom home front during World War II}}\nIn the [[Second World War]], 1939\u201345, Britain had a highly successful record of mobilising the [[home front]] for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.<ref>Robin Havers, ''The Second World War: Europe, 1939-1943'' (2002) Volume 4, p 75</ref>  Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.<ref>W.K.

In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the war effort, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.<ref>Peter Howlett, \"Resource allocation in wartime Britain: The case of steel, 1939-45,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History,'' (July 1994) 29#3 pp 523-44</ref> Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure.  The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940\u2014more than enough to cover the losses\u2014and Fighter Command emerged triumphantly from the Battle of Britain in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.<ref>Postan (1952), Chapter 4.</ref>  Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion<ref>Hancock, ''British War Economy'' [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-Stats-3.html online p 353]</ref>\n\nAfter war broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, Britain imposed [[exchange controls]]. The British Government used its [[gold reserves]] and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in early 1941 enacted [[Lend-Lease]], whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which never had to be repaid.<ref>There were some exceptions and $650 million was repaid.

The Labour government chose not to use the $2.7 billion (Germany received $1.7b) in aid for industrial modernization like Germany had. \nGermany rebuilt factories like the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg. Germany, France and Italy were fully re-engineered with all electric rail lines.  In Britain, steam engines, mechanical semaphore signalling and old track would remain into the 1960s. In addition, the road and telecommunications network in Britain remained equally inadequate, ill-maintained and out-of-date.\n\nBy 1950-1 the UK still spent 7.7% of GNP on defence while Germany and Japan spent nothing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnett |first1=Correlli |title=The Wasting of Britain's Marshall Aid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml |website=BBC History |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], just after the end of the war in Europe, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Clement Attlee]] was elected with a landslide majority (its first ever outright majority), introducing sweeping reforms of the British economy.

The economy went from strength to strength particularly after the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, still led by wartime leader [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] until he retired to make way for [[Anthony Eden]] just before his party's [[1955 United Kingdom general election|re-election in 1955]]. However, the Suez crisis of 1956 weakened the government's reputation and Britain's global standing, and prompted Eden to resign in early 1957 to be replaced by [[Harold Macmillan]].\n\nBy 1959, tax cuts had helped boost living standards and allow for a strong economy<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393287.stm|work=BBC News|title=1959: Macmillan wins Tory hat trick|date=5 April 2005}}</ref> and low unemployment, with October 1959 seeing the Tories win their third consecutive general election with a greatly increased majority, which sparked public and media doubt regarding Labour's chances of future election success.<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/unemployment|title=Unemployment|work=politics.co.uk}}</ref> Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell then drew a new economic plan for the party, heavily based on the success of the centralised industries of France and West Germany, by the 1960s the latter's economy surpassing the UK for the first time since 1915 as Europe's largest economy. Harold Wilson and Anthony Wedgwood Benn further developed the idea, becoming the backbone of the party's manifesto for the 1964 election.\n\nBritain's economy remained strong with low unemployment into the 1960s, but towards the end of the decade this growth began to slow and unemployment was rising again. [[Harold Wilson]], the Labour leader who had ended 13 years of Conservative rule with a narrow victory in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] before increasing his majority in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]], was surprisingly voted out of power in [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. The new Conservative government was led by [[Edward Heath]].\n\nDuring the 1970s Britain suffered a long running period of relative economic malaise, dogged by rising unemployment, frequent strikes and severe inflation, with neither the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]-[[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]] (led by [[Edward Heath]]) nor the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government which succeeded it (led by [[Harold Wilson]] and from 1976 [[James Callaghan]]) being able to halt the country's economic decline. Inflation exceeded 20% twice during the 1970s and was rarely below 10%.\n\nUnemployment exceeded 1 million by 1972 and had risen even higher by the time the end of the decade was in sight, passing the 1.5 million mark in 1978. The winter of 1978/79 brought a series of public sector strikes known as the [[Winter of Discontent]], leading to the collapse of Callaghan's Labour government in March 1979 (two years after it had lost the three-seat parliamentary majority won in October 1974).<ref name=\"politics.co.uk\"/>\n\nThis led to the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]], who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975. She cut back on the government's role in the economy and weakened the power of the [[trade union]]s. The final two decades of the 20th century saw an increase in service-providers and a drop in manufacturing and heavy industry, combined with [[privatisation]] of some sections of the economy. This change has led some to describe this as a 'Third Industrial Revolution', though this term is not widely used.\n\n===1945\u20131951: Age of Austerity===\nAfter the end of World War II, the British economy had again lost huge amounts of absolute wealth. Its economy was driven entirely for the needs of war and took some time to be reorganised for peaceful production. Britain's economic position was relatively strong compared to its devastated European neighbors - in 1947 British exports were equivalent in value to the combined exports of [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> Anticipating the end of the conflict, the [[United States]] had negotiated throughout the war to liberalise post-war trade and the international flow of capital in order to break into markets which had previously been closed to it, including the British Empire's [[Sterling area|Pound Sterling bloc]]. This was to be realised through the [[Atlantic Charter]] of 1941, through the establishment of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1944, and through the new economic power that the US was able to exert due to the weakened British economy.\n\n[[File:Winter 1947, snowbound bus, Castle Hill, Huddersfield - geograph.org.uk - 1668518.jpg|thumb|A snowbound bus in [[Huddersfield]], during the record-cold winter of 1946-47, which caused major fuel shortages and damaged Britain's fragile post-war economic recovery]]\nImmediately after the war in the Pacific ended, the U.S. halted [[Lend-Lease]], but did give the UK a [[Anglo-American loan|long-term low-interest loan of US$4.33bn]]. The winter of [[Winter of 1946-47 in the United Kingdom|1946\u20131947]] proved to be very harsh, with curtailed production and shortages of coal, which again affected the economy so that by August 1947, when convertibility was due to begin, the economy was not as strong as it needed to be. When the Labour Government enacted convertibility, there was a run on Sterling, as pounds were traded for dollars. This damaged the British economy and within weeks convertibility was abandoned. By 1949, the British pound was seen to be over valued and had to be devalued. The US dollar had become the world's premier currency.\n\nThe major economic priority of post-war Britain was to raise exports to fund he UK's dollar deficit. This required the extension of rationing, as British goods and produce were prioritized for export markets. Unlike Continental European countries, where rationing was abandoned within a few years of the wars' end, Britain actually tightened rationing restrictions and didn't fully abandon them until 1954.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref> The U.S. began [[Marshall Plan]] grants (mostly grants with a few loans) that pumped $3.3 billion into the economy and encouraged businessmen to modernize their approach to management.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947-1952'' (1989)</ref> Marshall Aid, however, failed to have the desired effect of modernizing industry and stimulating the economy, because 97% of the funds were used to service British debt repayments. This left the UK at a comparative disadvantage to rivals like [[France]] and [[West Germany]], who were able to invest the money directly into industry and infrastructure, creating more competitive, efficient economies in the long-term.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=163}}</ref>\n\n===Nationalisation===\nThe Labour Governments of 1945\u20131951 enacted a political programme rooted in [[collectivism]] that included the [[nationalisation]] of industries and state direction of the economy. Both wars had demonstrated the possible benefits of greater state involvement. This underlined the future direction of the post-war economy, and was also supported in the main by the Conservatives. However, the initial hopes for nationalisation were not fulfilled and more nuanced understandings of economic management emerged, such as state direction, rather than state ownership. With the extensive nationalisation programme achieved, Keynesian management of the UK economy was adopted.\n\nWith the postwar Labour Governments, the first comprehensive attempts at economic planning were made with initiatives intended to overhaul chronically depressed regions of the UK. The [[Distribution of Industry Act 1945]] designated \"development areas\" in northeast England, Scotland, and Wales according to the findings of the Barlow Report of 1940, which had recommended a complete economic overhaul of the troubled areas it pinpointed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Oxford Illustrated History of Britain|author=Kenneth O. Morgan| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2009| p=562\u2013563}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1950, the British government pumped some \u00a3300 million into the building of 481 new factories in these regions, to be leased to private industry. In addition there were 505 privately owned factories built in the troubled regions on the active encouragement of the government in London. This activity created an estimated 200,000 new jobs.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/tradeindustry/industrycommunity/overview/afterworldwar/| title=Programming redevelopment after World War II| author=parliament.uk| publisher=www.parliament.uk| access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of nationalizing the coal mines had been accepted in principle by owners and miners alike before the elections of 1945. The owners were paid \u00a3165,000,000. The government set up the [[National Coal Board]] to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it \u00a3150,000,000 to modernize the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945, there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 as they had been in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 it was clear that the country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with stock piles of 5 million tons too low. Nationalization exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.<ref>Mark Tookey,  \"Three's a Crowd?

Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. Unemployment was relatively low during this period, and the standard of living continued to rise, with more new private and council housing developments and the number of slum properties diminishing. Churchill and the Conservatives were back in power following the 1951 elections, but they largely continued the welfare state policies as set out by the Labour Party in the late 1940s.\n\n[[File:Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (14998200805).jpg|thumb|[[Butlins]] holiday camp in [[Pwllheli]], Wales in the 1950s. Holiday camps symbolized the newfound prosperity and leisure of postwar Britain]]\nDuring the \"golden age\" of the 1950s and 1960s, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned, Britons became more family centred.<ref>[[David Kynaston]], ''Family Britain, 1951\u20131957'' (2009)</ref> Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war. [[Holiday camp]]s, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s \u2013 and people increasingly had the money to pursue their personal hobbies. The [[BBC]]'s early television service was given a major boost in 1952 with the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950, just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.<ref>Peter Gurney, \"The Battle of the Consumer in Postwar Britain,\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (2005) 77#4 pp. 956\u2013987 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/499831 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nSmall neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by [[chain store]]s and [[shopping centre]]s, with their wide variety of goods, smart advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and [[ribbon development]]s springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the [[green belt]] to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.<ref>Willem van Vliet, ''Housing Markets & Policies under Fiscal Austerity'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, ed. ''A companion to contemporary Britain, 1939\u20132000''</ref> Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. In terms of consumption, there was more equality, especially as the landed gentry was hard pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. As a result of wage rises, consumer spending also increased by about 20% during the same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, the last food rations were ended in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthew Hollow|title='The Age of Affluence': Council Estates and Consumer Society|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=16|issue=1|pages=279\u2013296|url=https://www.academia.edu/1763989|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nEntitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.<ref>C.P. Hill, ''British Economic and Social History 1700\u20131964''</ref> For the young and unattached there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959, ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]'' magazine declared that \"Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living.\" Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] claimed that \"the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor.\"  As summed up by [[R. J. Unstead]],\n:\"Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and\\ the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.\"<ref>R.J. Unstead, ''A Century of Change: 1837\u2013Today'' (1963) p 224</ref>\n\nAs noted by historian Martin Pugh:\n:\"Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of \u00a38 a week in 1951 to \u00a315 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.\"<ref>Martin Pugh, ''Speak for Britain! A New History of the Labour Party'' (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8cIz32iH7BQC&pg=PA315&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false pp 115\u201316]</ref>\n\nThe number one selection for the housewife was a washing machine. Ownership jumped from 18 percent in 1955 to 29 percent in 1958, and 60 percent in 1966.<ref>Dominic Sandbrook, ''Never had it so good: a history of Britain from Suez to the Beatles'' (2005) p 112.</ref> By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.<ref>John Burnett, ''A Social History of Housing 1815\u20131985'' (1990) p 302</ref>\n\n===Relative Decline===\nFrom a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population.<ref>Brian Lapping, ''The Labour Government 1964\u201370''</ref> Education provision expanded, but not as fast as in neighbouring European countries. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with only 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan continued in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.<ref>David McDowall, ''Britain in Close-Up''</ref> In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.<ref>Anthony Sampson, ''The Essential Anatomy of Britain: Democracy in Crisis'' (1993) p 64</ref>\n\nIndustrial growth in Britain, while remaining steady through the 1950s, was not nearly as strong as on the continent. The statistics can be deceptive,  because Britain was far ahead of other European nations in terms of industrial development and urbanization. Countries like Italy, France and Spain, overwhelmingly agrarian in character at the end of the Second World War, were experiencing a process of rapid industrialization and urbanization Britain had already passed through in the 19th century. This approach is known as the \"early start theory\" among economists, and explains why European nations showed markedly stronger levels of absolute growth in industry compared to the UK, a country which was already transitioning into a post-industrial, service-based economy.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\">Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951 \u2013 1970'' (2009) p 305</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref> These countries had large surplus agricultural populations to draw into the cities to work in factories, while the UK as the most heavily urbanized nation in Europe had only a paltry 5% of the population employed on the land by 1945 (dropping to 2.7% by 1977). As such, the traditional source of new labour for low-wage factory work, rural farmers, was virtually non-existent in Britain and accordingly limited growth potential.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=327\u2013328}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a systemic malaise in British industry, which was famously inefficient and opposed to innovations. [[Tony Judt]] described the prevailing attitude of post-war industrialists: \"British factory managers preferred to operate in a cycle of under-investment, limited research and development, low wages and a shrinking pool of clients, rather than risk a fresh start with new products in new markets.\"<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=358}}</ref> The overriding emphasis placed on exports by the British government, in its effort to repair the nation's dollar deficit, made things worse, because it encouraged manufacturers to place all investment in expanding output, at the expense of updating machinery, introducing new technologies, improving production methods, etc. This policy was sustainable in the short-term, because in the late 1940s and early 50s world trade boomed and Britain, with its large and relatively undamaged industrial base, was in a uniquely advantageous position to satisfy demand. In 1950, 25% percent of world exports were British-made, and the total volume of British manufactured goods was double that of France and Germany combined.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=354\u2013357}}</ref> However, by the late 1950s, the economies of West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, had recovered from wartime infrastructure damage, replacing destroyed stock with state-of-the-art machinery and applying modern production methods in a process called \"rejuvenation by defeat\".<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> Continental governments actively encouraged recovery through direct investment/subsidies in targeted industries, in the case of Italy and France, or more widely through encouraging easy access to credit through national banks, a marked characteristic in France and West Germany. British industrialists saw no such intervention from their own government, which more or less left the private sector to itself.<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=357}}</ref> British goods were also more expensive abroad because of Sterling's overvaluation, but inferior in quality compared to the products flooding the world market from the United States, Germany and Italy.\n\nRapid decolonization in the British Empire through the late 1950s and 1960s dealt a further blow to British industry. Britain had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the consumer markets within the Empire, enforced by the closed Pound Sterling Bloc, but it could not compete once the territories gained independence and were free to negotiate their own trade agreements.\n\n====Suez Crisis====\nAlthough the '50s were overall a time of great prosperity for Britain, the [[Suez Crisis]] of November 1956 precipitated a financial crisis and a run on Sterling which underlined the fragility of post-war British finances.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite book| title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire| author=Lawrence James| year=1994|p=585}}</ref> The tripartite invasion of the [[Suez Canal Zone]] by Britain, France and Israel following Egypt's [[nationalisation]] of the [[Suez Canal Company]] (hitherto, a French company, albeit one with a majority share holding owned by the British government) was a disaster for British prestige and the economy. The United States and the United Nations came out firmly against the occupation, which caused a run on Sterling as foreign governments withdrew their holdings and converted them into either the US Dollar or gold. In the run up to the invasion \u00a3214 million was withdrawn by nervous investors and foreign governments. Britain's decision to freeze Egypt's holdings in response to the nationalization inspired panic in other foreign governments who feared their assets might be frozen if they supported the Egyptian cause. With the invasion a further \u00a3279 million was withdrawn, leaving a scarce \u00a31.965 billion left in Sterling reserves.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Within days Prime Minister Eden was appealing to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] for a $560 million loan, which was only granted on the condition that the country vacate the Canal Zone. This was agreed to, and Britain received a combined $1.3 billion in loans through the IMF and the American [[Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945| author=Tony Judt| year=2004| p=297}}</ref> British withdrawal from the Canal Zone was completed by 22 December, and the Pound returned to its pre-crisis parity with the Dollar by January 1957, but not without very nearly losing its value as an international reserve currency.\n\n===1960\u20131979: the Sixties and Seventies===\n{{See also|Three-Day Week|Winter of Discontent}}\n\n====Deindustrialization====\nDeindustrialization meant the closure of many operations in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = High | first = Steven | title = \"The wounds of class\": a historiographical reflection on the study of deindustrialization, 1973\u20132013 | journal = [[History Compass]] | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = 994\u20131007 | doi = 10.1111/hic3.12099 | date = November 2013 | ref = harv }}</ref> A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with older businesses shutting down and new ones opening up.

As negative factors coalesced during the 1960s, the slogan used by Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] \"(most of) our people have never had it so good\" seemed increasingly hollow. The Conservative Government presided over a \u2018stop-go\u2019 economy as it tried to prevent inflation spiralling out of control without snuffing out economic growth. Growth continued to be disappointing, at about only half the rate Germany or France achieved in the same period. \n\nIn comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), there was a common perception of continued relative economic decline; Britain slipped from seventh place in the world ranks of income per capita in 1950, to 12th in 1965, and to 20th in 1975. Labour politician [[Richard Crossman]], after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a:\n:sense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future.<ref name=\"Brian Harrison 2009 p 305\"/> \nEconomists provided four overlapping explanations. The \"early start\" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well relatively because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, structural change achieved in the UK in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the \"rejuvenation by defeat,\" whereby Germans and Japanese managers and politicians had been forced to reequip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of \"Imperial distractions\", whereby Britain's responsibilities to its extensive, though rapidly declining empire handicapped the domestic economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of \"institutional failure\" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed public schools, and universities perpetuating an elitist anti-industrial attitude while trade unions were regarded as traditionalist and conservative. .<ref>Harrison, ''Seeking a Role '' pp 305-6</ref>. An additional factor, perhaps a feature of the social traditionalism, was the alleged disappointing performance of British management.\n\n====Labour responds====\nThe result was a major political crisis, and a [[Winter of Discontent]] in the winter of 1978\u20131979 in during which there were widespread strikes by public sector unions that seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.<ref>Alwyn W.  Turner, ''Crisis?  What Crisis?  Britain in the 1970s'' (2008)</ref><ref>Andy Beckett, ''When the Lights Went Out: Britain in the Seventies'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZODPF6/ excerpt and text search].</ref>\n\nHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarized the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\n:If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callahan's  term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular ''modus vivendi'' with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that [[Mrs. Thatcher]] resoundingly defeated it in 1979.<ref>Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (4th ed. 1993)  p 324.</ref>\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] under [[Harold Wilson]] from 1964 to 1970 was unable to provide a solution either, and eventually was forced to devalue the pound again in 1967. Economist [[Nicholas Crafts]] attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor [[industrial relations]] and insufficient [[vocational training]]. He writes that this was a period of [[government failure]] caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism and a failure to confront interest groups.<ref name=\"Crafts\"/>\n\nBoth political parties had come to the conclusion that Britain needed to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in order to revive its economy. This decision came after establishing a [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) with other, non EEC countries since this provided little economic stimulus to Britain's economy. Levels of trade with the Commonwealth halved in the period 1945\u20131965 to around 25% while trade with the EEC had doubled during the same period. [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed a British attempt at membership in 1963 and again in 1967.\n\nThe [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election in June 1970]] saw the Conservatives, now led by [[Edward Heath]], achieve a surprise return to government after the opinion polls had suggested a third successive Labour victory. Unemployment was still low by this stage, standing at 3% nationally.  It was Heath who took the country into the EEC, in 1973.[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/brave_new_world/heath.htm]\n\nHowever, with the continuing relative decline of Britain's economy during the 1960s, management-labour relations deteriorated towards the end of the Wilson government and this worker discontent led to a dramatic breakdown of the industrial environment under the Conservative Government of Edward Heath (1970\u20131974). In the early 1970s, the British economy suffered even more as strike action by trade unions, especially successful action by the miners' union,  plus the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]], led to a [[Three-Day Week|three-day week]] in 1973-74. However, despite a brief period of calm negotiated by the recently re-elected Labour Government of 1974 known as the [[Social Contract (Britain)|Social Contract]], a breakdown with the unions occurred again in 1978, leading to the [[Winter of Discontent]], and eventually leading to the end of the Labour Government, then being led by [[James Callaghan]], who had succeeded Wilson in 1976.\n\nUnemployment had also risen during this difficult period for the British economy; unemployment reached 1.5 million in 1978 - nearly triple the figure of a decade earlier, with the national rate exceeding 5% for the first time in the postwar era. It had not fallen below 1 million since 1975, and has remained above this level ever since, rarely dropping below 1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15276765 | work=BBC News | title=Whatever happened to full employment? | date=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the 1970s, oil was found in the [[North Sea]], off the coast of Scotland, although its contribution to the UK economy was minimised by the need to pay for rising national debt and for welfare payments to the growing number of unemployed people.\n\n===1979\u20131990: the Thatcher era===\n{{see also|Thatcherism}}\nThe election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979 marked the end of the [[post-war consensus]] and a new approach to economic policy, including [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]],\nreform of industrial relations, and tax changes.

However, many of the economic policies put in place by the Thatcher governments have been kept since, and even the Labour Party which had once been so opposed to the policies had by the late 1990s, on its return to government after nearly 20 years in opposition, dropped all opposition to them.\n\nIndeed, the Labour Party of the 1980s had taken a shift to the left after the election of [[Michael Foot]] as leader in 1980, leading to a split in the party to form the centrist [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]], which formed an [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] and contested two general elections, with disappointing results, before merging in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The Conservatives were re-elected in 1983 and again in 1987, with a majority of more than 100 seats both times.\n\nBy the end of 1986, Britain was in the first stages of an economic boom, which saw unemployment fall below 3 million and reach a 10-year low of 1.6 million by December 1989. However, the rate of economic growth slowed down in 1989, with inflation approaching 10% and fears of an imminent recession being rife in the national media. Interest rates were increased by the government in an attempt to control inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2008/10/unemployment-in-uk.html|title=Economics Essays: Unemployment in the UK|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131997: the Major years===\nIn November 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down from the office of Prime Minister after losing first the confidence and then the support in Parliament of the Conservative Party's MPs, which she needed in order to continue. [[John Major]] was elected her successor. The government's popularity was also falling following the introduction of poll tax earlier that year, while unemployment was also starting to increase again as another recession loomed. Opinion polls were suggesting that the next general election could be won by Labour, led by [[Neil Kinnock]] since the resignation of Michael Foot in 1983.\n\nDespite several major economies showing quarterly detraction during 1989, the British economy continued to grow well into 1990, with the first quarterly detraction taking place in the third quarter of the year, by which time unemployment was starting to creep upwards again after four years of falling. The beginning of another recession was confirmed in January 1991. Interest rates had been increased between 1988 and 1990 to control inflation, which topped 10% in 1990 but was below 3% by the end of 1992.\n\nEconomic growth was not re-established until early 1993, but the Conservative government which had been in power continuously since 1979 managed to achieve re-election in April 1992, fending off a strong challenge from Neil Kinnock and Labour, although with a significantly reduced majority.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s recession was officially the longest in Britain since the Great Depression some 60 years earlier, though the fall in output was not as sharp as that of the downturn of the Great Depression or even that of the early 1980s recession. It had started during 1990 and the end of the recession was not officially declared until April 1993, by which time nearly 3 million people were unemployed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm | work=BBC News | title=1993: Recession over - it's official | date=26 April 1993}}</ref>\n\nThe British pound was tied to EU exchange rates, using the [[Deutsche Mark]] as a basis, as part of the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM); however, this resulted in disaster for Britain. The restrictions imposed by the ERM put pressure on the pound, leading to a run on the currency. [[Black Wednesday]] in September 1992 ended British membership of the ERM. It also damaged the credibility of the Conservative's reputation for economic competence, and contributed to the end of the 18 years of consecutive Conservative government in 1997. The party had long been divided over European issues and many of these rifts within the party had still not been mended by 1997.\n\nDespite the downfall of the Conservative government, it had seen a strong economic recovery in which unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since the end of 1992 to 1.7 million by the time of their election defeat just over four years later. Inflation also remained low, with the ERM exit in 1992 being followed by a gradual decrease in interest rates during the years that followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://econ.economicshelp.org/2007/03/economic-record-of-gordon-brown.html|title=Economics Essays: Economic Record of Gordon Brown.|author=Tejvan Pettinger|work=economicshelp.org}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132001: New Labour===\n{{see also|Blairism}}\nFrom May 1997, [[Tony Blair]]'s newly elected Labour government stuck with the Conservatives' spending plans. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], gained a reputation by some as the \"prudent Chancellor\" and helped to inspire renewed confidence in Labour's ability to manage the economy following the economic failures of earlier Labour governments. One of the first acts that the new Labour government embarked on was to give the power to set interest rates to the [[Bank of England]], effectively ending the use of interest rates as a political tool. Control of the banks was given to the Financial Services Agency.  Labour also introduced the [[minimum wage]] to the [[United Kingdom]], which has been raised every year since its introduction in April 1999. The Blair government also introduced a number of strategies to cut unemployment, including an expansion of the public sector. Unemployment was constantly below 1.5 million during the first half of the 2000s - a level not seen since the late 1970s, although the government never succeeded in getting unemployment back into the six figure tallies which were seen for most of the 30 years after the end of World War II.\n\n==21st century==\n{{Further|Economy of the United Kingdom}}\nIn the Labour Party's second term in office, beginning in 2001, when it achieved another landslide victory, the party increased taxes and borrowing. The government wanted the money to increase spending on public services, notably the [[National Health Service]], which they claimed was suffering from chronic under-funding. The economy shifted from manufacturing, which had been declining since the 1960s and grew on the back of the services and finance sectors, while the public sector continued to expand. The country was also at war with first [[Afghanistan]], invading in 2001 and then [[Iraq]], in 2003 - which proved controversial with the British public. Spending on both reached several billion pounds a year and the government's popularity began to slide, although it did manage to win a third general election under Blair in 2005 with a reduced majority. Blair stepped down two years later after a decade as prime minister to be succeeded by the former Chancellor Gordon Brown, the change of leader coming at a time when Labour was starting to lag behind the Conservatives (led by [[David Cameron]]) in the opinion polls.\n\nBy this stage, unemployment had increased slightly to 1.6 million although the economy continued to grow, the UK was continuing to lose large numbers of manufacturing jobs due to companies encountering financial problems or switching production overseas to save labour costs. This was particularly evident in the car industry, with [[General Motors]] ([[Vauxhall]]) and Ford having significantly cut back on UK operations, while [[Peugeot]] (the French carmaker who had bought the former [[Rootes Group]] and [[Chrysler Europe]] operations in the late 1970s) had completely withdrawn from Britain. These closures resulted in thousands of job losses, although the biggest single blow to the car industry came in 2005 when [[MG Rover]] went into liquidation; more than 6,000 jobs were lost at the carmaker alone and some 20,000 more were lost in associated supply industries and dealerships, not to mention the business failures and job cuts which befell businesses that had relied largely on trade from the carmaker's employees. This was the largest collapse of any European carmaker in modern times.\n\nGrowth rates were consistently between 1.6% and 3% from 2000 to early 2008. Inflation though relativity steady at around 2%, did rise in the approach to the financial crash. The Bank of England's control of interest rates was a major factor in the stability of the British economy over that period{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. The [[Pound Sterling|pound]] continued to fluctuate, however, reaching a low against the dollar in 2001 (to a rate of $1.37 per \u00a31), but rising again to a rate of approximately $2 per \u00a31 in 2007. Against the Euro, the pound was steady at a rate of approximately \u20ac1.45 per \u00a31. Since then, the effects of the [[Credit crunch]] have led to a slowdown of the economy. At the start of November 2008, for example, the pound was worth around \u20ac1.26; by the end of the year, it had almost approached parity, dropping at one point below \u20ac1.02 and ending the year at \u20ac1.04.\n\n===The 2008 recession and quantitative easing===\n{{Update section|date=June 2014}}\nThe UK entered a recession in Q2 of 2008, according to the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and exited it in Q4 of 2009.

The new government was faced with having to make deep public spending cuts over the following years in order to tackle the high level of national debt which had mounted up during Labour's response to the recession, which meant that unemployment remained high and the economy struggled to re-establish growth, although a marked improvement finally occurred in 2013 when economic growth and falling unemployment were sustained.\n\n[[Moody's]] maintained the UK's AAA credit rating in September 2010, forecasting stable finances largely driven by governmental action. It also reported that while the economy is flexible to grow in the future household debt repayments, a poor export market and the economy's large exposure to the finance sector were factors likely to sap growth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11373977 | work=BBC News | title=Moody's hails UK austerity effort | date=20 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent to that, the economy contracted in 5 of the next 7 quarters, thus ensuring zero net growth from the end of the recession at the end of 2009, through to the middle of 2012. In 2010, the economy picked up and growing steadily however in the summer the euro-zone crisis centred on Greece led to a second slow down in all European countries. The euro-zone entered a double dip recession that lasted from Q1 2011 until Q2 2013, and while the UK had no double dip recession it did however experience stagnant growth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17836624|work=BBC News|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=25 April 2012|title=UK economy in double-dip recession}}</ref> While the first half of 2012 saw inflationary pressures subside and business confidence increase, a number of fundamental weaknesses remain, most notably a decline in the productivity of British business.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ian-mason/the-productivity-problem_b_1765941.html|work=Huffington Post|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=13 August 2012|title=The Productivity Problem}}</ref>\n\nFrom Q2 2013, the UK's economy continued to grow for five consecutive quarters, the longest since Q1 of 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10613201|work=BBC News|date=29 April 2012|accessdate=9 June 2014|title=UK economy tracker: GDP}}</ref> showing growth beating most developed economies helped by the rebound in the housing market and strong growth in both manufacturing and services industries.

The most influential of these early company histories was [[Charles Wilson (historian)]]\u2019s ''History of Unilever'', the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples included Coleman's work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, Barker on Pilkington's and glass manufacture.<ref>John Wilson, and Steven Toms, J.S \u2018Fifty years of Business History\u2019, ''Business History'' (2008) 50#2 pp.125-26</ref><ref>. Leslie Hannah, \u2018New Issues in British Business History\u2019, ''Business History Review'' (1983) 57# 2, pp.165-174.</ref>  These early studies were conducted by primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1970s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. The Lancashire cotton textile industry, which had been the leading take-off sector in the industrial revolution, but which was slow to invest in subsequent technical developments, became an important topic of debate on this subject. [[William Lazonick]] for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Britain failed to develop larger integrated plants on the American model; a conclusion similar to Chandler's synthesis of a number of comparative case studies.<ref>Chandler, A., Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism, Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press (1990).</ref><ref>William Mass, & William Lazonick, \"The British Cotton Industry and International Competitive Advantage: the state of the debates,\" ''Business History,'' (1990) 32#4 pp. 9-65.</ref>\n\nStudies of British business leaders have emphasized how they fit into the class structure, especially their relationship to the aristocracy, and the desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and hereditary titles.<ref>Howard L. Malchow, ''Gentlemen capitalists: the social and political world of the Victorian businessman'' Stanford University Press, 19920.</ref><ref>William D.

Jeremy, ed., ''Dictionary of business biography: a biographical dictionary of business leaders active in Britain in the period 1860-1980'' (Butterworths, 1984).</ref>\nBritish business history began to widen its scope in the 1980s, with research work conducted at the LSE's Business History Unit, led first by Leslie Hannah, then by Terry Gourvish. Other research centres followed, notably at Glasgow and Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics. More recent editors of ''Business History'', [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)]](Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), John Wilson (Liverpool University Management School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) have promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. Employing these new themes has allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of Chandler and others about the performance of the British economy.<ref>Toms, Steven and Wilson, John F. \"Scale, Scope and Accountability: Towards a New Paradigm of British Business History,\" ''Business History'' (2003) 45#4 pp 1-23.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics|Money}}\n* [[Economy of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Poor Laws]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[European Single Market]]\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[History of England]]\n** [[History of Northern Ireland]]\n** [[History of Scotland]]\n** [[History of Wales]]\n* [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages]]\n* [[Economic history of Scotland]]\n* [[History of trade unions in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[English society]]\n* [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)]], includes some economic topics\n* [[History of company law in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of recessions in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Aldcroft |first=D.

It was based on other versions of Belgian TV series ''[[The Mole (TV series)|The Mole]]'' that have aired in numerous countries. ''The Mole'' was produced by Stone Stanley Entertainment for its first four seasons. It was canceled but was later picked up again after a four-year hiatus. The fifth season was produced by Stone & Co. Entertainment.\n\nThe series is a reality competition in which the contestants work as a group to add money to a pot that only one of them will eventually win. Among the contestants is one person who has been designated \"the [[Mole (espionage)|Mole]]\" by the producers and is tasked with sabotaging the group's money-making efforts. At the end of each episode, the contestant who knows the least about the mole, as decided by the results of a quiz, is eliminated from the game.\n\nThe series was first hosted by news reporter [[Anderson Cooper]]; for the third season, [[Ahmad Rash\u0101d]] replaced Cooper, and Rash\u0101d was in turn replaced by [[Jon Kelley]]<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/index?pn=hostbio#t=host The Mole \u2013 Host and Contestant Bios \u2013 ABC.com]</ref> for the fifth season. The third and fourth seasons featured celebrity contestants instead of average citizens. The series' logo is a bright green [[Fingerprint|thumbprint]].\n\n==Format==\n===Contestants===\nThe contestants typically meet for the first time at or shortly before the start of filming, shortly before their first task. They are given black [[duffel bag]]s with the show's thumbprint logo and their names on them in which to keep their belongings. Each is also given a numbered journal which is the only place they are permitted to record information and thoughts about the other contestants.\n\nSome contestants form \"[[coalition]]s\" with other contestants, ostensibly to share theories and observations about the other contestants. Some contestants attempt to cause others to believe that they are the Mole, on the premise that the deception may cause the others to fail the quiz and be eliminated from the show.\n\n===Missions===\nEach mission (referred to as \"tests\" in season 1 and as \"games\" in seasons 2\u20134) generally has a cash reward towards the group pot for various levels of success. On occasion, a mission will have a cash penalty for failure. The missions comprise a wide variety of physical and/or mental ([[brain teaser]]) challenges posed to the contestants. Most are straightforward, and the rules are fully explained to all contestants. In some cases, however, a mission is not fully explained to all contestants, increasing its difficulty. In those cases, perhaps only selected contestants are informed of the full nature of the challenge, and must work towards a different goal than the rest. In rare instances, there are secret missions which only one, or none of the contestants are aware of.\n\nMissions are sometimes entirely physical, or entirely mental, but usually, have elements of both. Overcoming fear is a common challenge theme, however, none of the missions have ever involved harmful actions (e.g. ingesting unsavory items as done in ''[[Fear Factor]]'') or explicitly unsafe stunts. Some missions have involved \"[[Extreme sport|extreme]]\" activities such as [[bungee jumping]], [[rappelling]], or [[tightrope walking]], but all are under strict expert supervision with proper harnessing.\n\nAnother common theme used in seasons 1, 2, 4, and 5, was use of the locale as an obstacle (such as overcoming a language barrier).\n\nSome missions require every member of the team to complete their task for the team to earn money, while other missions award money for each contestant that finished, regardless of the others. A common requirement is for the team to divide themselves into groups based on given attributes (e.g., \"leaders\" and \"followers\") before they learn what the task is.\n\nSecret missions may include \"morality tests,\" where the players might be unexpectedly approached by a local (secretly arranged by the producers), for help (i.e., change a tire, etc.) The contestants would later be informed that they won or lost the mission depending upon if they helped the person in need.\n\n===Penalties===\nIn addition to challenges, violations of the game's rules by a player, such as going out after curfew or talking about a forbidden topic, can result in a deduction from the group pot as a penalty.\n\nFailing a secret \"morality test\" may also warrant a penalty.\n\n===Quizzes & Execution===\nEach quiz follows the same basic format, asking either twenty or ten (depending on the season) questions about the identity of the Mole. Questions are in multiple-choice format with a widely varying number of choices; some questions have only two options (e.g. yes/no answer). The questions reflect upon a variety of observations about the Mole. Some ask about personal information (i.e., physical attributes, personal history, likes/dislikes, all collected from the original game applications). Other questions are based on in-game information (i.e., how the Mole performed in that day's mission). The final question of each quiz is ostensibly \"Who is the Mole?\", with all remaining players' names as options. The final question does not hold more weight than the others, and it is not unusual for players to miss that question, but still score well on the quiz.\n\nAfter dinner, all players (including those exempted from execution) complete the quiz in private on a computer. The Mole also completes the quiz so as to avoid suspicion. The player who has the lowest score on the quiz is eliminated from the game in an \"execution\" ceremony and are said to be \"executed by the Mole.\" If there is a tie for lowest score amongst two or more players, the tied player who completed the quiz in the slowest elapsed time would be executed. The Mole is always safe from execution and is guaranteed to be involved in the game until the very end, though he or she can never win.\n\nThe execution ceremony consists of the players sitting in rows of chairs before the host. In the first four seasons, the host had a [[laptop]] on which he typed each player's name, in no apparent order, one at a time. This caused a large television display of the thumbprint logo to turn either green or red, often after a tension-building pause. A green thumbprint indicated the player was safe. The red thumbprint signified the player as executed. For the fifth season, the laptop and screen were replaced with a single HDTV [[touchscreen]] display, showing thumbnail images of each contestant. The host touched the players' images to bring them up on the screen. For dramatic effect, the host would then often ask the contestant if he or she was ready for the results, then a second touch of the screen would reveal the same green or red thumbprint. None of the players are given any other information as to their performance on the test, aside from the one being executed.\n\n===Exemptions===\nContestants are sometimes awarded an '''Exemption''' from execution. An exempt contestant receives a free pass to the next round during that night's execution ceremony, and can not be eliminated, regardless of their quiz score. In the first season, exemptions were an occasional twist, while in the second through fifth seasons, exemptions were offered in almost every episode, and were highly coveted. Once awarded during gameplay, exemptions are announced publicly to the group and are otherwise not considered ''secret'' during the execution ceremony.\n\nEven after the first season, exemptions are usually twists in the game. In some cases, exemptions are awarded to a single player for an exceptional effort or performance during that day's task. Sometimes the exempted player is chosen by the group, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Other times, the exemption comes in the form of a temptation to not complete a task and forfeit money for the pot; or as an unexpected consolation prize for failure during a task.\n\nIn some cases, the exemption is a secret element to the day's game, revealed only to the player(s) eligible. A player(s) may find themselves surprisingly eligible to receive an exemption by carrying out simple, honest, coincidental acts such as being the last person to leave the breakfast table or eating the last piece of pie at dessert. Likewise, that player's ploy to achieving the exemption is often unbeknownst to the other players.\n\nIn the second season, there was an additional element called the \"neutralizer\" which prevented a contestant from being eligible for an exemption that episode.\n\n==Seasons==\n{{Location map+|World|width=600|float=right|caption=Locations of the American version of The Mole.|places=\n{{Location map~|World|lat=40|long=-100|label=[[United States]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=47|long=2|label=[[France]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=43.733333|long=7.416667|label=[[Monaco]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=40.433333|long=-3.7|label=[[Spain]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=46.8|long=8.233333|label=[[Switzerland]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=43|long=12|label=[[Italy]]|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=21.311389|long=-157.796389|label=[[Hawaii]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=20.833333|long=-89|label=[[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=-31.466667|long=-70.9|label=[[Chile]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=-37.183333|long=-67.366667|label=[[Argentina]]|position=right}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 1)}}\nThe first season of ''The Mole'' consisted of nine episodes, first aired from January 9, 2001 \u2013 February 28, 2001. It featured ten civilian contestants, one of whom was the Mole. The maximum possible value of the pot was $1,000,000, and each quiz consisted of twenty questions.\n\nThe contestants began the season in [[California]], and traveled to [[France]] in the first episode. The remainder of the season took place in [[Europe]], eventually traveling to [[Monaco]], and [[Spain]].\n\n===Season 2===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 2)}}\nSeason 2 of ''The Mole'' was subtitled ''The Next Betrayal''. Fourteen civilian contestants, one of whom was the Mole, competed over the course of 13 episodes. The first three episodes aired September 21 \u2013 October 12, 2001, before going on hiatus until the next summer, starting again from the first episode on May 24, 2002. The season again took place in Europe, mainly featuring [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. The maximum possible pot was again $1,000,000, but the quizzes were shortened to 10 questions. Various other minor format elements were changed for the second season.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 3)}}\nSeason 3 was billed ''Celebrity Mole: Hawaii'' and featured a cast of seven celebrities. The season, which was only six episodes long, was filmed on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawaii]]. The possible maximum jackpot was also reduced to $250,000. The season aired from January 8 \u2013 February 12, 2003.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{main| The Mole (American season 4)}}\nThe fourth season was billed ''Celebrity Mole: Yucatan'', and featured eight celebrity contestants, including two returning from the previous season. The season was again a short seven episodes long, and was filmed on the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]]. The season aired from January 7 \u2013 February 18, 2004.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 5)}}\n''The Mole'' returned after a four-year hiatus for a fifth season, returning to the civilian contestant format. Twelve contestants, one of whom was the mole, competed for a maximum pot of $500,000. The setting for this season was [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].  The season aired from June 2 \u2013 August 11, 2008. This season received an Emmy nomination for best theme song composition.\n\n===Future seasons===\nFollowing the conclusion of Season 5 of ''The Mole'', ABC did not comment on its consideration for a sixth season.   On April 8, 2009, they announced that the show had been cancelled.<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/index?pn=mb&cat=103544 The Mole \u2013 Message Boards \u2013 ABC.com]</ref> Fans have also created their own private site to encourage the signing of an online petition, e-mailing ABC executives, as well as sending \"lemon-heads\" to ABC headquarters in New York. (This is in reference to an occurrence on the fifth season of the show.) The latter of these techniques for being noticed is in reference to the successful revival of the television drama ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'' on [[CBS]] by bombarding their offices with packages of peanuts.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{imdb title|0270792|The Mole}}\n* {{tv.com show|the-mole|The Mole}}\n\n{{TheMole(US)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mole}}\n[[Category:2001 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:American television series based on Belgian television series]]\n[[Category:The Mole (TV series)|Mole US]]\n[[Category:Television series by Stone Stanley Entertainment]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = The Mole\n| image                = TheMole.jpg\n| show_name_2          = {{Plainlist|\n* ''The Mole: The Next Betrayal'' <small>(2002)</small>\n* ''Celebrity Mole: Hawaii'' <small>(2003)</small>\n* ''Celebrity Mole: Yucat\u00e1n'' <small>(2004)</small>\n}}\n| genre                = [[Reality television|Reality]] [[game show]]\n| creator              = \n| writer               =\n| director             = \n| creative_director    = \n| developer            = \n| presenter            = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Anderson Cooper]] <small>(2001\u201302)</small>\n* [[Ahmad Rash\u0101d]] <small>(2003\u201304)</small>\n* [[Jon Kelley]] <small>(2008)</small>\n}}\n| starring             = \n| voices               = \n| narrated             = \n| theme_music_composer = [[David Michael Frank]]\n| opentheme            = \n| endtheme             = \n| composer             = \n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 5\n| num_episodes         = 45\n| list_episodes        = \n| executive_producer   = \n| co_exec              = \n| producer             = \n| supervising_producer = \n| asst_producer        = \n| co-producer          = \n| editor               = \n| story_editor         = \n| location             = \n| cinematography       = \n| camera               = \n| runtime              = 43 minutes\n| company              = Stone Stanley Entertainment<br>(2001-2004)<br>(seasons 1-4)<br>Stone & Company Entertainment<br>(2008)<br>(season 5)<br>T.T.T.I/Woestijnvis Productions\n| distributor          = [[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]\n| network              = [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n| picture_format       = \n| audio_format         = \n| first_run            = \n| first_aired          = {{start date|2001|1|9}}\n| last_aired           = {{end date|2008|8|11}}\n| preceded_by          = \n| followed_by          = \n| related              = ''[[The Mole (TV series)|The Mole]]''\n| website              = http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/index?pn=index\n| production_website   = http://www.woestijnvis.be\n}}\n\n'''''The Mole''''' was an American [[Reality television|reality]] [[game show]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Some missions have involved \"[[Extreme sport|extreme]]\" activities such as [[bungee jumping]], [[rappelling]], or [[tightrope walking]], but all are under strict expert supervision with proper harnessing.\n\nAnother common theme used in seasons 1, 2, 4, and 5, was use of the locale as an obstacle (such as overcoming a language barrier).\n\nSome missions require every member of the team to complete their task for the team to earn money, while other missions award money for each contestant that finished, regardless of the others. A common requirement is for the team to divide themselves into groups based on given attributes (e.g., \"leaders\" and \"followers\") before they learn what the task is.\n\nSecret missions may include \"morality tests,\" where the players might be unexpectedly approached by a local (secretly arranged by the producers), for help (i.e., change a tire, etc.) The contestants would later be informed that they won or lost the mission depending upon if they helped the person in need.\n\n===Penalties===\nIn addition to challenges, violations of the game's rules by a player, such as going out after curfew or talking about a forbidden topic, can result in a deduction from the group pot as a penalty.\n\nFailing a secret \"morality test\" may also warrant a penalty.\n\n===Quizzes & Execution===\nEach quiz follows the same basic format, asking either twenty or ten (depending on the season) questions about the identity of the Mole. Questions are in multiple-choice format with a widely varying number of choices; some questions have only two options (e.g. yes/no answer). The questions reflect upon a variety of observations about the Mole. Some ask about personal information (i.e., physical attributes, personal history, likes/dislikes, all collected from the original game applications). Other questions are based on in-game information (i.e., how the Mole performed in that day's mission). The final question of each quiz is ostensibly \"Who is the Mole?\", with all remaining players' names as options. The final question does not hold more weight than the others, and it is not unusual for players to miss that question, but still score well on the quiz.\n\nAfter dinner, all players (including those exempted from execution) complete the quiz in private on a computer. The Mole also completes the quiz so as to avoid suspicion. The player who has the lowest score on the quiz is eliminated from the game in an \"execution\" ceremony and are said to be \"executed by the Mole.\" If there is a tie for lowest score amongst two or more players, the tied player who completed the quiz in the slowest elapsed time would be executed. The Mole is always safe from execution and is guaranteed to be involved in the game until the very end, though he or she can never win.\n\nThe execution ceremony consists of the players sitting in rows of chairs before the host. In the first four seasons, the host had a [[laptop]] on which he typed each player's name, in no apparent order, one at a time. This caused a large television display of the thumbprint logo to turn either green or red, often after a tension-building pause. A green thumbprint indicated the player was safe. The red thumbprint signified the player as executed. For the fifth season, the laptop and screen were replaced with a single HDTV [[touchscreen]] display, showing thumbnail images of each contestant. The host touched the players' images to bring them up on the screen. For dramatic effect, the host would then often ask the contestant if he or she was ready for the results, then a second touch of the screen would reveal the same green or red thumbprint. None of the players are given any other information as to their performance on the test, aside from the one being executed.\n\n===Exemptions===\nContestants are sometimes awarded an '''Exemption''' from execution. An exempt contestant receives a free pass to the next round during that night's execution ceremony, and can not be eliminated, regardless of their quiz score. In the first season, exemptions were an occasional twist, while in the second through fifth seasons, exemptions were offered in almost every episode, and were highly coveted. Once awarded during gameplay, exemptions are announced publicly to the group and are otherwise not considered ''secret'' during the execution ceremony.\n\nEven after the first season, exemptions are usually twists in the game. In some cases, exemptions are awarded to a single player for an exceptional effort or performance during that day's task. Sometimes the exempted player is chosen by the group, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Other times, the exemption comes in the form of a temptation to not complete a task and forfeit money for the pot; or as an unexpected consolation prize for failure during a task.\n\nIn some cases, the exemption is a secret element to the day's game, revealed only to the player(s) eligible. A player(s) may find themselves surprisingly eligible to receive an exemption by carrying out simple, honest, coincidental acts such as being the last person to leave the breakfast table or eating the last piece of pie at dessert. Likewise, that player's ploy to achieving the exemption is often unbeknownst to the other players.\n\nIn the second season, there was an additional element called the \"neutralizer\" which prevented a contestant from being eligible for an exemption that episode.\n\n==Seasons==\n{{Location map+|World|width=600|float=right|caption=Locations of the American version of The Mole.|places=\n{{Location map~|World|lat=40|long=-100|label=[[United States]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=47|long=2|label=[[France]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=43.733333|long=7.416667|label=[[Monaco]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=40.433333|long=-3.7|label=[[Spain]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=46.8|long=8.233333|label=[[Switzerland]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=43|long=12|label=[[Italy]]|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=21.311389|long=-157.796389|label=[[Hawaii]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=20.833333|long=-89|label=[[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=-31.466667|long=-70.9|label=[[Chile]]|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|World|lat=-37.183333|long=-67.366667|label=[[Argentina]]|position=right}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 1)}}\nThe first season of ''The Mole'' consisted of nine episodes, first aired from January 9, 2001 \u2013 February 28, 2001. It featured ten civilian contestants, one of whom was the Mole. The maximum possible value of the pot was $1,000,000, and each quiz consisted of twenty questions.\n\nThe contestants began the season in [[California]], and traveled to [[France]] in the first episode. The remainder of the season took place in [[Europe]], eventually traveling to [[Monaco]], and [[Spain]].\n\n===Season 2===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 2)}}\nSeason 2 of ''The Mole'' was subtitled ''The Next Betrayal''. Fourteen civilian contestants, one of whom was the Mole, competed over the course of 13 episodes. The first three episodes aired September 21 \u2013 October 12, 2001, before going on hiatus until the next summer, starting again from the first episode on May 24, 2002. The season again took place in Europe, mainly featuring [[Switzerland]] and [[Italy]]. The maximum possible pot was again $1,000,000, but the quizzes were shortened to 10 questions. Various other minor format elements were changed for the second season.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 3)}}\nSeason 3 was billed ''Celebrity Mole: Hawaii'' and featured a cast of seven celebrities. The season, which was only six episodes long, was filmed on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island of Hawaii]]. The possible maximum jackpot was also reduced to $250,000. The season aired from January 8 \u2013 February 12, 2003.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{main| The Mole (American season 4)}}\nThe fourth season was billed ''Celebrity Mole: Yucatan'', and featured eight celebrity contestants, including two returning from the previous season. The season was again a short seven episodes long, and was filmed on the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]]. The season aired from January 7 \u2013 February 18, 2004.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{main|The Mole (American season 5)}}\n''The Mole'' returned after a four-year hiatus for a fifth season, returning to the civilian contestant format. Twelve contestants, one of whom was the mole, competed for a maximum pot of $500,000. The setting for this season was [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].  The season aired from June 2 \u2013 August 11, 2008. This season received an Emmy nomination for best theme song composition.\n\n===Future seasons===\nFollowing the conclusion of Season 5 of ''The Mole'', ABC did not comment on its consideration for a sixth season.   On April 8, 2009, they announced that the show had been cancelled.<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/index?pn=mb&cat=103544 The Mole \u2013 Message Boards \u2013 ABC.com]</ref> Fans have also created their own private site to encourage the signing of an online petition, e-mailing ABC executives, as well as sending \"lemon-heads\" to ABC headquarters in New York. (This is in reference to an occurrence on the fifth season of the show.)

He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016.

Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The political reorientation of Pilgrim also weakened the opposition towards the new king.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0001/bsb00016322/images/index.html?seite=427 |title= Gisela  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Otto zu Stolberg-Wernigerode    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Early reign===\n\n[[File:Adelaide, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia, Abbess of Gandersheim.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia, Abbess of Gandersheim]]\n[[File:Bad-Gandersheim-Stiftskirche-Seite-vorn.JPG|thumb|[[Collegiate Church]], [[Bad Gandersheim]], (from southwest)]]\n[[File:Bad Gandersheim - Stiftskirche - innen - Kirchenschiff.JPG|thumb|nave of [[Collegiate Church]], [[Bad Gandersheim]]]]\nConrad inherited a kingdom troubled by problems. The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as a successor of the empire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04818-5|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men must have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 after which Conrad the Younger no longer opposed Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish [[Ultramontanism|ultramontan]] protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After the offer was rejected, they approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]], who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nWhen the news of Henry's death spread, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]], built during the 5th century.<ref name=\"Morgan-Owenson1821\">{{cite book|author=Sydney Morgan-Owenson|title=Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lupQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA200|year=1821|publisher=H.

Pavia, had thanks to its strategic location on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France become an important commercial center. The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313 |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from [[Pavia]] traveled north to meet Conrad. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The event lasted seven days and was attended by Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and around 70 senior clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Rudolph of Burgundy's attendance suggested surprisingly good relations between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The 'Imperial Church System' of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   |journal= The Journal of Ecclesiastical History|volume= 33|issue= 3|pages= 347\u2013374|doi= 10.1017/S0022046900026245| accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

Mieszko fled to [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding of [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the sensible title ''\"king\"'' in favor of the traditional title ''\"duke\"'' and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The royal regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/102/4/1140/80981?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title= Medieval Russia 980\u20131584  |publisher= Oxford University Press | date= October 1, 1997 | author=Janet Martin    | accessdate= April 4, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBezprym's reign, however, was short. His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to conspire against him. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, which created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a [[hoftag|diet]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto, and Detric, another half brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.

Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country in his hand. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted.

Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne.

His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, as Henry deposed Oldrich and restored his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne.

[[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession.

Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire.

{{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role and [[Imperial Church System|organisation of the Church]] and the status and affairs of [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]]. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}<ref name=brit>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Conrad-II |title=  Conrad II Holy Roman emperor | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=   |author=Peter Munz   |accessdate= April 2, 2020  }}</ref>\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II eventually reconciled and he returned to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/><ref name=brit/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024.

Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him.

At [[Augsburg]] Conrad received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]]. Both men were brothers of former emperor Henry II and Conrad appointed them to highest office at his court. After visiting Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of emmpire's founder [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad needed to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' as he had assumed the German throne. The decade-old unsettled dispute on who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04818-5|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men must have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 after which Conrad the Younger no longer opposed Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants increasingly considered the idea of Frankish [[Ultramontanism|ultramontan]] protection against Saracen and Byzantine threats to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After the offer was rejected, they approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]], who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nWhen the news of Henry's death spread, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]], built during the 5th century.<ref name=\"Morgan-Owenson1821\">{{cite book|author=Sydney Morgan-Owenson|title=Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lupQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA200|year=1821|publisher=H.

Pavia, had thanks to its strategic location on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France become an important commercial center. The local merchants and aristocrats demanded the greatest possible autonomy from imperial control.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313 |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the ecclesiastical mission, a party of noblemen from [[Pavia]] traveled north to meet Conrad. According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German throne. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

During the festivities a power struggle between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna ensued and was settled in favor of Milan. Subsequently Conrad left Rome and toured south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the Southern Italian principalities of [[Principality of Capua|Capua]] and [[Principality of Salerno|Salerno]] and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees, that outlined the reorganisation of the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the explicit objective to bring the [[Patriarchate of Venice]] under imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the emperor addressed the matter acknowledging the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]] superior to the [[Patriarchate of Grado]], an ally of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Aquileian [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him patriarch in 1020. Conrad's action placed the patriarchate at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn May 1027 Conrad returned to Germany in order to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad asserted his right to appoint the new [[Duchy of Bavaria|Duke of Bavaria]]. He made the unprecedented decision of chosing his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], ignoring several suitable candidates who held valid claims to the fief.\n\nThe young prince assumed Bavarian rule on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree, that all imperial property in the duchy must be documented. This required the various counts and bishops to list and report all imperial property in their domains, castles and abbeys. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, who even claimed that Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property she had inherited from her deceased husband Emperor Henry II) belonged to him. These dubious claims to property and the excessive promotion of imperial authority over the ducal and clerical affairs throughout Bavaria caused, unsurprisingly, new tension between him and the German aristocracy.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}<ref name=brit/>\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|240px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\n[[File:Adalbero of Eppenstein, Duke of Carinthia and Margrave of Verona.jpg|thumb|Emperor Conrad disapproved of [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero's]] increasingly indiscreet and quasi-independent rule of his estates [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona|Verona]], that compromized the stability at the crossroads of the empire]]\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The 'Imperial Church System' of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   |journal= The Journal of Ecclesiastical History|volume= 33|issue= 3|pages= 347\u2013374|doi= 10.1017/S0022046900026245| accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

Mieszko fled to [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding of [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the sensible title ''\"king\"'' in favor of the traditional title ''\"duke\"'' and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The royal regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/102/4/1140/80981?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title= Medieval Russia 980\u20131584  |publisher= Oxford University Press | date= October 1, 1997 | author=Janet Martin    | accessdate= April 4, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBezprym's reign, however, was short. His extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to conspire against him. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, which created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding a [[hoftag|diet]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland among Mieszko, Otto, and Detric, another half brother. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.

Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric and reunited the whole country in his hand. Though Mieszko regained his territory, he still was opposed by the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not adopt Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as King. Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted.

Jaromir ruled only a small territory, however, as Poland had occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. During the following civil war, Mieszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Mieszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref><ref name=mie/>\n\nPoland did not stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Mieszko to the Polish throne.

His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was a complete success, as Henry deposed Oldrich and restored his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne.

Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by bestowing titles of eastern Bavarian lands in between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] to the Hungarian nobility.

[[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute.

Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire.

Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034.
