Written by [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]] and directed by [[Kevin Lima]], the film stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Rachel Covey]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal [[Disney Princess]], who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of [[New York City]]. ''Enchanted'' was the first Disney film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], instead of [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].\n\nThe film is both an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to, and a [[self-parody]] of, [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]], making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, [[traditional animation]], and [[computer-generated imagery]]. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of ''Enchanted'', with Menken also composing its score.\n\nThe animated sequences were produced at [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]] Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the [[London Film Festival]] before its [[wide release]] on November 21, 2007, in the United States. ''Enchanted'' was well-received critically, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=enchanted.htm |title=Enchanted |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |work=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It won three [[Saturn Awards]],  including [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Adams. ''Enchanted'' also received two nominations at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. A [[sequel]], titled ''Disenchanted'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[fairy tale]] kingdom of Andalasia, Narissa, queen of Andalasia and an evil [[Witchcraft|witch]], schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his [[Chivalric romance|true love]] and marries. She enlists her loyal henchman Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted by hunting trolls. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"[[happy ending|happily ever after]].\" She, her best [[chipmunk]] friend, Pip, and animal friends of the forest have made a homemade statue of her true love but have trouble putting lips on it. Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured [[troll]] to get rid of Giselle, but Edward rescues her just in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to be married the following day.\n\nDisguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where she is magically transformed into a 3D live-action version of herself and transported to New York [[Times Square]] in the human world, a place where there are no \"happily ever afters\". Giselle, frightened and confused, quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night in their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes Giselle is a princess.\n\nPip had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into live-action versions. But Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk \u2013 therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples (that will put whoever eats one to sleep until the clock strikes twelve, which will kill them) to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as he cannot speak and Edward is clueless. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons [[vermin]] to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy flowers and an invitation to the \"[[Costume party|King and Queen's Costume Ball]]\" at the [[Woolworth Building]].\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and finally marry, she suggests that they should first go on a date and get to know each other better, still conflicted about her feelings. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after ending their date at the ball, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel fails twice to poison her. Robert and Giselle share a dance with each other and look into each other's eyes romantically. Giselle and Edward then prepare to leave, but Giselle feels sorrow at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising \"sweet dreams and happy endings.\" Giselle takes a bite and is plunged into a deep sleep with mere minutes to live.\n\nNarissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realising Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realises that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and Edward and Nancy prompt Robert to kiss her instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue [[dragon]] and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.\n\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy falling in love and marrying in Andalasia; Giselle running a successful \"Andalasian fashion\" business; while Nathaniel and Pip (who returns to Andalasia) each become successful authors about their experiences in the real world and find girlfriends. Giselle, still in the real world, married Robert and forms a happy family with him and Morgan.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Andalasia===\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Giselle <br> A princess-to-be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality.

After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''Enchanted'' is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in ''Roger Rabbit''; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s; it begins in 2.35:1 when the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo and ''Enchanted'' storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the animated sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the [[pillarbox]]ed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> ''Enchanted'' took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n====Animation====\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in [[Traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] (in contrast to computer-generated [[3-D animation]]) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' (2005).

The first song played in the film, \"True Love's Kiss\", was written to be \"a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features\", namely, \"I'm Wishing\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'') and \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved.<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\">{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=Menken & Schwartz Are \"Enchanted\"; Plus Bosco, Chenoweth, \"Hairspray\" |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |work=Playbill |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108225856/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 }}</ref> It posed a challenge for Menken and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] because of the \"many preconceptions with that number\"; it had to be reflective of the era of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Amy Adams Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212716/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBoth \"[[Happy Working Song]]\" and \"[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]\" also pay tributes to past Disney songs. \"Happy Working Song\" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), \"The Work Song\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), \"[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]\" (''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'') and \"Making Christmas\" (''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''), and a musical homage to the [[Sherman Brothers]] (with a self-parodic \"Alan Menken style\" middle eight). \"That's How You Know\" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as \"[[Under the Sea]]\" (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') and \"[[Be Our Guest]]\" (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'').<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/> To achieve this, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] admitted he had to \"push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics\" while maintaining \"the classic Walt Disney sensibility\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been \"a little tongue-in-cheek\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad \"[[So Close (Jon McLaughlin song)|So Close]]\" and the country/pop number \"Ever Ever After\" (sung by [[Carrie Underwood]] as a voice-over).<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/>\n\nOut of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film.

These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with [[wire removal]]s and composites.

The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CG rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes.

This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \"every conceivable angle\", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and Furrocious.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/> When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\">{{Cite news|first=Ron |last=Magid |title=A new wrinkle in the face of evil |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/02/entertainment/ca-enchanted2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have.<ref name=\"TCGSociety-2007dec4\"/> During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/>\n\nUnlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/><ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the [[Woolworth Building]] while clutching Robert in her claws, a [[greenscreen]] rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements.

Written by [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]] and directed by [[Kevin Lima]], the film stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Rachel Covey]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal [[Disney Princess]], who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of [[New York City]]. ''Enchanted'' was the first Disney film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], instead of [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].\n\nThe film is both an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to, and a [[self-parody]] of, [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]], making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, [[traditional animation]], and [[computer-generated imagery]]. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of ''Enchanted'', with Menken also composing its score.\n\nThe animated sequences were produced at [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]] Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the [[London Film Festival]] before its [[wide release]] on November 21, 2007, in the United States. ''Enchanted'' was well-received critically, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=enchanted.htm |title=Enchanted |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |work=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It won three [[Saturn Awards]],  including [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Adams. ''Enchanted'' also received two nominations at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. A [[sequel]], titled ''Disenchanted'', is in development.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[fairy tale]] kingdom of Andalasia, Narissa, queen of Andalasia and an evil [[Witchcraft|witch]], schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his [[Chivalric romance|true love]] and marries. She enlists her loyal henchman Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted by hunting trolls. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"[[happy ending|happily ever after]].\" She, her best [[chipmunk]] friend, Pip, and animal friends of the forest have made a homemade statue of her true love but have trouble putting lips on it. Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured [[troll]] to get rid of Giselle, but Edward rescues her just in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to be married the following day.\n\nDisguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where she is magically transformed into a 3D live-action version of herself and transported to New York [[Times Square]] in the real world, a place where there are no \"happily ever afters\". Giselle, frightened and confused, quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night in their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes Giselle is a princess.\n\nPip had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into live-action versions. But Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk \u2013 therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples (that will put whoever eats one to sleep until the clock strikes twelve, which will kill them) to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as he cannot speak and Edward is clueless. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons [[vermin]] to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy flowers and an invitation to the \"[[Costume party|King and Queen's Costume Ball]]\" at the [[Woolworth Building]].\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and finally marry, she suggests that they should first go on a date and get to know each other better, still conflicted about her feelings. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after ending their date at the ball, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel fails twice to poison her. Robert and Giselle share a dance with each other and look into each other's eyes romantically. Giselle and Edward then prepare to leave, but Giselle feels sorrow at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising \"sweet dreams and happy endings.\" Giselle takes a bite and is plunged into a deep sleep with mere minutes to live.\n\nNarissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realising Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realises that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and Edward and Nancy prompt Robert to kiss her instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue [[dragon]] and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.\n\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy falling in love and marrying in Andalasia; Giselle running a successful \"Andalasian fashion\" business; while Nathaniel and Pip (who returns to Andalasia) each become successful authors about their experiences in the real world and find girlfriends.

After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''Enchanted'' is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in ''Roger Rabbit''; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s; it begins in 2.35:1 when the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo and ''Enchanted'' storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the animated sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the [[pillarbox]]ed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> ''Enchanted'' took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/>\n\n====Animation====\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in [[Traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] (in contrast to computer-generated [[3-D animation]]) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref name=\"THR-2007nov14\"/> It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' (2005).

The first song played in the film, \"True Love's Kiss\", was written to be \"a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features\", namely, \"I'm Wishing\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'') and \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved.<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\">{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=Menken & Schwartz Are \"Enchanted\"; Plus Bosco, Chenoweth, \"Hairspray\" |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |work=Playbill |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108225856/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 }}</ref> It posed a challenge for Menken and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] because of the \"many preconceptions with that number\"; it had to be reflective of the era of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Amy Adams Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=2015-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212716/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBoth \"[[Happy Working Song]]\" and \"[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]\" also pay tributes to past Disney songs. \"Happy Working Song\" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), \"The Work Song\" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), \"[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]\" (''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'') and \"Making Christmas\" (''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''), and a musical homage to the [[Sherman Brothers]] (with a self-parodic \"Alan Menken style\" middle eight). \"That's How You Know\" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as \"[[Under the Sea]]\" (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') and \"[[Be Our Guest]]\" (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'').<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/> To achieve this, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] admitted he had to \"push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics\" while maintaining \"the classic Walt Disney sensibility\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been \"a little tongue-in-cheek\".<ref name=\"MO-music\"/> As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad \"[[So Close (Jon McLaughlin song)|So Close]]\" and the country/pop number \"Ever Ever After\" (sung by [[Carrie Underwood]] as a voice-over).<ref name=\"Playbill-2007nov18\"/>\n\nOut of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film.

These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with [[wire removal]]s and composites. [[Reel FX Creative Studios]] did four visual effects shots involving the pop-up book page-turn transitions while [[Weta Digital]] did two.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=3458&page=1 |title=Enchanted: Conjuring Fairytale VFX |accessdate=January 3, 2008 |last=Wolff |first=Ellen |date=November 21, 2007 |work=VFXWorld}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the animals that appear in the \"[[Happy Working Song]]\" sequence, the only real animals filmed on set were rats and pigeons. The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CG rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes. On the other hand, all the cockroaches were CG characters.<ref name=\"TCGSociety-2007dec4\">{{cite web|url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4351 |title=Sweet Enchanted Satire |access-date=January 3, 2008 |last=Robertson |first=Barbara |date=December 4, 2007 |work=The Computer Graphics Society}}</ref>\n\nPip, a chipmunk who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \"every conceivable angle\", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and Furrocious.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/> When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\">{{Cite news|first=Ron |last=Magid |title=A new wrinkle in the face of evil |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/02/entertainment/ca-enchanted2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=December 20, 2008}}</ref> To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have.<ref name=\"TCGSociety-2007dec4\"/> During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/>\n\nUnlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain.<ref name=\"VFXWorld-2007nov21\"/><ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch.<ref name=\"LAT-2007dec02\"/> When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the [[Woolworth Building]] while clutching Robert in her claws, a [[greenscreen]] rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref> \n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system. The difference is that it was right-of-centre in the Sunshine State and it is left-of-centre here in Victoria.[...] I don\u2019t think Aborigines were treated as prejudicially by even the worst of 19th-century judges.\"<ref name=\"travesty\">[https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/travesty-of-justice-trusted-institutions-fail-pell-public/news-story/04a4dabedeb056f5c6d83d37fed07f01 Travesty of justice: \u2018trusted\u2019 institutions fail Pell, public]; The Australian; 11 April 2020</ref> \n\nThe Victoria Police have been criticised for failing to properly test the accusations against Pell by interviewing relevant witnesses prior to laying charges. They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

{"title_page": "Fear of medical procedures", "text_new": "Most people suffer from a form of '''fear of medical procedures''' during their life. There are many different aspects of this fear and not everyone has every part. Some of these parts include fear of surgery, fear of dental work, and fear of doctors. These fears are often overlooked, but when a patient has one to the extreme it can be very damaging to their health.\n\nFormally, '''medical fear''' is defined as \"any experience that involves medical personnel or\nprocedures involved in the process of evaluating or modifying health status in traditional health care settings.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Measurement of Nursing Outcomes|editor=Carolyn F. Waltz |editor2=Colleen Dilorio |editor3=Ora L. Strickland|chapter=The Child Medical Fear Scale|pages=197|author1=Marion E. Broome  |author2=Teri Mobley |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=0-8261-1427-X}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nFear of medical procedures can be classified under a broader category of \u201cblood, injection, and injury phobias\u201d. This is one of five subtypes that classify specific phobias.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\">Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy pg 5</ref> A specific phobia is defined as a \u201cmarked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence (or anticipation) of a specific object or situation.\u201d<ref>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994)</ref><ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 79</ref> Often these fears begin to appear in childhood, around the age of five to nine.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\" /> It is normal to become squeamish at the sight of blood, injury, or gross deformity,<ref>Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 376</ref> but many overcome these fears by the time they reach adulthood. Those who do not are more likely to avoid medical and dental procedures necessary to maintain health, jobs, etc.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\" /> Research shows that when people encounter something that they have a specific phobia of many of them have a feeling of disgust<ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 82\n</ref> which makes them not want to come near or experience the object or situation which is disgusting to them. This feeling of disgust, especially in the blood, injection, and injury phobias may be passed down in families.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\" /> Women have been known to avoid becoming pregnant because it requires blood and medical examinations that they would rather avoid.<ref name=\"FearsPhobias\">Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 377\n</ref> Also, most phobic people have an increased heart rate upon encountering the thing they fear, but blood, injection, injury phobic people also seem to have an increase of fainting after the initial speeding up of heart rate. Their heart rate will go up and then slow again, leading to nausea, sweating, pallor, and fainting.<ref name=\"FearsPhobias\" /> This fainting can also lead to seizures, making life very difficult for those who have this fear.<ref>Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 378</ref> However, only 4.5% of individuals who have this phobia as a child will have this fear their entire lifetime.<ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 84</ref>\nFor those who do experience this phobia in an extreme manner, specific coping treatments have been found to help them. Biological treatments, such as medications used for other anxiety ailments, are generally found to be inappropriate for fear of medical procedures or other specific phobias. Psychological treatments are the treatment of choice because they are more accurate at addressing the problem. Some of these treatments used especially for fear of medical procedures include exposure-based treatments, [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]], and applied tension to react against fainting.<ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 98-102</ref>\n\n==Fear of surgery==\nFear of surgery or other invasive medical procedure is known as tomophobia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Markus|last2=Wolf|first2=Robert C|last3=Freudenmann|first3=Roland W|last4=Sch\u00f6nfeldt-Lecuona|first4=Carlos|date=2009-11-18|title=Tomophobia, the phobic fear caused by an invasive medical procedure - an emerging anxiety disorder: a case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=3|pages=131|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-3-131|issn=1752-1947|pmc=2803803|pmid=20062769}}</ref> Fear of surgery is not a fear experienced often, but is still just as harmful as other phobias that are more common. Since surgery is not a common occurrence, the fear is based on inexperience or something that is out of the ordinary.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This fear is one of those categorized under all fears of medical procedures that can be experienced by anyone, all ages, and have little need for actual psychological treatment, unless it is uncharacteristically causing the patient to react in a way that would be harmful to his or her health.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Children===\nFear of surgery is common among young children. Christine Gorman, of Kids and Surgery, states \u201cSurgery is scary enough for adults. But imagine what goes through the mind of a three-year-old when he sees a doctor or nurse all suited up and wearing a surgical mask: \u201cIt\u2019s a monster! It\u2019s got big eyes and no mouth! It\u2019s taking me away from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d No wonder half of all children from ages of 2 to 10 show evidence of distress\u2014from bed-wetting to nightmares\u2014for at least two weeks after their operation. Some of them remain traumatized even six months later.\u201d<ref name=\"Kidsand\">Kids and Surgery by: Gorman, Christine, Time, 0040781X, 06/07/99, Vol. 153, Issue 22</ref> This statement shows that the fear that comes when young children go into surgery can be a serious matter because they are still traumatized by the effects for weeks after the surgery has taken place. Being scared of surgery has led to \u201ceating disorders, sleep disturbances, regression to earlier levels of behavior, depression, and somatizations such as loss of voice after tonsillectomy.\u201d <ref>The Children\u2019s Surgical Worries Questionnaire: Reliability and Validity of a New Self-Report Measure, (Fosson, Martin & Haley, 1990; Setterstro:m, 1984)\n</ref> Many children see surgery as a form of punishment<ref name=\"Kidsand\" /> and, since they sometimes can\u2019t see what they did \u201cwrong\u201d, the fear is escalated, leaving greater chance for a longer effect on the psychological and emotional feelings of the child.\nMany ways have been tried to help children overcome this fear, including their parents and doctors simply telling them that the surgery won\u2019t hurt, or sedatives given by the doctor to minimize the feelings of anxiety later.<ref name=\"Kidsand\" /> There are certain types of treatments that have been proven to be better methods than others. Some hospitals allow parents to come into the surgery room and stay with the child, calming them until the anesthetic has taken effect. This is noted to keep anxiety down for both the parent and the child.<ref>Assuaging Children\u2019s Fear of Surgery, by Linda Saslow The New York Times, January 7, 1990\n</ref> If the child can enter the surgery calmly, there is much less of a chance that they will have many complications after the surgery due to fear.<nowiki>Other ways to treat the fear of surgery for children include having a doctor explain to them what the surgery is going to do and acting out the operation on a doll or stuffed animal.</nowiki><ref name=\"Kidsand\" /> <nowiki>This makes the surgery something less scary and able to be understood in the child\u2019s mind. When the surgery is understood by the child, the fear of the unknown is less of a factor of how scared the child will be, and how much that will impact their reaction to the surgery. </nowiki>\n\n===Adults===\nChildren are not the only ones to express fear of surgery, or have after effects that can affect the mental and physical well being of the person. Adults most fear the pain they expect to receive from the surgery. \u201cThe Roche Pain Management Survey polled 500 Americans, 27% of whom had surgery during the previous five years. Of those who had surgery, 77% reported pain afterwards, with four out of five of those saying they experienced moderate to extreme pain. 70%, indicated they experienced pain even after receiving medication; 80% reported they received pain medication on time, although 33% had to ask for it; and 16% had to wait for medication.\u201d<ref>Surgery Patients\u2019 Number-One Fear. USA Today Magazine, 01617389, Feb96, Vol. 124, Issue 2609\n</ref> Unlike children, adults seem to have less fear of the surgery itself, but rather fear of the effects of surgery.\n\nMilano and Kornfeld in 1980 said \u201cAny operation is a destructive invasion of the body and therefore frightens many patients\u201d.<ref name=\"Fearof\">Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346, pg.1339\n</ref> Some operations seem to invoke more fear from patients than others. Aged persons who require cataract surgery often fear the procedure, even though success is very likely. The fear of going blind because of the surgery is more apparent in women, who over all fear surgery more than men.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346pg.1339 (Paddison, Strain, Strain & Strain, 1989)\n</ref> The cataract is a disease that attacks the lens, causing it to swell until sight becomes obscured.<ref name=\"Fearof\" /> Operation is recommended when the disease begins to hamper everyday activities.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339- 1346, pg. 1340</ref> Even though becoming blind was the only option without the surgery, over 25% of the patients were afraid of becoming blind as a result of the surgery: 34% feared the failure of the operation.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346, pg. 1342\n</ref> Ritva Fagerstr\u00f6m, concerning the fears of cataract operation said, \u201cThese fears are understandable as the condition of the retina was not known in advance,\u201d <ref name=\"Fearof_a\">Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1349, pg. 1344</ref>  Two women out of 75, taking part in a study dealing with the fear of cataract operation felt that the experience of the first operation was so bad that they would not agree to have the second eye operated on.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1349, pg. 1345</ref> If a patient had this fear, understandable, and did not go through with the surgery, the blindness that would follow would keep them from being able to do normal things, easily leading them into situations of depression, or other dangerous situations which would be destructive to their overall health.\nWays to overcome this fear are specific to the individual. Often adults seem to become less fearful when given more information about the surgery, those who will be performing it, or the things to expect during recovery; 69% said that they had received much information and half of the patients trusted the ophthalmologist to do his best.<ref name=\"Fearof_a\" /> Although adults have less fear of surgery than children, the impact of this fear can still be just as great for both. Fear of surgery no matter who has it can be harmful to the patient if not taken care of properly before the surgery.\n\n==Fear of dental work==\n{{main|Dental fear}}\nFear of surgery is not the only fear based on medical procedures that can be harmful to the health of those who experience it; fear of dental work can also be dangerous if taken to an extreme. [[Dental fear]] has been ranked fifth among the most common fears. (DeJongh, Morris, Schoemakers, & Ter Horst, 1995)<ref name=\"Dentalfear_a\">Dental fear: Comparisons Between Younger and Older Adults, M. Michelle Rowe, PhD American Journal of Health Studies: 20(4) 2005 pg. 219-224\n</ref> Those who start with dental fear when they are young and continue with it into adulthood can have total avoidance of all dental work, causing problems for their health.<ref name=\"DentalFear\">Dental Fear in Children- a proposed model, H.R. Chapman and N.C. Kirby-Turner, British Dental Journal, Vol. 187, No.8 October 23, 1999\n</ref> Fear of dental care is often diagnosed using a fear measurement instrument like Corah\u2019s Dental Anxiety Scale or the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale.\n\n===Children===\nDental fear in children varies from 3%-21% depending on age and method used to measure dental fear.<ref name=\"DentalFear\" /> \u201cA very young child may find the smells of a dental surgery and the sounds of the equipment working very overwhelming\u201d says H.R. Chapman and N. C. Kirby-Turner.<ref name=\"DentalFear\" /> Such overwhelming situations can make a child afraid and if the fear is not corrected, it can become harder to get the child to participate in dental procedures.\n\nSome forms of treatment for children who do experience dental fear include allowing the family to come into the room with them to allow the child to see that the other members of the family are not scared, allowing the child to have time to explore the room and the equipment used on them, under the supervision of the dentist, to become familiar with the things surrounding them.<ref name=\"DentalFear\" /> Other methods include tell-show-do, [[positive reinforcement]], distraction, nonverbal communication or even general anesthesia and conscious sedation.<ref>A Controlled Trial of the impact of exposure to positive images of dentistry on anticipatory dental fear in children, C. Fox and J.T. Newton, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology 2006; 34: 455-459</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nWhen fear of dental work is not overcome in childhood it is very likely to continue into adulthood, causing a total avoidance of dental visits, which can lead to poor hygiene and lack of proper care for their teeth.  Both age and gender have huge differences in how people express and deal with their fear of dental work. Overall women express a fear of dental procedures more than men.<ref name=\"Genderdifferences\">Gender differences in reported dental fear and fear of dental pain, Marc W. Heft, Xiaoxian Meng, Margaret M. Bradley and Peter J. Lang Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology 2007; 35: 421-428\n</ref> Although dental anxiety is shown to be lower in men than in women, men expect more pain from the procedure.<ref name=\"Genderdifferences\" /> This expectance of pain leads many to miss appointments and be unwilling to seek professional help for simple things like toothaches. These simple things can lead to larger problems resulting in decaying teeth and poorly cared for gums. Age also makes a difference in how dental work is dealt with. Dental fear in young adults (ages 18\u201323) is significantly higher than fear in adults (ages 26\u201379)<ref name=\"Dentalfear_a\" /> showing that over the years, with maturity the fear of dental work decreases. Still many are making appointments and breaking them or not making them at all, leading to a deterioration of their dental condition.<ref name=\"Dentalfear_a\" />\n\nTreatment for this medical fear is similar to that of the treatment of adults who suffer from fear of surgery. Explanations of what is going on can help, also dentists speaking to patients with less embarrassing wording (such as calling what they have a phobia or treating them like a child while discussing their problem) to encourage them to express and cope with their dental fear.<ref name=\"Genderdifferences\" />\n\n==Fear of doctors and fear of needles==\nTwo of the most common fears of medical procedures are the fear of doctors and the fear of needles. These simple fears, when not overcome by patients, either by themselves or with medical help, can cause great problems in the future for their health.\n\n===Fear of doctors===\nPeople of all ages deal with fear of doctors (iatrophobia). Children often express fear by trying to hide from doctors when their parents take them in for checkups or by trying to avoid going to the doctor by not telling their parents when they don\u2019t feel well. This fear as a child can be easily treated in much the same way that doctors deal with children in surgery. An explanation or example (like seeing the doctor check an older sibling, or a stuffed animal) can help a child feel more comfortable with what the doctor will do for them.\n\nFear of doctors for adults can be extreme. Avoidance of visiting a doctor can lead to problems with not only short term but also long term health. There is a medical condition called [[white coat hypertension]] that deals with the raising of high blood pressure while in the presence of doctors.<ref>White coat Hypertension: how should it be diagnosed? E O\u2019Brien Journal of Human Hypertension 1999 13, 801-802</ref> Such high blood pressure is not good for health considerations, so this fear leads to more complications in health aspects of life for those who deal with it.\n\n===Fear of needles===\n{{main|Fear of needles}}\nThe [[fear of needles]] (also known as trypanophobia) is sometimes a complex condition that can cause serious health problems that may sometimes result in the death of the patient.<ref name=\"hamilton\">{{cite journal | author= James G. Hamilton| title= Needle Phobia - A Neglected Diagnosis | journal= Journal of Family Practice|date=August 1995| volume= 41| issue = 2 | pages = 169\u2013175 REVIEW |pmid = 7636457}}</ref> Some needle phobics refuse to receive shots that are mandatory, thus leading to greater risk of getting certain diseases, and many avoid treatment for serious medical conditions. Needle phobia is unique in the fact that it is a phobia that is documented to have resulted directly in the deaths of a few patients.<ref name=\"hamilton\"/> In the New England Journal of Medicine, Lountzis and Rahman published an article about a 34-year-old woman who had a growth on her fingers that doctors were unable to completely remove because of her fear of needles.<ref>Lountzis and Rahman 359 (2): 177, July 10, 2008 ''The New England Journal of Medicine''\n</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Articles used===\n* Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy\n* Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders\n* Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment\n* Kids and Surgery by: Gorman, Christine, Time, 0040781X, 06/07/99, Vol. 153, Issue 22\n* Assuaging Children\u2019s Fear of Surgery, by Linda Saslow The New York Times, January 7, 1990\n* The Children\u2019s Surgical Worries Questionnaire: Reliability and Validity of a New Self-Report Measure.\n* Surgery Patients\u2019 Number-One Fear.

There are many different aspects of this fear and not everyone has every part. Some of these parts include fear of surgery, fear of dental work, and fear of doctors. These fears are often overlooked, but when a patient has one to the extreme it can be very damaging to their health.\n\nFormally, '''medical fear''' is defined as \"any experience that involves medical personnel or\nprocedures involved in the process of evaluating or modifying health status in traditional health care settings.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Measurement of Nursing Outcomes|editor=Carolyn F.

This is one of five subtypes that classify specific phobias.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\">Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy pg 5</ref> A specific phobia is defined as a \u201cmarked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the presence (or anticipation) of a specific object or situation.\u201d<ref>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994)</ref><ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 79</ref> Often these fears begin to appear in childhood, around the age of five to nine.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\" /> It is normal to become squeamish at the sight of blood, injury, or gross deformity,<ref>Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 376</ref> but many overcome these fears by the time they reach adulthood. Those who do not are more likely to avoid medical and dental procedures necessary to maintain health, jobs, etc.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\" /> Research shows that when people encounter something that they have a specific phobia of many of them have a feeling of disgust<ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 82\n</ref> which makes them not want to come near or experience the object or situation which is disgusting to them. This feeling of disgust, especially in the blood, injection, and injury phobias may be passed down in families.<ref name=\"SpecificPhobias\" /> Women have been known to avoid becoming pregnant because it requires blood and medical examinations that they would rather avoid.<ref name=\"FearsPhobias\">Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 377\n</ref> Also, most phobic people have an increased heart rate upon encountering the thing they fear, but blood, injection, injury phobic people also seem to have an increase of fainting after the initial speeding up of heart rate. Their heart rate will go up and then slow again, leading to nausea, sweating, pallor, and fainting.<ref name=\"FearsPhobias\" /> This fainting can also lead to seizures, making life very difficult for those who have this fear.<ref>Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders pg 378</ref> However, only 4.5% of individuals who have this phobia as a child will have this fear their entire lifetime.<ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 84</ref>\nFor those who do experience this phobia in an extreme manner, specific coping treatments have been found to help them. Biological treatments, such as medications used for other anxiety ailments, are generally found to be inappropriate for fear of medical procedures or other specific phobias. Psychological treatments are the treatment of choice because they are more accurate at addressing the problem. Some of these treatments used especially for fear of medical procedures include exposure-based treatments, [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]], and applied tension to react against fainting.<ref>Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment pg 98-102</ref>\n\n==Fear of surgery==\nFear of surgery or other invasive medical procedure is known as tomophobia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Markus|last2=Wolf|first2=Robert C|last3=Freudenmann|first3=Roland W|last4=Sch\u00f6nfeldt-Lecuona|first4=Carlos|date=2009-11-18|title=Tomophobia, the phobic fear caused by an invasive medical procedure - an emerging anxiety disorder: a case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=3|pages=131|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-3-131|issn=1752-1947|pmc=2803803|pmid=20062769}}</ref> Fear of surgery is not a fear experienced often, but is still just as harmful as other phobias that are more common. Since surgery is not a common occurrence, the fear is based on inexperience or something that is out of the ordinary.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} This fear is one of those categorized under all fears of medical procedures that can be experienced by anyone, all ages, and have little need for actual psychological treatment, unless it is uncharacteristically causing the patient to react in a way that would be harmful to his or her health.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Children===\nFear of surgery is common among young children. Christine Gorman, of Kids and Surgery, states \u201cSurgery is scary enough for adults. But imagine what goes through the mind of a three-year-old when he sees a doctor or nurse all suited up and wearing a surgical mask: \u201cIt\u2019s a monster! It\u2019s got big eyes and no mouth! It\u2019s taking me away from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d No wonder half of all children from ages of 2 to 10 show evidence of distress\u2014from bed-wetting to nightmares\u2014for at least two weeks after their operation. Some of them remain traumatized even six months later.\u201d<ref name=\"Kidsand\">Kids and Surgery by: Gorman, Christine, Time, 0040781X, 06/07/99, Vol. 153, Issue 22</ref> This statement shows that the fear that comes when young children go into surgery can be a serious matter because they are still traumatized by the effects for weeks after the surgery has taken place. Being scared of surgery has led to \u201ceating disorders, sleep disturbances, regression to earlier levels of behavior, depression, and somatizations such as loss of voice after tonsillectomy.\u201d <ref>The Children\u2019s Surgical Worries Questionnaire: Reliability and Validity of a New Self-Report Measure, (Fosson, Martin & Haley, 1990; Setterstro:m, 1984)\n</ref> Many children see surgery as a form of punishment<ref name=\"Kidsand\" /> and, since they sometimes can\u2019t see what they did \u201cwrong\u201d, the fear is escalated, leaving greater chance for a longer effect on the psychological and emotional feelings of the child.\nMany ways have been tried to help children overcome this fear, including their parents and doctors simply telling them that the surgery won\u2019t hurt, or sedatives given by the doctor to minimize the feelings of anxiety later.<ref name=\"Kidsand\" /> There are certain types of treatments that have been proven to be better methods than others. Some hospitals allow parents to come into the surgery room and stay with the child, calming them until the anesthetic has taken effect. This is noted to keep anxiety down for both the parent and the child.<ref>Assuaging Children\u2019s Fear of Surgery, by Linda Saslow The New York Times, January 7, 1990\n</ref> If the child can enter the surgery calmly, there is much less of a chance that they will have many complications after the surgery due to fear.<nowiki>Other ways to treat the fear of surgery for children include having a doctor explain to them what the surgery is going to do and acting out the operation on a doll or stuffed animal.</nowiki><ref name=\"Kidsand\" /> <nowiki>This makes the surgery something less scary and able to be understood in the child\u2019s mind. When the surgery is understood by the child, the fear of the unknown is less of a factor of how scared the child will be, and how much that will impact their reaction to the surgery. </nowiki>\n\n===Adults===\nChildren are not the only ones to express fear of surgery, or have after effects that can affect the mental and physical well being of the person. Adults most fear the pain they expect to receive from the surgery. \u201cThe Roche Pain Management Survey polled 500 Americans, 27% of whom had surgery during the previous five years. Of those who had surgery, 77% reported pain afterwards, with four out of five of those saying they experienced moderate to extreme pain. 70%, indicated they experienced pain even after receiving medication; 80% reported they received pain medication on time, although 33% had to ask for it; and 16% had to wait for medication.\u201d<ref>Surgery Patients\u2019 Number-One Fear. USA Today Magazine, 01617389, Feb96, Vol. 124, Issue 2609\n</ref> Unlike children, adults seem to have less fear of the surgery itself, but rather fear of the effects of surgery.\n\nMilano and Kornfeld in 1980 said \u201cAny operation is a destructive invasion of the body and therefore frightens many patients\u201d.<ref name=\"Fearof\">Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346, pg.1339\n</ref> Some operations seem to invoke more fear from patients than others. Aged persons who require cataract surgery often fear the procedure, even though success is very likely. The fear of going blind because of the surgery is more apparent in women, who over all fear surgery more than men.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346pg.1339 (Paddison, Strain, Strain & Strain, 1989)\n</ref> The cataract is a disease that attacks the lens, causing it to swell until sight becomes obscured.<ref name=\"Fearof\" /> Operation is recommended when the disease begins to hamper everyday activities.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339- 1346, pg. 1340</ref> Even though becoming blind was the only option without the surgery, over 25% of the patients were afraid of becoming blind as a result of the surgery: 34% feared the failure of the operation.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1346, pg. 1342\n</ref> Ritva Fagerstr\u00f6m, concerning the fears of cataract operation said, \u201cThese fears are understandable as the condition of the retina was not known in advance,\u201d <ref name=\"Fearof_a\">Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1349, pg. 1344</ref>  Two women out of 75, taking part in a study dealing with the fear of cataract operation felt that the experience of the first operation was so bad that they would not agree to have the second eye operated on.<ref>Fear of Cataract Operation in Aged Persons, Ritva Fagerstro:m Psychological Reports, 1993, 72, 1339-1349, pg. 1345</ref> If a patient had this fear, understandable, and did not go through with the surgery, the blindness that would follow would keep them from being able to do normal things, easily leading them into situations of depression, or other dangerous situations which would be destructive to their overall health.\nWays to overcome this fear are specific to the individual. Often adults seem to become less fearful when given more information about the surgery, those who will be performing it, or the things to expect during recovery; 69% said that they had received much information and half of the patients trusted the ophthalmologist to do his best.<ref name=\"Fearof_a\" /> Although adults have less fear of surgery than children, the impact of this fear can still be just as great for both. Fear of surgery no matter who has it can be harmful to the patient if not taken care of properly before the surgery.\n\n==Fear of dental work==\n{{main|Dental fear}}\nFear of surgery is not the only fear based on medical procedures that can be harmful to the health of those who experience it; fear of dental work can also be dangerous if taken to an extreme. [[Dental fear]] has been ranked fifth among the most common fears. (DeJongh, Morris, Schoemakers, & Ter Horst, 1995)<ref name=\"Dentalfear_a\">Dental fear: Comparisons Between Younger and Older Adults, M. Michelle Rowe, PhD American Journal of Health Studies: 20(4) 2005 pg. 219-224\n</ref> Those who start with dental fear when they are young and continue with it into adulthood can have total avoidance of all dental work, causing problems for their health.<ref name=\"DentalFear\">Dental Fear in Children- a proposed model, H.R. Chapman and N.C. Kirby-Turner, British Dental Journal, Vol. 187, No.8 October 23, 1999\n</ref> Fear of dental care is often diagnosed using a fear measurement instrument like Corah\u2019s Dental Anxiety Scale or the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale.\n\n===Children===\nDental fear in children varies from 3%-21% depending on age and method used to measure dental fear.<ref name=\"DentalFear\" /> \u201cA very young child may find the smells of a dental surgery and the sounds of the equipment working very overwhelming\u201d says H.R. Chapman and N. C. Kirby-Turner.<ref name=\"DentalFear\" /> Such overwhelming situations can make a child afraid and if the fear is not corrected, it can become harder to get the child to participate in dental procedures.\n\nSome forms of treatment for children who do experience dental fear include allowing the family to come into the room with them to allow the child to see that the other members of the family are not scared, allowing the child to have time to explore the room and the equipment used on them, under the supervision of the dentist, to become familiar with the things surrounding them.<ref name=\"DentalFear\" /> Other methods include tell-show-do, [[positive reinforcement]], distraction, nonverbal communication or even general anesthesia and conscious sedation.<ref>A Controlled Trial of the impact of exposure to positive images of dentistry on anticipatory dental fear in children, C. Fox and J.T. Newton, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology 2006; 34: 455-459</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nWhen fear of dental work is not overcome in childhood it is very likely to continue into adulthood, causing a total avoidance of dental visits, which can lead to poor hygiene and lack of proper care for their teeth.  Both age and gender have huge differences in how people express and deal with their fear of dental work. Overall women express a fear of dental procedures more than men.<ref name=\"Genderdifferences\">Gender differences in reported dental fear and fear of dental pain, Marc W. Heft, Xiaoxian Meng, Margaret M. Bradley and Peter J. Lang Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology 2007; 35: 421-428\n</ref> Although dental anxiety is shown to be lower in men than in women, men expect more pain from the procedure.<ref name=\"Genderdifferences\" /> This expectance of pain leads many to miss appointments and be unwilling to seek professional help for simple things like toothaches. These simple things can lead to larger problems resulting in decaying teeth and poorly cared for gums. Age also makes a difference in how dental work is dealt with. Dental fear in young adults (ages 18\u201323) is significantly higher than fear in adults (ages 26\u201379)<ref name=\"Dentalfear_a\" /> showing that over the years, with maturity the fear of dental work decreases. Still many are making appointments and breaking them or not making them at all, leading to a deterioration of their dental condition.<ref name=\"Dentalfear_a\" />\n\nTreatment for this medical fear is similar to that of the treatment of adults who suffer from fear of surgery. Explanations of what is going on can help, also dentists speaking to patients with less embarrassing wording (such as calling what they have a phobia or treating them like a child while discussing their problem) to encourage them to express and cope with their dental fear.<ref name=\"Genderdifferences\" />\n\n==Fear of doctors and fear of needles==\nTwo of the most common fears of medical procedures are the fear of doctors and the fear of needles. These simple fears, when not overcome by patients, either by themselves or with medical help, can cause great problems in the future for their health.\n\n===Fear of doctors===\nPeople of all ages deal with fear of doctors (iatrophobia). Children often express fear by trying to hide from doctors when their parents take them in for checkups or by trying to avoid going to the doctor by not telling their parents when they don\u2019t feel well. This fear as a child can be easily treated in much the same way that doctors deal with children in surgery. An explanation or example (like seeing the doctor check an older sibling, or a stuffed animal) can help a child feel more comfortable with what the doctor will do for them.\n\nFear of doctors for adults can be extreme. Avoidance of visiting a doctor can lead to problems with not only short term but also long term health. There is a medical condition called [[white coat hypertension]] that deals with the raising of high blood pressure while in the presence of doctors.<ref>White coat Hypertension: how should it be diagnosed? E O\u2019Brien Journal of Human Hypertension 1999 13, 801-802</ref> Such high blood pressure is not good for health considerations, so this fear leads to more complications in health aspects of life for those who deal with it.\n\n===Fear of needles===\n{{main|Fear of needles}}\nThe [[fear of needles]] (also known as trypanophobia) is sometimes a complex condition that can cause serious health problems that may sometimes result in the death of the patient.<ref name=\"hamilton\">{{cite journal | author= James G. Hamilton| title= Needle Phobia - A Neglected Diagnosis | journal= Journal of Family Practice|date=August 1995| volume= 41| issue = 2 | pages = 169\u2013175 REVIEW |pmid = 7636457}}</ref> Some needle phobics refuse to receive shots that are mandatory, thus leading to greater risk of getting certain diseases, and many avoid treatment for serious medical conditions. Needle phobia is unique in the fact that it is a phobia that is documented to have resulted directly in the deaths of a few patients.<ref name=\"hamilton\"/> In the New England Journal of Medicine, Lountzis and Rahman published an article about a 34-year-old woman who had a growth on her fingers that doctors were unable to completely remove because of her fear of needles.<ref>Lountzis and Rahman 359 (2): 177, July 10, 2008 ''The New England Journal of Medicine''\n</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Articles used===\n* Specific Phobias: Clinical Applications of Evidence-Based Psychotherapy\n* Fears, Phobias, and Rituals: Panic, Anxiety and their Disorders\n* Phobic Disorders and Panic in Adults: A guide to Assessment and Treatment\n* Kids and Surgery by: Gorman, Christine, Time, 0040781X, 06/07/99, Vol. 153, Issue 22\n* Assuaging Children\u2019s Fear of Surgery, by Linda Saslow The New York Times, January 7, 1990\n* The Children\u2019s Surgical Worries Questionnaire: Reliability and Validity of a New Self-Report Measure.\n* Surgery Patients\u2019 Number-One Fear.
