From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nThe '''2nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry''' was a [[regiment]] of [[cavalry]] troops in the [[Union army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It consisted primarily of men from the states of [[California]] and [[Massachusetts]], and served in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], despite its western roots.\n\n==History==\nPoliticians at the start of the Civil War began raising volunteer troops in response to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call to arms to force the return of the [[Confederate States of America]] to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Owing to political divisions at the time of the Civil War and to the limited transportation facilities for moving troops great distances, the Lincoln administration did not request California troops for Eastern battlefields but instead called for volunteers to replace regular troops stationed at western garrisons. In the late summer of 1862, a small number of men in California who had been raised in the East decided to enlist in the army, but wanted to serve in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]]. They contacted Governor [[John Albion Andrew|John Andrew]] of Massachusetts in the late summer of 1862 and offered to raise a company of 100 cavalrymen to serve in a state regiment. Andrews agreed on the condition the Californians would provide their own uniforms and equipment and pay for their own passage to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. \n\nThe so-called \"California Hundred\" was organized in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on December 10, 1862, and took a ship to the East Coast, arriving at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], on January 4, 1863.<ref>{{cite book|last=McLean|first=James|title=California Sabers: the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry in the Civil War|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2000|isbn=0253337860|pages=7-9}}</ref> They were designated as Company A, and soon were joined by seven companies of Massachusetts. The Californians and four of the local companies were moved in mid-February to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], then to [[Fort Monroe]] and numerous other locations in [[Virginia]], where they primarily engaged in picketing, scouting, and outpost duty until July 1863. Commanded by [[James Sewall Reed]], the Californians first took to the field near [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. From July 1863 to July 1864, the California Hundred engaged in numerous skirmishes with [[John S. Mosby]]'s Confederate [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] rangers in the [[Loudoun Valley]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, another 400 Californians were recruited and sent to Massachusetts to form Companies E, F, L, and M (the \"California Battalion\") of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. They arrived in the Bay State on April 16, 1863, completing the full complement of the regiment. They moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in May and Colonel [[Charles Russell Lowell]] was given command.\n\nIn August 1863, the regiment was combined in [[Centreville, Virginia]], and became a part of King's Division in the [[XXII Corps (ACW)|XXII Corps]]. They later served in the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Union)|Army of the Shenandoah]] under [[Philip H. Sheridan]] during the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Among the many actions that the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry participated in were the battles of [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]], [[Battle of Opequon|Opequon]], [[Battle of Tom's Brook|Tom's Brook]], and [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]]. The following spring in 1865, by now under command of Colonel [[Caspar Crowninshield]], it participated in the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. In the subsequent [[Appomattox Campaign]] it pursued elements of the retreating [[Army of Northern Virginia]], then marched in the [[Grand Review of the Armies]] in Washington on May 23. The men were mustered out July 20, 1865, at [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax Court House, Virginia]], before returning to California and Massachusetts in the weeks that followed.\n\nThe regiment lost during its service 8 officers and 82 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 3 officers and 138 enlisted men by disease for a total of 231. Of the original California Hundred's 3 officers and 101 enlisted men, 40 were present the day the company disbanded. About 12 had died, others were discharged because of sickness or wounds or were transferred to other units, and 10 deserted, a greater desertion rate than from any other Massachusetts regiment.<ref>Colwell</ref>\n\nTwo men of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for gallantry in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. The two men were:\n* Private [[Philip Baybutt]] at [[Luray, Virginia]]\n* Captain [[Henry H.

From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nThe '''2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers''' was a [[regiment]] of [[cavalry]] troops in the [[Union army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It consisted primarily of men from the states of [[California]] and [[Massachusetts]], and served in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], despite its western roots.\n\n==History==\nPoliticians at the start of the Civil War began raising volunteer troops in response to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call to arms to force the return of the [[Confederate States of America]] to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Owing to political divisions at the time of the Civil War and to the limited transportation facilities for moving troops great distances, the Lincoln administration did not request California troops for Eastern battlefields but instead called for volunteers to replace regular troops stationed at western garrisons. In the late summer of 1862, a small number of men in California who had been raised in the East decided to enlist in the army, but wanted to serve in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]]. They contacted Governor [[John Albion Andrew|John Andrew]] of Massachusetts in the late summer of 1862 and offered to raise a company of 100 cavalrymen to serve in a state regiment. Andrews agreed on the condition the Californians would provide their own uniforms and equipment and pay for their own passage to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. \n\nThe so-called \"California Hundred\" was organized in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on December 10, 1862, and took a ship to the East Coast, arriving at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts]], on January 4, 1863.<ref>{{cite book|last=McLean|first=James|title=California Sabers: the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry in the Civil War|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2000|isbn=0253337860|pages=7-9}}</ref> They were designated as Company A, and soon were joined by seven companies of Massachusetts. The Californians and four of the local companies were moved in mid-February to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], then to [[Fort Monroe]] and numerous other locations in [[Virginia]], where they primarily engaged in picketing, scouting, and outpost duty until July 1863. Commanded by [[James Sewall Reed]], the Californians first took to the field near [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. From July 1863 to July 1864, the California Hundred engaged in numerous skirmishes with [[John S. Mosby]]'s Confederate [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] rangers in the [[Loudoun Valley]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, another 400 Californians were recruited and sent to Massachusetts to form Companies E, F, L, and M (the \"California Battalion\") of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. They arrived in the Bay State on April 16, 1863, completing the full complement of the regiment. They moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in May and Colonel [[Charles Russell Lowell]] was given command.\n\nIn August 1863, the regiment was combined in [[Centreville, Virginia]], and became a part of King's Division in the [[XXII Corps (ACW)|XXII Corps]]. They later served in the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Union)|Army of the Shenandoah]] under [[Philip H. Sheridan]] during the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Among the many actions that the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry participated in were the battles of [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]], [[Battle of Opequon|Opequon]], [[Battle of Tom's Brook|Tom's Brook]], and [[Battle of Cedar Creek|Cedar Creek]]. The following spring in 1865, by now under command of Colonel [[Caspar Crowninshield]], it participated in the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. In the subsequent [[Appomattox Campaign]] it pursued elements of the retreating [[Army of Northern Virginia]], then marched in the [[Grand Review of the Armies]] in Washington on May 23. The men were mustered out July 20, 1865, at [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax Court House, Virginia]], before returning to California and Massachusetts in the weeks that followed.\n\nThe regiment lost during its service 8 officers and 82 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 3 officers and 138 enlisted men by disease for a total of 231. Of the original California Hundred's 3 officers and 101 enlisted men, 40 were present the day the company disbanded. About 12 had died, others were discharged because of sickness or wounds or were transferred to other units, and 10 deserted, a greater desertion rate than from any other Massachusetts regiment.<ref>Colwell</ref>\n\nTwo men of the regiment were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for gallantry in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. The two men were:\n* Private [[Philip Baybutt]] at [[Luray, Virginia]]\n* Captain [[Henry H. Crocker]] at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Massachusetts Civil War Units]]\n*[[Massachusetts in the American Civil War]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*Bowen, James L.

Chemical data implied that the substance might be residual oil leaking from the wreckage. If that proves to be the case, the sheen can be expected to eventually disappear. Another possibility is that it is formation oil escaping from the subsurface, using the Macondo well casing as flow conduit, possibly intersecting a naturally occurring fault, and then following that to escape at the surface some distance from the wellhead. If it proves to be oil from the subsurface, then that could indicate the possibility of an indefinite release of oil.

In summer 2010, approximately 47,000&nbsp;people and 7,000&nbsp;vessels were involved in the project. By 3 October 2012, federal response costs amounted to $850&nbsp;million, mostly reimbursed by BP.  {{as of|2013|January|}}, 935&nbsp;personnel were still involved. By that time cleanup had cost BP over $14&nbsp;billion.<ref name=Ramseur/>\n\nIt was estimated with plus-or-minus 10% uncertainty that {{convert|4.9|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil was released from the well; {{convert|4.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil went into the Gulf.<ref name=\"AutoBB-153\"/> The report led by the Department of the Interior and the NOAA said that \"75% [of oil] has been cleaned up by Man or Mother Nature\"; however, only about 25% of released oil was collected or removed while about 75% of oil remained in the environment in one form or another.<ref name=\"AutoBB-149\"/> In 2012, Markus Huettel, a [[Benthic zone|benthic ecologist]] at Florida State University, maintained that while much of BP's oil was degraded or evaporated, at least 60% remains unaccounted for.<ref name=ng220312/>\n\nIn May 2010, a local native set up a network for people to volunteer their assistance in cleaning up beaches. Boat captains were given the opportunity to offer the use of their boat to help clean and prevent the oil from further spreading. To assist with the efforts the captains had to register their ships with the Vessels of Opportunity, however an issue arose when more boats registered than actually participated in the clean up efforts - only a third of the registered boats. Many local supporters were disappointed with BP's slow response, prompting the formation of The Florida Key Environmental Coalition.  This coalition gained significant influence in the clean up of the oil spill to try and gain some control over the situation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/florida-keys-environmentalists-act-protect-against-bp-oil-spill-summer-2010 |title=Florida Keys environmentalists act to protect against BP oil spill summer 2010 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Containment ===\n[[File:Tedx-oil-spill-0075.jpg|thumb|right|Oil containment boom used in an attempt to protect barrier islands]]\n[[Boom (containment)|Containment booms]] stretching over {{convert|4200000|ft|km}} were deployed, either to corral the oil or as barriers to protect marshes, mangroves, shrimp/crab/oyster ranches or other ecologically sensitive areas.

They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of the oil and they used [[sorbent]]s to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove the oil completely, chemicals called [[dispersant]]s are used to hasten the oil's degradation to prevent the oil from doing further damage to the marine habitats below the surface water. For the Deep Horizon oil spill, cleanup workers used {{convert|1400000|usgal}} of various chemical dispersants to further breakdown the oil.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gulf Oil Spill |url=http://ocean.si.edu/gulf-oil-spill |website=Smithsonian Ocean Portal |accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Louisiana was funded by BP to do regular testing of fish, shellfish, water, and sand.

Tests for chemical exposure in the seven fishermen were negative; NIOSH concluded that the hospitalizations were most likely a result of heat, fatigue, and terpenes that were being used to clean the decks. Review of 10 later hospitalizations found that heat exposure and dehydration were consistent findings but could not establish chemical exposure. NIOSH personnel performed air monitoring around cleanup workers at sea, on land, and during the application of Corexit. Air concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PAHs never exceeded permissible exposure levels. A limitation of their methodology was that some VOCs may have already evaporated from the oil before they began their investigation. In their report, they suggest the possibility that respiratory symptoms might have been caused by high levels of ozone or reactive aldehydes in the air, possibly produced from photochemical reactions in the oil. NIOSH did note that many of the personnel involved were not donning personal protective equipment (gloves and impermeable coveralls) as they had been instructed to and emphasized that this was important protection against transdermal absorption of chemicals from the oil.

The report also states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of a cement barrier allowing hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout.  The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last\u2010minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform.<ref name=\"BOERMEPR\"/>\n\n=== Spill response fund ===\n[[File:Administration Responds to BP Oil Spill (4584731287).jpg|thumb|President Barack Obama meets with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to discuss response to the spill.]]\n{{main|Gulf Coast Claims Facility}}\n{{see also|Kenneth Feinberg}}\n\nOn 16 June 2010, after BP executives met with President Obama, BP announced and established the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), a $20&nbsp;billion fund to settle claims arising from the Deepwater Horizon spill.<ref name=upstream170610/><ref name=\"McDonell\"/> This fund was set aside for natural resource damages, state and local response costs, and individual compensation, but could not be used for fines or penalties.<ref name=upstream170610/> Prior to establishing the GCCF, emergency compensation was paid by BP from an initial facility.<ref name=bdo/>\n\nThe GCCF was administrated by attorney [[Kenneth Feinberg]].

Another possibility is that it is formation oil escaping from the subsurface, using the Macondo well casing as flow conduit, possibly intersecting a naturally occurring fault, and then following that to escape at the surface some distance from the wellhead. If it proves to be oil from the subsurface, then that could indicate the possibility of an indefinite release of oil.

In summer 2010, approximately 47,000&nbsp;people and 7,000&nbsp;vessels were involved in the project. By 3 October 2012, federal response costs amounted to $850&nbsp;million, mostly reimbursed by BP.  {{as of|2013|January|}}, 935&nbsp;personnel were still involved. By that time cleanup had cost BP over $14&nbsp;billion.<ref name=Ramseur/>\n\nIt was estimated with plus-or-minus 10% uncertainty that {{convert|4.9|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil was released from the well; {{convert|4.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil went into the Gulf.<ref name=\"AutoBB-153\"/> The report led by the Department of the Interior and the NOAA said that \"75% [of oil] has been cleaned up by Man or Mother Nature\"; however, only about 25% of released oil was collected or removed while about 75% of oil remained in the environment in one form or another.<ref name=\"AutoBB-149\"/> In 2012, Markus Huettel, a [[Benthic zone|benthic ecologist]] at Florida State University, maintained that while much of BP's oil was degraded or evaporated, at least 60% remains unaccounted for.<ref name=ng220312/>\n\nIn May 2010, a local native set up a network for people to volunteer their assistance in cleaning up beaches. Boat captains were given the opportunity to offer the use of their boat to help clean and prevent the oil from further spreading. To assist with the efforts the captains had to register their ships with the Vessels of Opportunity, however an issue arose when more boats registered than actually participated in the clean up efforts - only a third of the registered boats. Many local supporters were disappointed with BP's slow response, prompting the formation of The Florida Key Environmental Coalition.  This coalition gained significant influence in the clean up of the oil spill to try and gain some control over the situation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/florida-keys-environmentalists-act-protect-against-bp-oil-spill-summer-2010 |title=Florida Keys environmentalists act to protect against BP oil spill summer 2010 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Containment ===\n[[File:Tedx-oil-spill-0075.jpg|thumb|right|Oil containment boom used in an attempt to protect barrier islands]]\n[[Boom (containment)|Containment booms]] stretching over {{convert|4200000|ft|km}} were deployed, either to corral the oil or as barriers to protect marshes, mangroves, shrimp/crab/oyster ranches or other ecologically sensitive areas.

Using physical barriers such as floating booms, cleanup workers' objective was to keep the oil from spreading any further. They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of the oil and they used [[sorbent]]s to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove the oil completely, chemicals called [[dispersant]]s are used to hasten the oil's degradation to prevent the oil from doing further damage to the marine habitats below the surface water. For the Deep Horizon oil spill, cleanup workers used {{convert|1400000|usgal}} of various chemical dispersants to further breakdown the oil.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gulf Oil Spill |url=http://ocean.si.edu/gulf-oil-spill |website=Smithsonian Ocean Portal |accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Louisiana was funded by BP to do regular testing of fish, shellfish, water, and sand.

This was to cover all offshore cleanup activities, BP later requested a second NIOSH investigation of onshore cleanup operations. Tests for chemical exposure in the seven fishermen were negative; NIOSH concluded that the hospitalizations were most likely a result of heat, fatigue, and terpenes that were being used to clean the decks. Review of 10 later hospitalizations found that heat exposure and dehydration were consistent findings but could not establish chemical exposure. NIOSH personnel performed air monitoring around cleanup workers at sea, on land, and during the application of Corexit. Air concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PAHs never exceeded permissible exposure levels. A limitation of their methodology was that some VOCs may have already evaporated from the oil before they began their investigation. In their report, they suggest the possibility that respiratory symptoms might have been caused by high levels of ozone or reactive aldehydes in the air, possibly produced from photochemical reactions in the oil. NIOSH did note that many of the personnel involved were not donning personal protective equipment (gloves and impermeable coveralls) as they had been instructed to and emphasized that this was important protection against transdermal absorption of chemicals from the oil.
