Noor was killed with a [[Stanley knife]] wielded by Charlotte and struck with a hammer by Linda following a confrontation with the sisters and their mother, Kathleen Mulhall. His head and penis were sliced off and the rest of his corpse dismembered by the women and dumped in [[Dublin]]'s [[Royal Canal]] where a piece of leg still wearing a sock was spotted floating near [[Croke Park]] ten days later.\n\nThe subsequent manhunt and the trial in October 2006 attracted intense media attention in Ireland as the true details of the crime slowly emerged. The sisters and their mother were arrested but released until Linda confessed to involvement in the crime. Kathleen Mulhall left the country at this point to live in England. When Charlotte and Linda were charged with murder in December 2005, their father, John Mulhall, hanged himself in [[Phoenix Park]]. As a result of the method they used to carry out the killing of Farah Swaleh Noor, Linda and Charlotte Mulhall were dubbed the ''Scissor Sisters'' by the media, after the pop rock band the [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref name=\"'Scissor' mother dated rapist after fleeing to UK\"/><ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/><ref name=\"Scissor Sister reveals head put in bins in Phoenix Park\"/> Justice [[Paul Carney]], presiding over the trial, said during sentencing that it was \"the most grotesque killing that has occurred in my professional lifetime\".<ref name=\"A horror story born out of dysfunction\"/> Charlotte Mulhall was given the mandatory life sentence and Linda Mulhall was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter, with both being sent to [[D\u00f3chas Centre|Mountjoy Women's prison]] in Dublin.\n\nNoor's head and penis were never recovered,<ref name=\"Mulhall sister sentenced to life (2)\"/> although Linda later admitted they had put the head in rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to [[Tallaght]] and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was [[sectioned]]. Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to [[Limerick]]. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges. She pleaded guilty to helping clean up the crime scene to conceal evidence and was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2009.\n\nThe case has resulted in several books and has been examined in at least one television series. It was said by the ''[[Irish Independent]]''{{'}}s legal affairs correspondent Dearbhail McDonald to have \"fuelled fears of ritual killings in Ireland\".<ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/>\n\n==Mulhall family background==\nThe Mulhalls were from Kilclare Gardens, a working class area in [[Tallaght]], south [[Dublin]]. Their parents John and Kathleen Mulhall raised a family of three boys and three girls. John Mulhall allegedly abused Kathleen. Their marriage broke down and Kathleen entered into a relationship with Farah Swaleh Noor in 2002. Noor moved into their family home with Kathleen, and John Mulhall took some of his children and moved out. He rented various accommodations in Dublin over a period of a year, then moved back into the home after Kathleen left and moved to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with Noor. Kathleen and Noor returned to Dublin in 2004. Noor allegedly subjected Kathleen Mulhall to regular beatings.<ref name=\"Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1018/ireland/cwidkfojeyql |title=Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer|date=18 October 2006 |publisher=breakingnews.ie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614133636/http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1018/ireland/cwidkfojeyql/ |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse\">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0506/1224245993737.html|title=Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=4 September 2009|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Linda Mulhall===\nLinda Mulhall was 30 years old at the time of the killing.

The abuse was later investigated, and the children were taken into care by the social services, while Wayne Kinsella served a six-year prison sentence for his cruelty to the children. Kinsella himself had an extremely violent history, having been thrown out of school for violent behaviour, according to his elder sister, Donna. In a 2013 [[RT\u00c9 Radio]] interview, Donna Kinsella said that her brother Wayne was always an extremely violent person, even during his childhood, and stated that he used to beat members of his own family, including his parents, and had broken her jaw on one occasion.<ref name=\"Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail\">{{cite web|author=Conor Feehan Security Editor|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/dont-ever-let-my-doublekiller-brother-out-of-jail/|title='Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail'|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=14 September 2016|publisher=[[Herald]]}}</ref>  In May 1996, Kinsella received an eight-year prison sentence for the murder of a retired auctioneer, Thomas Foreman, who was killed while visiting his wife's grave in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] in Dublin on 23 September 1995.

Subsequent investigations revealed that he was in fact [[Kenya]]n and that his family was still alive. Farah was ethnically [[Somalis|Somali]]. The [[Department of Justice and Equality|Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform]] ordered that he be deported but he appealed and was granted Irish citizenship in March 1999 on grounds he became the father of an Irish-born child. He had four previous convictions for offences including [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], threatening and abusive behaviour and assault. In 1997, he [[rape]]d a mentally disabled 16-year-old Chinese girl. She later gave birth to a son.

Farah bought [[vodka]] and Kathleen Mulhall purchased [[Coca-Cola]] which they drank as they walked around the city before stopping on the [[River Liffey]] Boardwalk where Charlotte and her mother took [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy tablets]]. They returned to Kathleen Mulhall's flat where the women took ecstasy.

Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to \"just kill him for me\". Charlotte picked up a [[Stanley knife]] and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that sent him to the ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but did not participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times.

Noor's head, [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s and [[penis]] were severed using a kitchen knife and hammer. They put towels over his legs to stem the flow of blood. The dismemberment took a number of hours and the body parts were placed in black plastic bags and a sports bag before being disposed of in the [[Royal Canal]]. This took the three women several trips. They decided not to throw the head in to prevent identification. The head was brought by bus to Tallaght where they walked through [[The Square, Tallaght|The Square Shopping Centre]] to Tymon North Park. They walked to where Charlotte dug a hole with a knife to bury the head. Kathleen Mulhall threw the knives and the hammer into a nearby pond. A number of days later, Linda Mulhall allegedly returned to the park and dug up the head. Using her son's schoolbag, she transferred it to a field in the Killinarden Estate, Tallaght, where she broke it up with a hammer before burying it again.<ref name=\"Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer\" />\n\n==Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na investigation==\nThe killing only came to light ten days later when Noor's leg, with a sock on the end, was seen floating in the canal, a few hundred yards from [[Croke Park]]. [[Garda Water Unit|Garda sub-aqua divers]] retrieved most of the rest of his body in seven parts. Garda\u00ed traced his identity through media appeals. Noor was only identified when someone recognised a T-shirt on the recovered torso.

Noor was killed with a [[Stanley knife]] wielded by Charlotte and struck with a hammer by Linda following a confrontation with the sisters and their mother, Kathleen Mulhall. His head and penis were sliced off and the rest of his corpse dismembered by the women and dumped in [[Dublin]]'s [[Royal Canal]] where a piece of leg still wearing a sock was spotted floating near [[Croke Park]] ten days later.\n\nThe subsequent manhunt and the trial in October 2006 attracted intense media attention in Ireland as the true details of the crime slowly emerged. The sisters and their mother were arrested but released until Linda confessed to involvement in the crime. Kathleen Mulhall left the country at this point to live in England. When Charlotte and Linda were charged with murder in December 2005, their father, John Mulhall, hanged himself in [[Phoenix Park]]. As a result of the method they used to carry out the killing of Farah Swaleh Noor, Linda and Charlotte Mulhall were dubbed the ''Scissor Sisters'' by the media, after the pop rock band the [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref name=\"'Scissor' mother dated rapist after fleeing to UK\"/><ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/><ref name=\"Scissor Sister reveals head put in bins in Phoenix Park\"/> Justice [[Paul Carney]], presiding over the trial, said during sentencing that it was \"the most grotesque killing that has occurred in my professional lifetime\".<ref name=\"A horror story born out of dysfunction\"/> Charlotte Mulhall was given the mandatory life sentence and Linda Mulhall was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter, with both being sent to [[D\u00f3chas Centre|Mountjoy Women's prison]] in Dublin.\n\nNoor's head and penis were never recovered,<ref name=\"Mulhall sister sentenced to life (2)\"/> although Linda later admitted they had put the head in rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to [[Tallaght]] and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was [[sectioned]]. Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to [[Limerick]]. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges. She pleaded guilty to helping clean up the crime scene to conceal evidence and was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2009.\n\nThe case has resulted in several books and has been examined in at least one television series. It was said by the ''[[Irish Independent]]''{{'}}s legal affairs correspondent Dearbhail McDonald to have \"fuelled fears of ritual killings in Ireland\".<ref name=\"Lengthy sentences for brutal sibling slayers\"/>\n\n==Mulhall family background==\nThe Mulhalls were from Kilclare Gardens, a working class area in [[Tallaght]], south [[Dublin]]. Their parents John and Kathleen Mulhall raised a family of three boys and three girls. John Mulhall allegedly abused Kathleen. Their marriage broke down and Kathleen entered into a relationship with Farah Swaleh Noor in 2002. Noor moved into their family home with Kathleen, and John Mulhall took some of his children and moved out. He rented various accommodations in Dublin over a period of a year, then moved back into the home after Kathleen left and moved to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with Noor. Kathleen and Noor returned to Dublin in 2004. Noor allegedly subjected Kathleen Mulhall to regular beatings.<ref name=\"Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1018/ireland/cwidkfojeyql/#ixzz0Q31lk3sr|title=Mulhall sister admits she hit victim with hammer|date=18 October 2006|accessdate=4 September 2009|publisher=breakingnews.ie}}</ref><ref name=\"Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse\">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0506/1224245993737.html|title=Composure breaks down as court hears litany of violence and abuse|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=4 September 2009|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Linda Mulhall===\nLinda Mulhall was 30 years old at the time of the killing.

Kinsella himself had an extremely violent history, having been thrown out of school for violent behaviour, according to his elder sister, Donna. In a 2013 [[RT\u00c9 Radio]] interview, Donna Kinsella said that her brother Wayne was always an extremely violent person, even during his childhood, and stated that he used to beat members of his own family, including his parents, and had broken her jaw on one occasion.<ref name=\"Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail\">{{cite web|author=Conor Feehan Security Editor|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/dont-ever-let-my-doublekiller-brother-out-of-jail/|title='Don't ever let my double-killer brother out of jail'|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=14 September 2016|publisher=[[Herald]]}}</ref>  In May 1996, Kinsella received an eight-year prison sentence for the murder of a retired auctioneer, Thomas Foreman, who was killed while visiting his wife's grave in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] in Dublin on 23 September 1995.

He served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 24 July 1963 until 14 April 1965. \n\nThe [[natural gas]] reserves, recently found in [[Slochteren]] were a considerable boost for the economy.

Despite this being the second cabinet without socialist [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], the building up of a [[welfare state]], that was started after [[World War II]], continued with the introduction of [[minimum wages]] in 1964 and the [[Universal health care|national health service]].

The cabinet finally fell over the issue if commercial TV should be allowed in the Netherlands.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1966 Marijnen was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] and concurrently chairman of the Board of the Rijnmond Authority. In 1967 he was also appointed chairman of the Post and Telecommunications Council.

In 1941 he graduated in law from the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] and went on to work in the accountancy divisions of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]]. In 1945 he was seconded to the Council for the Restitution of Legal Rights.\n\nIn 1949 Marijnen became secretary of the Agricultural Society and in 1951 Secretary-General of the Foreign Agricultural Trade Department of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]]. From 1957 he was secretary of the General Catholic Employers Association and the Catholic Federation of Employers Associations.\n\n[[File:Lyndon B Johnson in Holland De vice-president en premier Marijnen op Ypenburg, Bestanddeelnr 915-7144.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Prime Minister Victor Marijnen and [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B.

According to the ''Telegraph'' newspaper, reporting in March 2012, he \"intervened to have prison sentences dropped against several priests convicted of abusing children.\"<ref name=\"Protecting paedophile priests\">{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9153676/Dutch-Roman-Catholic-Church-castrated-at-least-10-boys.html | title=Dutch Roman Catholic Church 'castrated at least 10 boys' | publisher=Telegraph | accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref> The Dutch Catholic Church organised the [[castration]] of Heithuis while he lived at the Gelderland children's home in 1956 after he reported being sexually abused to the police.<ref name=\"Protecting paedophile priests\"/>\n\n===Politics===\nIn the [[De Quay cabinet]], Marijnen was [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality|Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries]]. He served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 24 July 1963 until 14 April 1965. \n\nThe [[natural gas]] reserves, recently found in [[Slochteren]] were a considerable boost for the economy. This, combined with [[labour shortage]] led to a rise in wages and the attraction of foreign workers. Despite this being the second cabinet without socialist [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]], the building up of a [[welfare state]], that was started after [[World War II]], continued with the introduction of [[minimum wages]] in 1964 and the [[Universal health care|national health service]]. In 1965, measures were taken against [[commercial television]] stations transmitting from the [[North Sea]]. The cabinet finally fell over the issue if commercial TV should be allowed in the Netherlands.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1966 Marijnen was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] and concurrently chairman of the Board of the Rijnmond Authority. In 1967 he was also appointed chairman of the Post and Telecommunications Council. On 16 October 1968 he was selected [[List of mayors of The Hague|Mayor of The Hague]].\n\nMarijnen died on 5 April 1975 in [[The Hague]], while serving as Mayor from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 58.\n\n==Decorations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=5 |'''Honours'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!

He was a disciple of the [[Dvaita]] philosopher-saint [[Vyasatirtha]], and a contemporary of yet another [[Haridasa]], [[Kanakadasa]]. His guru, Vyasatirtha, glorified Purandara Dasa in a song thus: ''D\u0101sarendare purandara d\u0101sarayya''. He was a composer, singer and one of the chief founding-proponents of South Indian classical music ([[Karnatiac music]]). In honor of his significant contributions to Karnatic music, he is widely referred to as the ''Pitamaha'' (''lit''. \"father\" or \"grandfather\") of Karnatic music.<ref name=\"iyer\"/><ref name=\"Thielemann\"/><ref name=\"MA1991\"/><ref name=\"oldest\"/> He is respected as an ''[[Avatar]]a'' (incarnation) of the great sage [[Narada]] (a celestial being who is also a singer).\n\nPurandara Dasa was a wealthy merchant of gold, silver and other miscellaneous jewellery from [[Karnataka]], who gave away all his material riches to become a Haridasa (literally meaning a servant of Lord Hari or Lord Krishna), a devotional singer who made the difficult Sanskrit tenets of [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] available to everyone in simple and melodious songs. Thus the pure and transcendental [[Madhwa]] philosophy of harisarvottamattva (means the supreme one is Lord Hari or Vishnu and all others jivas or living beings are his servants) not only remained among the scholars but also reached even common man for his spiritual upliftment.

He also composed ''Gitas'' (simple songs) for novice students.\n\nPurandara Dasa is noted for composing ''Dasa Sahithya'', as a [[Bhakti movement]] vocalist, and a music scholar. His practice was emulated by his younger contemporary, [[Kanakadasa]]. Purandara Dasa's Carnatic music compositions are mostly in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], though some are in [[Sanskrit]]. He signed his compositions with the ''ankita'' (pen name) \"Purandara Vittala\" ([[Vittala]] is another name of the supreme one, Lord [[Krishna]], one of the incarnations of the Lord [[Vishnu]]) and this same form of Lord [[Krishna]] is his aaradhya daiva or ishta murthi or worshippable deity. His work was appreciated by many scholars of his time and the later scholars.

At the age of 16 he was married to one Saraswati Bai, held by tradition to have been a pious young girl. He lost his parents at age 20, thereby inheriting his father's business of gemstones and pawning. He prospered and became known as ''Navakoti Narayana''(an abundantly rich man; worth ninety millions).\n\nPopular legend narrates a miraculous incident in Srinivasa Nayaka's life, owing to which he was led to devote himself to the practice, propagation and inculcation of ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) towards Lord Krishna through musical compositions.

The shrewd Srinavasa, privy to his wife's openhandedness, immediately identified the nose ring as his wife's and hurried home; enraged and anxious to ascertain the truth of the matter, he demanded his wife to produce the nose ring before him immediately. \n\nRealizing that Srinivasa had grown wise to her secret donation, the wife decided to end her life with poison. Having completed her prayers to the Lord before her attempt, she was shocked to see a nose ring inside the poison cup \u2013 completely identical to the one she had just given away. Incredulous and rapturous, she recounted the entire episode to her husband, who was bewildered and lost. Meanwhile, a search for the 'poor man' was of no avail; he had as mysteriously vanished as he had appeared! At that very propitious moment, Srinivasa's old self \u2013 convinced of the inscrutable ways of the Lord, having witnessed the unfailing grace that saved his pious wife, bewildered at the power that could, in a moment, produce a gold ornament by mere will \u2013 instantly shook off that beginningless, persistent veil in the form of 'I' and 'mine', which masks the men's vision of the divine. At 30 years of age, he gave away all his wealth in charity, and together with his family, abandoned his house to lead the life of a mendicant \u2013 living on alms and singing the glories of the Lord. In his very first song composition, he laments his wasted life of indulgence. It begins with the words \"Ana lae kara\" in the [[Shuddha Saveri]] [[raga]], set to Triputa [[Tala (music)|tala]].\n\nIn the course of his wandering he met the holy sage [[Vyasatirtha]], one of the chief exponents of Madhwa philosophy and the ''rajaguru'' of Krishnadevaraya, the emperor of Vijayanagara kingdom. According to Prof. Sambamoorthy,<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/10/20/stories/2006102000060300.htm Friday Review Chennai and Tamil Nadu. Columns : An authority on Purandara Dasa]. ''The Hindu''. 20 October 2006. \n</ref> Srinivasa had his formal initiation at the hands of Vyasatirtha in 1525 when he was about 40 years old, with the name Purandara Dasa bestowed on him.  Purandara Dasa traveled extensively through the length and breadth of the [[Vijayanagara]] empire in Karnataka, Tirupati, Pandharapura composing and rendering soul stirring songs in praise of god. He spent his last years in Hampi and also sang in Krishnadevaraya's durbar. The mantapa (mandap) in which he stayed is known as Purandara Dasa Mantapa (mandap) in Hampi. He died on 2 January 1565 at the age of 80. Within a short period after his death, [[Vijayanagara]] empire collapsed. Tradition and legend holds that he composed {{formatnum:475000}} keerthanas (songs). Further, according to this legend, his original desire was to compose 500,000 keerthanas. Being unable to do it in his present life, he requested his younger son to complete them. His son Madhwapathi told his father that he could do this in his next janma (birth). It is believed that he was reborn as the famous [[Vijaya Dasa|Vijayadaasa]]\u2014birthplace is Cheekalparvi village near Maanvi town, Raichur district in Karnataka State\u2014and completed the remaining 25 thousand keerthanas as promised. Most his songs are in praise of Lord Narayana and other Devatas.  Due to this, he is believed to be an avatar of Narada, the celestial singer and son of Goddess Saraswati. One of the ''trimurtis'' (three icons) of Carnatic music, Saint [[Thyagaraja]], has paid tribute to Purandara Dasa in his ''geya natakam''(an opera) Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam.<ref>[http://thyagaraja-vaibhavam.blogspot.in/2011/07/prahlada-bhakti-vijayam-part-1-dance.html Thyagaraja Vaibhavam: Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Dance-Drama].

He introduced the [[raga]] ''[[Mayamalavagowla]]'' as the basic scale for music instruction and fashioned a series of graded lessons such as ''swaravalis'', ''janti swaras'', ''alankaras'', ''lakshana geetas'', ''prabandhas'', ''ugabhogas'', ''daatu varase'', ''geeta'', ''sooladis'' and ''[[kriti]]s''.<ref name=\"iyer\"/> Another of his important contributions{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} was the fusion of ''bhava'', ''raga'', and ''laya'' in his compositions. He included comments on ordinary daily life and elements of colloquial language in his lyrics. He introduced folk ragas into the mainstream, setting his lyrics to tunes/ragas of his day so that even a common man could learn and sing them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/12/02/stories/0902070b.htm |title=Purandaradasa: Fountainhead of Karnataka sangeeta i.e., Carnatic music |access-date=10 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420185130/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/12/02/stories/0902070b.htm |archive-date=20 April 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> He also composed a large number of ''lakshya'' and ''lakshana'' ''geetas'', many of which are sung to this day.

Singer Madras Lalithangi, and her illustrious daughter Padmavibushan, Sangeetha Kalanidhi [[M. L. Vasanthakumari]] have rendered yeoman service in propagating the compositions of Purandara Dasa; both were considered as authorities on Purandara Dasa. M. L. Vasantha Kumari was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Mysore University]] for her contributions to Purandara Dasa's music.\n\nThough the compositions of Purandara Dasa are originally in the ''ragas'' of the Carnatic system of music, his compositions have been adopted and made equally popular in [[Hindustani music]].

Of late, Mysore Ramachandracharya is industriously propagating dasa sahitya through his concerts. [[Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams]] is also propagating the dasa krithis through the Dasa Sahitya Project.

It teaches complete self-surrender and unadulterated love towards Lord Krishna, the Supreme. The philosophy of Bhakti in Purandara Dasa's compositions stems from the essential teachings of the realistic-pluralistic Madhwa Philosophy of [[Vaishnavism]], and has been rendered in simple Kannada. The individual soul (''jeeva'') is a ''pratibimba'' (reflection) of the Lord (''Vishnu/Ishvara''), who is the ''bimba'' (source). The ''jeeva'' owes its existence, knowledge and bliss to the ''Ishvara'', and any sense of independence with regards to one's actions and the results thereof is to be given up.<ref>[http://madhwabrahmanas.blogspot.in/2010/09/essence-of-madhva-philosophy.html Tattvavaada Philosophy: The Essence of Madhva Philosophy].

The usage of the word untouchable is not used in the limited context of physical contact with the person, it is the worthlessness of the association with that person which is highlighted here. This is evident by the subsequent expressions in the song which says that one who does not practice self-discipline is untouchable, one who plots against his own government is untouchable, similarly one who shirks charity while having wealth is untouchable, one who poisons to eliminate his opponents is untouchable, one who does not use soft language is untouchable, one who prides over his purity of caste is untouchable and finally one who does not meditate on Purandara Vittala is untouchable.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Dasa's message is loud and clear rejecting untouchability in our society.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> He uses the name of Purandara Vittala to imply any God.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> This is evident from his other songs on various Gods and Goddesses.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Similar ideas were expressed by many other poets also.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/>\n\n== Example poem: Good \u2013 he became an ascetic-Hari Dasa ==\nPurandaradasa says how his wife made him Hari devotee and renounce all his crores of wealth and became an ascetic.\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|kn|'''\u0c86\u0ca6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2 \u0c92\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc6 \u0c86\u0caf\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc1'''\n\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97 : Poorvikalyani ; \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3 : \u0c86\u0ca6\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3}}\n\n{{lang|kn-Latn|Aadaddella oLitE aayitu namma\nShreedhara seve maadalu sadhana sampattayitu;\nDandige betta hidiyodakke\nmande maachi naachutalidde,\nHendati santati saavirvaagali\nDandige betta hidisidaLyya\nGopaaLa butti hidiyodakke.\nBhupatiyante garvisutidde,\nAa patnee kula saavirvaagali,\nGopaaLa butti hidisidaLayya;\nTuLasi male haakuvudakke\nArasanante naachutalidde,\nSarasijaksha Purandhara ViTTala\nTuLasi male haakisidnayya!}}\n|attr1=from Dasara Padagalu collection by G.

He received a good education in accordance with the family traditions and acquired proficiency in Kannada, Sanskrit, and sacred music.  At the age of 16 he was married to one Saraswati Bai, held by tradition to have been a pious young girl. He lost his parents at age 20, thereby inheriting his father's business of gemstones and pawning. He prospered and became known as ''Navakoti Narayana''(an abundantly rich man; worth ninety millions).\n\nPopular legend narrates a miraculous incident in Srinivasa Nayaka's life, owing to which he was led to devote himself to the practice, propagation and inculcation of ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) towards Lord Krishna through musical compositions. As a natural, inescapable consequence of such a transforming event, ubiquitous in the lives of several saints throughout the ages, he is believed to have relinquished his former greedy and miserly self, having realized the worthlessness of attachment to worldly possessions:<ref>Iyengar, Masti Venkatesha (\"Srinavasa\"). 1964. [http://ellakavi.wordpress.com/2007/07/28/masti-venkatesha-iyengara-story ''Purandara Daasa'']. Bangalore: Bangalore Press.</ref> The Lord, in a bid to cure Srinivasa of his tenacious materialistic delusion and attachment, and thereby claim his devotion to Himself, approached Srinivasa in the guise of a poor man, with a piteous plea for money; ostensibly, the money was direly needed to perform His (!) son's ''upanayana'' (sacred initiation). \n\nHaving been summarily rejected, mocked and turned out, the 'poor man' surreptitiously repeated his plea before Srinivasa's wife; a generous soul of rigorous spiritual nature, she gave away one of her precious nose rings, unbeknownst to her husband; the 'poor man' sold the nose ring back to none other than Srinivasa himself! The shrewd Srinavasa, privy to his wife's openhandedness, immediately identified the nose ring as his wife's and hurried home; enraged and anxious to ascertain the truth of the matter, he demanded his wife to produce the nose ring before him immediately. \n\nRealizing that Srinivasa had grown wise to her secret donation, the wife decided to end her life with poison. Having completed her prayers to the Lord before her attempt, she was shocked to see a nose ring inside the poison cup \u2013 completely identical to the one she had just given away. Incredulous and rapturous, she recounted the entire episode to her husband, who was bewildered and lost. Meanwhile, a search for the 'poor man' was of no avail; he had as mysteriously vanished as he had appeared! At that very propitious moment, Srinivasa's old self \u2013 convinced of the inscrutable ways of the Lord, having witnessed the unfailing grace that saved his pious wife, bewildered at the power that could, in a moment, produce a gold ornament by mere will \u2013 instantly shook off that beginningless, persistent veil in the form of 'I' and 'mine', which masks the men's vision of the divine. At 30 years of age, he gave away all his wealth in charity, and together with his family, abandoned his house to lead the life of a mendicant \u2013 living on alms and singing the glories of the Lord. In his very first song composition, he laments his wasted life of indulgence. It begins with the words \"Ana lae kara\" in the [[Shuddha Saveri]] [[raga]], set to Triputa [[Tala (music)|tala]].\n\nIn the course of his wandering he met the holy sage [[Vyasatirtha]], one of the chief exponents of Madhwa philosophy and the ''rajaguru'' of Krishnadevaraya, the emperor of Vijayanagara kingdom. According to Prof. Sambamoorthy,<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2006/10/20/stories/2006102000060300.htm Friday Review Chennai and Tamil Nadu. Columns : An authority on Purandara Dasa]. ''The Hindu''. 20 October 2006. \n</ref> Srinivasa had his formal initiation at the hands of Vyasatirtha in 1525 when he was about 40 years old, with the name Purandara Dasa bestowed on him.  Purandara Dasa traveled extensively through the length and breadth of the [[Vijayanagara]] empire in Karnataka, Tirupati, Pandharapura composing and rendering soul stirring songs in praise of god. He spent his last years in Hampi and also sang in Krishnadevaraya's durbar. The mantapa (mandap) in which he stayed is known as Purandara Dasa Mantapa (mandap) in Hampi. He died on 2 January 1565 at the age of 80. Within a short period after his death, [[Vijayanagara]] empire collapsed. Tradition and legend holds that he composed {{formatnum:475000}} keerthanas (songs). Further, according to this legend, his original desire was to compose 500,000 keerthanas. Being unable to do it in his present life, he requested his younger son to complete them. His son Madhwapathi told his father that he could do this in his next janma (birth). It is believed that he was reborn as the famous [[Vijaya Dasa|Vijayadaasa]]\u2014birthplace is Cheekalparvi village near Maanvi town, Raichur district in Karnataka State\u2014and completed the remaining 25 thousand keerthanas as promised. Most his songs are in praise of Lord Narayana and other Devatas.  Due to this, he is believed to be an avatar of Narada, the celestial singer and son of Goddess Saraswati. One of the ''trimurtis'' (three icons) of Carnatic music, Saint [[Thyagaraja]], has paid tribute to Purandara Dasa in his ''geya natakam''(an opera) Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam.<ref>[http://thyagaraja-vaibhavam.blogspot.in/2011/07/prahlada-bhakti-vijayam-part-1-dance.html Thyagaraja Vaibhavam: Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Dance-Drama].

The usage of the word untouchable is not used in the limited context of physical contact with the person, it is the worthlessness of the association with that person which is highlighted here. This is evident by the subsequent expressions in the song which says that one who does not practice self-discipline is untouchable, one who plots against his own government is untouchable, similarly one who shirks charity while having wealth is untouchable, one who poisons to eliminate his opponents is untouchable, one who does not use soft language is untouchable, one who prides over his purity of caste is untouchable and finally one who does not meditate on Purandara Vittala is untouchable.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Dasa's message is loud and clear rejecting untouchability in our society.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> He uses the name of Purandara Vittala to imply any God.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> This is evident from his other songs on various Gods and Goddesses.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/> Similar ideas were expressed by many other poets also.<ref name=\"Lyrical\"/>\n\n== Example poem: Good \u2013 he became an ascetic-Hari Dasa ==\nPurandaradasa says how his wife made him Hari devotee and renounce all his crores of wealth and became an ascetic.\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|kn|'''\u0c86\u0ca6\u0ca6\u0ccd\u0ca6\u0cc6\u0cb2\u0ccd\u0cb2 \u0c92\u0cb3\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc6 \u0c86\u0caf\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cc1'''\n\u0cb0\u0cbe\u0c97 : Poorvikalyani ; \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3 : \u0c86\u0ca6\u0cbf\u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3}}\n\n{{lang|kn-Latn|Aadaddella oLitE aayitu namma\nShreedhara seve maadalu sadhana sampattayitu;\nDandige betta hidiyodakke\nmande maachi naachutalidde,\nHendati santati saavirvaagali\nDandige betta hidisidaLyya\nGopaaLa butti hidiyodakke.\nBhupatiyante garvisutidde,\nAa patnee kula saavirvaagali,\nGopaaLa butti hidisidaLayya;\nTuLasi male haakuvudakke\nArasanante naachutalidde,\nSarasijaksha Purandhara ViTTala\nTuLasi male haakisidnayya!}}\n|attr1=from Dasara Padagalu collection by G.

{"title_page": "Data erasure", "text_new": "'''Data erasure''' (sometimes referred to as '''data clearing''', '''data wiping''', or '''data destruction''') is a software-based method of [[overwriting]] the data that aims to completely destroy all [[Data remanence|electronic data residing]] on a [[hard disk drive]] or other [[digital media]] by using zeros and ones to overwrite data onto all sectors of the device. By overwriting the data on the storage device, the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization.\n\nIdeally, software designed for data erasure should:\n \n#Allow for selection of a specific standard, based on unique needs, and \n#Verify the overwriting method has been successful and removed data across the entire device.\n\nPermanent data erasure goes beyond basic [[file deletion]] commands, which only remove direct pointers to the data [[disk sector]]s and make the [[data recovery]] possible with common software tools. Unlike [[degaussing]] and physical destruction, which render the storage media unusable, data erasure removes all information while leaving the disk operable. New [[flash memory]]-based media implementations, such as [[solid-state drive]]s or [[USB flash drive]]s, can cause data erasure techniques to fail allowing [[remnant data]] to be recoverable.<ref name=\"m.wei\">{{cite web |title=Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf |work=FAST '11: 9th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies |accessdate=31 October 2013 |author1=Michael Wei |author2=Laura M. Grupp |author3=Frederick E. Spada |author4=Steven Swanson |format=PDF |quote=For sanitizing entire disks, built-in sanitize commands are effective when implemented correctly, and software techniques work most, but not all, of the time. We found that none of the available software techniques for sanitizing individual files were effective.}}</ref>\n\nSoftware-based overwriting uses a software application to write a stream of zeros, ones or meaningless pseudorandom data onto all sectors of a hard disk drive. There are key differentiators between data erasure and other overwriting methods, which can leave data intact and raise the risk of [[data breach]], [[identity theft]] or failure to achieve regulatory compliance. Many data eradication programs also provide [[#Number of overwrites needed|multiple overwrites]] so that they support recognized government and industry standards, though a single-pass overwrite is widely considered to be sufficient for modern hard disk drives. Good software should provide verification of data removal, which is necessary for meeting certain standards.\n\nTo protect the data on lost or stolen media, some data erasure applications remotely destroy the data if the password is incorrectly entered. Data erasure tools can also target specific data on a disk for routine erasure, providing a [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] protection method that is less time-consuming than software encryption. [[Electronic hardware|Hardware]]/[[firmware]] encryption built into the drive itself or integrated controllers is a popular solution with no degradation in performance at all.\n\n==Encryption==\nWhen encryption is in place, data erasure acts as a complement to [[crypto-shredding]], or the practice of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys. \nPresently, dedicated hardware/firmware encryption solutions can perform a 256-bit full [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES encryption]] faster than the drive electronics can write the data. Drives with this capability are known as self-encrypting drives ([[Hardware-based full disk encryption|SEDs]]); they are present on most modern enterprise-level laptops and are increasingly used in the enterprise to protect the data. Changing the encryption key renders inaccessible all data stored on a SED, which is an easy and very fast method for achieving a 100% data erasure. Theft of an SED results in a physical asset loss, but the stored data is inaccessible without the decryption key that is not stored on a SED, assuming there are no effective attacks against AES or its implementation in the drive hardware.\n\n==Importance==\nInformation technology assets commonly hold large volumes of confidential data. [[Social security number]]s, credit card numbers, bank details, medical history and classified information are often stored on computer hard drives or [[Server (computing)|servers]]. These can inadvertently or intentionally make their way onto other media such as printers, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[Flash memory|flash]], [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz]], and [[Iomega REV|REV]] drives.\n\n===Data breach===\nIncreased storage of sensitive data, combined with rapid technological change and the shorter lifespan of IT assets, has driven the need for permanent data erasure of electronic devices as they are retired or refurbished. Also, compromised networks and [[laptop theft]] and loss, as well as that of other portable media, are increasingly common sources of data breaches.\n\nIf data erasure does not occur when a disk is retired or lost, an organization or user faces a possibility that the data will be stolen and compromised, leading to identity theft, loss of corporate reputation, threats to regulatory compliance and financial impacts. Companies spend large amounts of money to make sure their data is erased when they discard disks.<ref name=breach>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|title=Average data breach costs companies $5 million|author=Fontana, John|work=[[Network World]]|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2010-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808113930/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|archive-date=8 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{dubious|The reference talks links to http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/102506-data-breach-costs-rise-year.html as a source, but that doesn't support the claim at all|date=January 2012}} High-profile incidents of data theft include:<!-- date order -->\n* CardSystems Solutions (2005-06-19): Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts.<ref>{{cite news|author=Evers, Joris |date=2005-06-19|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/credit-card-breach-exposes-40-million-accounts-139197997.htm |title=Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts |agency=[[CNET News]]|publisher=[[ZDNET]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref><!-- was dead link, correct title made recovery easy-->\n* Lifeblood (2008-02-13):  Missing laptops contain personal information including dates of birth and some Social Security numbers of 321,000.<ref>{{cite web| author=Powers, Mary |date=2008-02-13|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/13/missing-lifeblood-laptops-personal-information-tho/ |title=Laptops missing with IDs of donors|work=[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Hannaford (2008-03-17): Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.<ref>{{cite news| author=Sharp, David |date=2008-03-17|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23678909 |title=Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.|agency= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=NBC News|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Compass Bank (2008-03-21): Stolen hard drive contains 1,000,000 customer records.<ref>Vijayan, Jaikumar (2008-03-21).

[[Disk encryption software|Disk encryption]] before use prevents this problem. Software-driven data erasure could also be compromised by malicious code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/government/MDG/NSA_CSS_Storage_Device_Declassification_Manual.pdf|format=PDF|title=NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual|publisher=[[NSA]]|access-date=19 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320074045/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/government/MDG/NSA_CSS_Storage_Device_Declassification_Manual.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}} This Manual 912 supersedes NSA/CSS Manual 1302, dated 10 November 2000.</ref>\n\n==Differentiators==\nSoftware-based data erasure uses a disk accessible application to write a combination of ones, zeroes and any other [[Alphanumeric character generator|alpha numeric character]] also known as the \"mask\" onto each hard disk drive sector. The level of [[security]] when using software data destruction tools are increased dramatically by pre-testing hard drives for sector abnormalities and ensuring that the drive is 100% in working order. The number of wipes has become obsolete with the more recent inclusion of a \"verify pass\" which scans all sectors of the disk and checks against what character should be there i.e.; 1 Pass of AA has to fill every writable sector of the hard disk. This makes any more than 1 Pass an unnecessary and certainly a more damaging act especially as drives have passed the 1TB mark.\n\n===Full disk overwriting===\nWhile there are many overwriting programs, only those capable of complete data erasure offer full security by destroying the data on all areas of a hard drive. Disk overwriting programs that cannot access the entire hard drive, including hidden/locked areas like the [[host protected area]] (HPA), [[device configuration overlay]] (DCO), and remapped sectors, perform an incomplete erasure, leaving some of the data intact. By accessing the entire hard drive, data erasure eliminates the risk of [[data remanence]].\n\nData erasure can also bypass the [[operating system|Operating System (OS)]]. Overwriting programs that operate through the OS will not always perform a complete erasure because they cannot modify the contents of the hard drive that are actively in use by that OS. Because of this, many data erasure programs like [[Darik's Boot and Nuke|DBAN]] are provided in a bootable format, where you run off of a [[live CD]] that has all of the necessary software to erase the disk.\n\n===Hardware support===\nData erasure can be deployed over a network to target multiple [[Personal computer|PCs]] rather than having to erase each one sequentially. In contrast with [[DOS]]-based overwriting programs that may not detect all network hardware, [[Linux]]-based data erasure software supports high-end server and [[storage area network]] (SAN) environments with hardware support for [[Serial ATA]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS) and [[Fibre Channel]] disks and remapped sectors. It operates directly with sector sizes such as 520, 524, and 528, removing the need to first reformat back to 512 sector size. [[WinPE]] has now overtaken Linux as the environment of choice since drivers can be added with little effort. This also helps with data destruction of tablets and other handheld devices that require pure UEFI environments without hardware NIC's installed and/or are lacking UEFI network stack support.\n\n===Standards===\nMany government and industry standards exist for software-based overwriting that removes the data. A key factor in meeting these standards is the number of times the data is overwritten. Also, some standards require a method to verify that all the data have been removed from the entire hard drive and to view the overwrite pattern. Complete data erasure should account for hidden areas, typically DCO, HPA and remapped sectors.\n\nThe 1995 edition of the [[National Industrial Security Program]] Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) permitted the use of overwriting techniques to sanitize some types of media by writing all addressable locations with a character, its complement, and then a random character. This provision was removed in a 2001 change to the manual and was never permitted for Top Secret media, but it is still listed as a technique by many providers of the data erasure software.<ref name=\"22-M\"/>\n\nData erasure software should provide the user with a [[Verification and validation|validation]] certificate indicating that the overwriting procedure was completed properly. Data erasure software should{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also comply with requirements to erase hidden areas, provide a defects log list and list bad sectors that could not be overwritten.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By overwriting the data on the storage device, the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization.\n\nIdeally, software designed for data erasure should:\n \n#Allow for selection of a specific standard, based on unique needs, and \n#Verify the overwriting method has been successful and removed data across the entire device.\n\nPermanent data erasure goes beyond basic [[file deletion]] commands, which only remove direct pointers to the data [[disk sector]]s and make the [[data recovery]] possible with common software tools. Unlike [[degaussing]] and physical destruction, which render the storage media unusable, data erasure removes all information while leaving the disk operable. New [[flash memory]]-based media implementations, such as [[solid-state drive]]s or [[USB flash drive]]s, can cause data erasure techniques to fail allowing [[remnant data]] to be recoverable.<ref name=\"m.wei\">{{cite web |title=Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives |url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf |work=FAST '11: 9th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies |accessdate=31 October 2013 |author1=Michael Wei |author2=Laura M.

We found that none of the available software techniques for sanitizing individual files were effective.}}</ref>\n\nSoftware-based overwriting uses a software application to write a stream of zeros, ones or meaningless pseudorandom data onto all sectors of a hard disk drive. There are key differentiators between data erasure and other overwriting methods, which can leave data intact and raise the risk of [[data breach]], [[identity theft]] or failure to achieve regulatory compliance. Many data eradication programs also provide [[#Number of overwrites needed|multiple overwrites]] so that they support recognized government and industry standards, though a single-pass overwrite is widely considered to be sufficient for modern hard disk drives. Good software should provide verification of data removal, which is necessary for meeting certain standards.\n\nTo protect the data on lost or stolen media, some data erasure applications remotely destroy the data if the password is incorrectly entered. Data erasure tools can also target specific data on a disk for routine erasure, providing a [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] protection method that is less time-consuming than software encryption. [[Electronic hardware|Hardware]]/[[firmware]] encryption built into the drive itself or integrated controllers is a popular solution with no degradation in performance at all.\n\n==Encryption==\nWhen encryption is in place, data erasure acts as a complement to [[crypto-shredding]], or the practice of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys. \nPresently, dedicated hardware/firmware encryption solutions can perform a 256-bit full [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES encryption]] faster than the drive electronics can write the data. Drives with this capability are known as self-encrypting drives ([[Hardware-based full disk encryption|SEDs]]); they are present on most modern enterprise-level laptops and are increasingly used in the enterprise to protect the data. Changing the encryption key renders inaccessible all data stored on a SED, which is an easy and very fast method for achieving a 100% data erasure. Theft of an SED results in a physical asset loss, but the stored data is inaccessible without the decryption key that is not stored on a SED, assuming there are no effective attacks against AES or its implementation in the drive hardware.\n\n==Importance==\nInformation technology assets commonly hold large volumes of confidential data. [[Social security number]]s, credit card numbers, bank details, medical history and classified information are often stored on computer hard drives or [[Server (computing)|servers]]. These can inadvertently or intentionally make their way onto other media such as printers, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[Flash memory|flash]], [[Iomega Zip drive|Zip]], [[Iomega Jaz drive|Jaz]], and [[Iomega REV|REV]] drives.\n\n===Data breach===\nIncreased storage of sensitive data, combined with rapid technological change and the shorter lifespan of IT assets, has driven the need for permanent data erasure of electronic devices as they are retired or refurbished. Also, compromised networks and [[laptop theft]] and loss, as well as that of other portable media, are increasingly common sources of data breaches.\n\nIf data erasure does not occur when a disk is retired or lost, an organization or user faces a possibility that the data will be stolen and compromised, leading to identity theft, loss of corporate reputation, threats to regulatory compliance and financial impacts. Companies spend large amounts of money to make sure their data is erased when they discard disks.<ref name=breach>{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|title=Average data breach costs companies $5 million|author=Fontana, John|work=[[Network World]]|date=2006-11-02|accessdate=2010-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808113930/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110206-data-breach-cost.html|archive-date=8 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{dubious|The reference talks links to http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/102506-data-breach-costs-rise-year.html as a source, but that doesn't support the claim at all|date=January 2012}} High-profile incidents of data theft include:<!-- date order -->\n* CardSystems Solutions (2005-06-19): Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts.<ref>{{cite news|author=Evers, Joris |date=2005-06-19|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/credit-card-breach-exposes-40-million-accounts-139197997.htm |title=Credit card breach exposes 40 million accounts |agency=[[CNET News]]|publisher=[[ZDNET]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref><!-- was dead link, correct title made recovery easy-->\n* Lifeblood (2008-02-13):  Missing laptops contain personal information including dates of birth and some Social Security numbers of 321,000.<ref>{{cite web| author=Powers, Mary |date=2008-02-13|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/13/missing-lifeblood-laptops-personal-information-tho/ |title=Laptops missing with IDs of donors|work=[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Hannaford (2008-03-17): Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.<ref>{{cite news| author=Sharp, David |date=2008-03-17|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23678909 |title=Breach exposes 4.2 million credit, debit cards.|agency= [[Associated Press]] |publisher=NBC News|accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref>\n* Compass Bank (2008-03-21): Stolen hard drive contains 1,000,000 customer records.<ref>Vijayan, Jaikumar (2008-03-21).

The number of wipes has become obsolete with the more recent inclusion of a \"verify pass\" which scans all sectors of the disk and checks against what character should be there i.e.; 1 Pass of AA has to fill every writable sector of the hard disk. This makes any more than 1 Pass an unnecessary and certainly a more damaging act especially as drives have passed the 1TB mark.\n\n===Full disk overwriting===\nWhile there are many overwriting programs, only those capable of complete data erasure offer full security by destroying the data on all areas of a hard drive. Disk overwriting programs that cannot access the entire hard drive, including hidden/locked areas like the [[host protected area]] (HPA), [[device configuration overlay]] (DCO), and remapped sectors, perform an incomplete erasure, leaving some of the data intact. By accessing the entire hard drive, data erasure eliminates the risk of [[data remanence]].\n\nData erasure can also bypass the [[operating system|Operating System (OS)]]. Overwriting programs that operate through the OS will not always perform a complete erasure because they cannot modify the contents of the hard drive that are actively in use by that OS. Because of this, many data erasure programs like [[Darik's Boot and Nuke|DBAN]] are provided in a bootable format, where you run off of a [[live CD]] that has all of the necessary software to erase the disk.\n\n===Hardware support===\nData erasure can be deployed over a network to target multiple [[Personal computer|PCs]] rather than having to erase each one sequentially. In contrast with [[DOS]]-based overwriting programs that may not detect all network hardware, [[Linux]]-based data erasure software supports high-end server and [[storage area network]] (SAN) environments with hardware support for [[Serial ATA]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS) and [[Fibre Channel]] disks and remapped sectors. It operates directly with sector sizes such as 520, 524, and 528, removing the need to first reformat back to 512 sector size. [[WinPE]] has now overtaken Linux as the environment of choice since drivers can be added with little effort. This also helps with data destruction of tablets and other handheld devices that require pure UEFI environments without hardware NIC's installed and/or are lacking UEFI network stack support.\n\n===Standards===\nMany government and industry standards exist for software-based overwriting that removes the data. A key factor in meeting these standards is the number of times the data is overwritten. Also, some standards require a method to verify that all the data have been removed from the entire hard drive and to view the overwrite pattern. Complete data erasure should account for hidden areas, typically DCO, HPA and remapped sectors.\n\nThe 1995 edition of the [[National Industrial Security Program]] Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) permitted the use of overwriting techniques to sanitize some types of media by writing all addressable locations with a character, its complement, and then a random character. This provision was removed in a 2001 change to the manual and was never permitted for Top Secret media, but it is still listed as a technique by many providers of the data erasure software.<ref name=\"22-M\"/>\n\nData erasure software should provide the user with a [[Verification and validation|validation]] certificate indicating that the overwriting procedure was completed properly. Data erasure software should{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also comply with requirements to erase hidden areas, provide a defects log list and list bad sectors that could not be overwritten.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

S. Eliot]], who became a recurring intellectual foil. Bloom had a contentious approach: his first book, ''Shelley's Myth-making'', charged many contemporary critics with sheer carelessness in their reading of the poet.\n\n===Influence theory===\n\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|A lion-faced [[deity]] associated with [[Gnosticism]]. Bloom frequently referred to Gnosticism when speaking about general and personal religious matters.]]\n\nAfter a personal crisis during the late 1960s, Bloom became deeply interested in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the ancient mystic traditions of [[Gnosticism]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hermeticism]]. In a 2003 interview with Bloom, [[Michael Pakenham]], the book editor for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', posited that Bloom has long referred to himself as a \"Jewish Gnostic\". Bloom explained: \"I am using Gnostic in a very broad way. I am nothing if not Jewish... I really am a product of Yiddish culture. But I can't understand a [[Yahweh]], or a [[God]], who could be all-powerful and all knowing and would allow the [[Nazi death camps]] and [[schizophrenia]].\"<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = In Full Bloom: Guerrilla In Our Midst\n  |last = Pakenham\n  |first = Michael\n  |website = [[The Baltimore Sun]]\n  |date = March 23, 2003\n  |accessdate = September 15, 2016\n  |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-03-23/entertainment/0303240442_1_bloom-dining-room-table\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Influenced by his reading, he began a series of books that focused on the way in which poets struggled to create their own individual poetic visions without being overcome by the influence of the previous poets who inspired them to write.\n\nThe first of these books, ''Yeats'', a magisterial examination of [[William Butler Yeats|the poet]], challenged the conventional critical view of his poetic career. In the introduction to this volume, Bloom set out the basic principles of his new approach to criticism: \"Poetic influence, as I conceive it, is a variety of melancholy or the anxiety-principle.\" New poets become inspired to write because they have read and admired the poetry of previous poets; but this admiration turns into resentment when the new poets discover that these poets whom they idolized have already said everything they wish to say. The poets become disappointed because they \"cannot be [[Adam]] early in the morning. There have been too many Adams, and they have named everything.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn order to evade this psychological obstacle, according to Bloom, new poets must be convinced that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving open the possibility that they may have something to add to the tradition after all. The new poets' love for their heroes turns into antagonism towards them: \"Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible.\"<ref>''Map of Misreading'', p. 10.</ref> The book that followed ''Yeats'', ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]'', which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of [[Walter Jackson Bate]]'s ''The Burden of the Past and The English Poet'' and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by 17th and 18th-century poets about their ability to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which poets broke free from their precursors to achieve their own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between \"strong poets\" who perform \"strong misreadings\" of their precursors, and \"weak poets\" who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of \"revisionary ratios\", through which each strong poet passes in the course of their career.\n\n====Addenda and developments of his theory====\n''A Map of Misreading'' picked up where ''The Anxiety of Influence'' left off, making several adjustments to Bloom's system of revisionary ratios. ''Kabbalah and Criticism'' attempted to invoke the esoteric interpretive system of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], as explicated by scholar [[Gershom Scholem]], as an alternate system of mapping the path of poetic influence. ''Figures of Capable Imagination'' collected odd pieces Bloom had written in the process of composing his \"influence\" books.\n\nBloom continued to write about influence theory throughout the 1970s and '80s, and penned little thereafter that did not invoke his ideas about influence.\n\n===Novel experiment===\nBloom's fascination with the fantasy novel ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]] led him to take a brief break from criticism in order to compose a sequel to Lindsay's novel. This novel, ''[[The Flight to Lucifer]]'', was Bloom's only work of fiction.<ref name=\"The Violet Apple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.violetapple.org.uk/notes/bloom_flighttolucifer.php|title=The Flight to Lucifer review|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Religious criticism===\nBloom then entered a phase of what he called \"religious criticism\", beginning with ''Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present'' (1989).\n\nIn ''The Book of J'' (1990), he and [[David Rosenberg (poet)|David Rosenberg]] (who translated the Biblical texts) portrayed one of the posited ancient documents that formed the basis of the first five books of the Bible (see [[documentary hypothesis]]) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a [[dogmatic]]ally religious work (see [[Jahwist]]). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings [[David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]]\u2014a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations did not go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical [[Bathsheba]].<ref>Bloom, Harold, ''The Western Canon. The Books and Schools of the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1994, p. 5.</ref> In ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in ''The Book of J'' in discussing the significance of [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of [[Christianity and Judaism]].\n\nIn ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), Bloom surveyed the major varieties of [[Protestant]] and post-Protestant religious faiths that originated in the United States and argued that, in terms of their psychological hold on their adherents, most shared more in common with [[gnosticism]] than with historical Christianity. The exception was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whom Bloom regards as non-Gnostic. He elsewhere predicted that the [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] strains of [[American Christianity]] would overtake mainstream Protestant divisions in popularity in the next few decades. In ''Omens of Millennium'' (1996), Bloom identifies these American religious elements as on the periphery of an old \u2013 and not inherently Christian \u2013 gnostic, religious tradition which invokes a complex of ideas and experiences concerning [[angelology]], interpretation of dreams as [[prophecy]], [[near-death experience]]s, and [[millennialism]].<ref>Bloom (1996), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn his essay in ''The Gospel of Thomas'', Bloom states that none of Thomas' [[Aramaic]] sayings have survived in the original language.<ref>Bloom, Harold. \"A Reading\", in ''The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus''. English translation and critical edition of the Coptic text by Marvin W. Meyer. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992, pp. 115 and 119.</ref> [[Marvin Meyer]] generally agreed and further confirmed that the earlier versions of that text were likely written in either Aramaic or Greek.<ref>Mayer, Marvin. \"Introduction\". The Gospel of Thomas. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992, p. 9.</ref> Meyer ends his introduction with an endorsement of much of Bloom's essay.<ref>Meyer (1992), p. 19.</ref> Bloom notes the other-worldliness of the Jesus in the Thomas sayings by making reference to \"the paradox also of the American Jesus.\"<ref>Meyer (1992), p. 119.</ref>\n\n===''The Western Canon''===\n''[[The Western Canon]]'' (1994), a survey of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focuses on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations<ref>Bloom (1994), p. 2.</ref> and of the [[Western canon]].<ref>Bloom (1994), p. 11.</ref> Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, Bloom's major concern in the volume was reclaiming literature from those he referred to as the \"[[School of Resentment]]\", the mostly academic critics who espoused a social purpose in reading. Bloom asserted that the goals of reading must be solitary [[aesthetic]] pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal of improving one's society held by \"forces of resentment\". He cast the latter as an absurd aim, writing: \"The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading [[Shakespeare]] is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools.\" His position was that politics had no place in literary criticism, that a [[feminist]] or [[Marxist]] reading of ''[[Hamlet]]'' would tell us something about feminism and Marxism but probably nothing about ''Hamlet'' itself.\n\nIn addition to considering how much influence a writer had had on later writers, Bloom proposed the concept of \"canonical strangeness\" (cf. [[uncanny]]) as a benchmark of a literary work's merit. ''The Western Canon'' also included a list\u2014which aroused more widespread interest than anything else in the volume\u2014of all the Western works from antiquity to the present that Bloom considered either permanent members of the canon of literary classics, or (among more recent works) candidates for that status. Bloom said that he made the list off the top of his head at his editor's request, and that he did not stand by it.<ref name=vice />\n\n===Work on Shakespeare===\n[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]] (1564\u20131616)]]\n\nBloom had a deep appreciation for [[William Shakespeare]]<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;2\u20133.</ref> and considered him to be the supreme center of the Western canon.<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;24\u20135.</ref> The first edition of ''The Anxiety of Influence'' almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom then considered barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, added a long preface that mostly expounded Shakespeare's debt to [[Ovid]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], and his [[agon#Literature|agon]] with contemporary [[Christopher Marlowe]], who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.\n\nIn his later survey, ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (1998), Bloom provided an analysis of each of Shakespeare's 38 plays, \"twenty-four of which are masterpieces.\" Written as a companion to the general reader and theater-goer, Bloom declared that [[bardolatry]] \"ought to be even more a secular religion than it already is.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''. New York: Riverhead, 1998, p. xix.</ref> He also contended in the work (as in the title) that Shakespeare \"invented\" humanity, in that he prescribed the now-common practice of \"overhearing\" ourselves, which drives our changes. The two paragons of his theory were [[Sir John Falstaff]] of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], whom Bloom saw as representing self-satisfaction and self-loathing, respectively. Throughout ''Shakespeare'', characters from disparate plays were imagined alongside and interacting with each other. This has been decried by numerous contemporary academics and critics as harking back to the out of fashion character criticism of [[A. C. Bradley]] (and others), who gathered explicit praise in the book. As in ''The Western Canon'', Bloom criticized what he called the \"School of Resentment\" for its failure to live up to the challenge of Shakespeare's universality and for [[Balkanization|balkanizing]] the study of literature through multicultural and [[New Historicism|historicist]] departments. Asserting Shakespeare's singular popularity throughout the world, Bloom proclaimed him the only truly multicultural author. Repudiating the \"social energies\" to which historicists ascribed Shakespeare's authorship, Bloom pronounced his modern academic foes \u2013 and indeed, all of society \u2013 to be but \"a parody of Shakespearian energies.\"\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nBloom consolidated his work on the western canon with the publication of ''How to Read and Why'' (2000) and ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' (2003). ''Hamlet: Poem Unlimited'' (also 2003) is an amendment to ''Shakespeare: Invention of the Human'' written after he decided the chapter on ''Hamlet'' in that earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself. Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in ''Where Shall Wisdom Be Found'' (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2005). Throughout the decade he also compiled, edited and introduced several major anthologies of poetry.\n\nBloom took part in the documentary, the ''[[Apparition of the Eternal Church]]'' (2006), made by [[Paul Festa]]. This documentary centered on many individuals' reactions to hearing, for the first time, Olivier Messiaen's organ piece ''[[Apparition de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9ternelle]]''.\n\nBloom began a book under the working title of ''Living Labyrinth'', centering on Shakespeare and [[Walt Whitman]], which was published as ''The Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life'' (2011).\n\nIn July 2011, after the publication of ''The Anatomy of Influence'' and after finishing work on ''The Shadow of a Great Rock'', Bloom was working on three further projects:\n* ''Achievement in the Evening Land from Emerson to [[Faulkner]]'', a history of American literature following the canonical model, which ultimately developed into his book ''The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime'' (2015).\n* ''The Hum of Thoughts Evaded in the Mind: A Literary Memoir'', which ultimately developed into his book ''Possessed by Memory: The Inward Light of Criticism'' (2019).\n* a play with the working title ''Walt Whitman: A Musical Pageant''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioopensource.org/harold-bloom-on-the-playing-field-of-poetry/|title=Harold Bloom: On the Playing Field of Poetry - Open Source with Christopher Lydon|author=|date=July 5, 2011|website=www.radioopensource.org|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref> By November 2011, Bloom had changed the title of the play to ''To You Whoever You Are: A Pageant Celebrating Walt Whitman''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/will-this-election-be-the-mormon-breakthrough.html \"Will This Election Be the Mormon Breakthrough?\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|In ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'', Bloom claimed that [[Samuel Johnson]] was \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him.\"]]\n\nIn 1986, Bloom credited [[Northrop Frye]] as his nearest precursor. He told [[Imre Salusinszky]] in 1986: \"In terms of my own theorizations&nbsp;... the precursor proper has to be Northrop Frye. I purchased and read ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'' a week or two after it had come out and reached the bookstore in Ithaca, New York. It ravished my heart away. I have tried to find an alternative father in Mr. [[Kenneth Burke]], who is a charming fellow and a very powerful critic, but I don't come from Burke, I come out of Frye.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html#roots|title=Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Interviews|author=|date=|website=prelectur.stanford.edu|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in ''Anatomy of Influence'' (2011), he wrote \"I no longer have the patience to read anything by Frye\" and nominated Angus Fletcher of the City University of New York among his living contemporaries as his \"critical guide and conscience\" and elsewhere that year recommended Fletcher's ''Colors of the Mind'' and ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' by [[M. H. Abrams]]. In this late phase of his career, Bloom also emphasized the tradition of earlier critics such as [[William Hazlitt]], Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Walter Pater]], [[A. C. Bradley]], and [[Samuel Johnson]], describing Johnson in ''The Western Canon'' as \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him\". In his 2012 Foreword to the book ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012), Bloom indicated the influence which M. H. Abrams had upon him in his years at Cornell University.<ref>M. H. Abrams. ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012).</ref>\n\nBloom's theory of poetic influence regards the development of [[Western literature]] as a process of borrowing and misreading. Writers find their creative inspiration in previous writers and begin by imitating those writers in order to develop a poetic voice of their own; however, they must make their own work different from that of their precursors. As a result, Bloom argues, authors of real power must inevitably \"misread\" their precursors' works in order to make room for fresh imaginings.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2225/the-art-of-criticism-no-1-harold-bloom| title=Harold Bloom, The Art of Criticism No. 1| journal=Paris Review| volume=Spring 1991| issue=118| date=Spring 1991| author=Antonio Weiss}}</ref><ref>Paul Fry, [http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-14 \"Engl 300: Introduction To Theory Of Literature\"].

He told [[Robert Moynihan]] in 1983, \"What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through [[apophatic theology|negative theology]]&nbsp;...

After Murdoch died, Bloom expressed admiration for novelists such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], [[Will Self]], [[John Banville]], and [[A. S.

S. Eliot]], who became a recurring intellectual foil. Bloom had a contentious approach: his first book, ''Shelley's Myth-making'', charged many contemporary critics with sheer carelessness in their reading of the poet.\n\n===Influence theory===\n\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|A lion-faced [[deity]] associated with [[Gnosticism]]. Bloom frequently referred to Gnosticism when speaking about general and personal religious matters.]]\n\nAfter a personal crisis during the late 1960s, Bloom became deeply interested in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the ancient mystic traditions of [[Gnosticism]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hermeticism]]. In a 2003 interview with Bloom, [[Michael Pakenham]], the book editor for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', posited that Bloom has long referred to himself as a \"Jewish Gnostic\". Bloom explained: \"I am using Gnostic in a very broad way. I am nothing if not Jewish... I really am a product of Yiddish culture. But I can't understand a [[Yahweh]], or a [[God]], who could be all-powerful and all knowing and would allow the [[Nazi death camps]] and [[schizophrenia]].\"<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = In Full Bloom: Guerrilla In Our Midst\n  |last = Pakenham\n  |first = Michael\n  |website = [[The Baltimore Sun]]\n  |date = March 23, 2003\n  |accessdate = September 15, 2016\n  |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-03-23/entertainment/0303240442_1_bloom-dining-room-table\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Influenced by his reading, he began a series of books that focused on the way in which poets struggled to create their own individual poetic visions without being overcome by the influence of the previous poets who inspired them to write.\n\nThe first of these books, ''Yeats'', a magisterial examination of [[William Butler Yeats|the poet]], challenged the conventional critical view of his poetic career. In the introduction to this volume, Bloom set out the basic principles of his new approach to criticism: \"Poetic influence, as I conceive it, is a variety of melancholy or the anxiety-principle.\" New poets become inspired to write because they have read and admired the poetry of previous poets; but this admiration turns into resentment when the new poets discover that these poets whom they idolized have already said everything they wish to say. The poets become disappointed because they \"cannot be [[Adam]] early in the morning. There have been too many Adams, and they have named everything.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn order to evade this psychological obstacle, according to Bloom, new poets must be convinced that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving open the possibility that they may have something to add to the tradition after all. The new poets' love for their heroes turns into antagonism towards them: \"Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible.\"<ref>''Map of Misreading'', p. 10.</ref> The book that followed ''Yeats'', ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]'', which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of [[Walter Jackson Bate]]'s ''The Burden of the Past and The English Poet'' and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by 17th and 18th-century poets about their ability to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which poets broke free from their precursors to achieve their own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between \"strong poets\" who perform \"strong misreadings\" of their precursors, and \"weak poets\" who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of \"revisionary ratios\", through which each strong poet passes in the course of their career.\n\n====Addenda and developments of his theory====\n''A Map of Misreading'' picked up where ''The Anxiety of Influence'' left off, making several adjustments to Bloom's system of revisionary ratios. ''Kabbalah and Criticism'' attempted to invoke the esoteric interpretive system of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], as explicated by scholar [[Gershom Scholem]], as an alternate system of mapping the path of poetic influence. ''Figures of Capable Imagination'' collected odd pieces Bloom had written in the process of composing his \"influence\" books.\n\nBloom continued to write about influence theory throughout the 1970s and '80s, and penned little thereafter that did not invoke his ideas about influence.\n\n===Novel experiment===\nBloom's fascination with the fantasy novel ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]] led him to take a brief break from criticism in order to compose a sequel to Lindsay's novel. This novel, ''[[The Flight to Lucifer]]'', was Bloom's only work of fiction.<ref name=\"The Violet Apple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.violetapple.org.uk/notes/bloom_flighttolucifer.php|title=The Flight to Lucifer review|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Religious criticism===\nBloom then entered a phase of what he called \"religious criticism\", beginning with ''Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present'' (1989).\n\nIn ''The Book of J'' (1990), he and [[David Rosenberg (poet)|David Rosenberg]] (who translated the Biblical texts) portrayed one of the posited ancient documents that formed the basis of the first five books of the Bible (see [[documentary hypothesis]]) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a [[dogmatic]]ally religious work (see [[Jahwist]]). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings [[David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]]\u2014a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations did not go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical [[Bathsheba]].<ref>Bloom, Harold, ''The Western Canon. The Books and Schools of the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace & Company, 1994, p. 5.</ref> In ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in ''The Book of J'' in discussing the significance of [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of [[Christianity and Judaism]].\n\nIn ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), Bloom surveyed the major varieties of [[Protestant]] and post-Protestant religious faiths that originated in the United States and argued that, in terms of their psychological hold on their adherents, most shared more in common with [[gnosticism]] than with historical Christianity. The exception was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whom Bloom regards as non-Gnostic. He elsewhere predicted that the [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] strains of [[American Christianity]] would overtake mainstream Protestant divisions in popularity in the next few decades. In ''Omens of Millennium'' (1996), Bloom identifies these American religious elements as on the periphery of an old \u2013 and not inherently Christian \u2013 gnostic, religious tradition which invokes a complex of ideas and experiences concerning [[angelology]], interpretation of dreams as [[prophecy]], [[near-death experience]]s, and [[millennialism]].<ref>Bloom (1996), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn his essay in ''The Gospel of Thomas'', Bloom states that none of Thomas' [[Aramaic]] sayings have survived in the original language.<ref>Bloom, Harold. \"A Reading\", in ''The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus''. English translation and critical edition of the Coptic text by Marvin W. Meyer. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992, pp. 115 and 119.</ref> [[Marvin Meyer]] generally agreed and further confirmed that the earlier versions of that text were likely written in either Aramaic or Greek.<ref>Mayer, Marvin. \"Introduction\".

Bloom asserted that the goals of reading must be solitary [[aesthetic]] pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal of improving one's society held by \"forces of resentment\". He cast the latter as an absurd aim, writing: \"The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading [[Shakespeare]] is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools.\" His position was that politics had no place in literary criticism, that a [[feminist]] or [[Marxist]] reading of ''[[Hamlet]]'' would tell us something about feminism and Marxism but probably nothing about ''Hamlet'' itself.\n\nIn addition to considering how much influence a writer had had on later writers, Bloom proposed the concept of \"canonical strangeness\" (cf. [[uncanny]]) as a benchmark of a literary work's merit. ''The Western Canon'' also included a list\u2014which aroused more widespread interest than anything else in the volume\u2014of all the Western works from antiquity to the present that Bloom considered either permanent members of the canon of literary classics, or (among more recent works) candidates for that status. Bloom said that he made the list off the top of his head at his editor's request, and that he did not stand by it.<ref name=vice />\n\n===Work on Shakespeare===\n[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]] (1564\u20131616)]]\n\nBloom had a deep appreciation for [[William Shakespeare]]<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;2\u20133.</ref> and considered him to be the supreme center of the Western canon.<ref>Bloom (1994), pp.&nbsp;24\u20135.</ref> The first edition of ''The Anxiety of Influence'' almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom then considered barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, added a long preface that mostly expounded Shakespeare's debt to [[Ovid]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], and his [[agon#Literature|agon]] with contemporary [[Christopher Marlowe]], who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.\n\nIn his later survey, ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (1998), Bloom provided an analysis of each of Shakespeare's 38 plays, \"twenty-four of which are masterpieces.\" Written as a companion to the general reader and theater-goer, Bloom declared that [[bardolatry]] \"ought to be even more a secular religion than it already is.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''. New York: Riverhead, 1998, p. xix.</ref> He also contended in the work (as in the title) that Shakespeare \"invented\" humanity, in that he prescribed the now-common practice of \"overhearing\" ourselves, which drives our changes. The two paragons of his theory were [[Sir John Falstaff]] of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], whom Bloom saw as representing self-satisfaction and self-loathing, respectively. Throughout ''Shakespeare'', characters from disparate plays were imagined alongside and interacting with each other. This has been decried by numerous contemporary academics and critics as harking back to the out of fashion character criticism of [[A. C. Bradley]] (and others), who gathered explicit praise in the book. As in ''The Western Canon'', Bloom criticized what he called the \"School of Resentment\" for its failure to live up to the challenge of Shakespeare's universality and for [[Balkanization|balkanizing]] the study of literature through multicultural and [[New Historicism|historicist]] departments. Asserting Shakespeare's singular popularity throughout the world, Bloom proclaimed him the only truly multicultural author. Repudiating the \"social energies\" to which historicists ascribed Shakespeare's authorship, Bloom pronounced his modern academic foes \u2013 and indeed, all of society \u2013 to be but \"a parody of Shakespearian energies.\"\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nBloom consolidated his work on the western canon with the publication of ''How to Read and Why'' (2000) and ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' (2003). ''Hamlet: Poem Unlimited'' (also 2003) is an amendment to ''Shakespeare: Invention of the Human'' written after he decided the chapter on ''Hamlet'' in that earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself. Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in ''Where Shall Wisdom Be Found'' (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2005). Throughout the decade he also compiled, edited and introduced several major anthologies of poetry.\n\nBloom took part in the documentary, the ''[[Apparition of the Eternal Church]]'' (2006), made by [[Paul Festa]]. This documentary centered on many individuals' reactions to hearing, for the first time, Olivier Messiaen's organ piece ''[[Apparition de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9ternelle]]''.\n\nBloom began a book under the working title of ''Living Labyrinth'', centering on Shakespeare and [[Walt Whitman]], which was published as ''The Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life'' (2011).\n\nIn July 2011, after the publication of ''The Anatomy of Influence'' and after finishing work on ''The Shadow of a Great Rock'', Bloom was working on three further projects:\n* ''Achievement in the Evening Land from Emerson to [[Faulkner]]'', a history of American literature following the canonical model, which ultimately developed into his book ''The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime'' (2015).\n* ''The Hum of Thoughts Evaded in the Mind: A Literary Memoir'', which ultimately developed into his book ''Possessed by Memory: The Inward Light of Criticism'' (2019).\n* a play with the working title ''Walt Whitman: A Musical Pageant''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioopensource.org/harold-bloom-on-the-playing-field-of-poetry/|title=Harold Bloom: On the Playing Field of Poetry - Open Source with Christopher Lydon|author=|date=July 5, 2011|website=www.radioopensource.org|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref> By November 2011, Bloom had changed the title of the play to ''To You Whoever You Are: A Pageant Celebrating Walt Whitman''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/will-this-election-be-the-mormon-breakthrough.html \"Will This Election Be the Mormon Breakthrough?\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|In ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|The Western Canon]]'', Bloom claimed that [[Samuel Johnson]] was \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him.\"]]\n\nIn 1986, Bloom credited [[Northrop Frye]] as his nearest precursor. He told [[Imre Salusinszky]] in 1986: \"In terms of my own theorizations&nbsp;... the precursor proper has to be Northrop Frye. I purchased and read ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'' a week or two after it had come out and reached the bookstore in Ithaca, New York. It ravished my heart away. I have tried to find an alternative father in Mr. [[Kenneth Burke]], who is a charming fellow and a very powerful critic, but I don't come from Burke, I come out of Frye.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html#roots|title=Presidential Lectures: Harold Bloom: Interviews|author=|date=|website=prelectur.stanford.edu|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in ''Anatomy of Influence'' (2011), he wrote \"I no longer have the patience to read anything by Frye\" and nominated Angus Fletcher of the City University of New York among his living contemporaries as his \"critical guide and conscience\" and elsewhere that year recommended Fletcher's ''Colors of the Mind'' and ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' by [[M. H. Abrams]]. In this late phase of his career, Bloom also emphasized the tradition of earlier critics such as [[William Hazlitt]], Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Walter Pater]], [[A. C. Bradley]], and [[Samuel Johnson]], describing Johnson in ''The Western Canon'' as \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him\". In his 2012 Foreword to the book ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012), Bloom indicated the influence which M. H. Abrams had upon him in his years at Cornell University.<ref>M. H. Abrams. ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012).</ref>\n\nBloom's theory of poetic influence regards the development of [[Western literature]] as a process of borrowing and misreading. Writers find their creative inspiration in previous writers and begin by imitating those writers in order to develop a poetic voice of their own; however, they must make their own work different from that of their precursors. As a result, Bloom argues, authors of real power must inevitably \"misread\" their precursors' works in order to make room for fresh imaginings.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2225/the-art-of-criticism-no-1-harold-bloom| title=Harold Bloom, The Art of Criticism No. 1| journal=Paris Review| volume=Spring 1991| issue=118| date=Spring 1991| author=Antonio Weiss}}</ref><ref>Paul Fry, [http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-14 \"Engl 300: Introduction To Theory Of Literature\"].

He told [[Robert Moynihan]] in 1983, \"What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through [[apophatic theology|negative theology]]&nbsp;...

In the late 1980s, Bloom told an interviewer: \"Probably the most powerful living Western writer is [[Samuel Beckett]].

After Murdoch died, Bloom expressed admiration for novelists such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], [[Will Self]], [[John Banville]], and [[A. S. Byatt]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Genius : a mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds|year=2002|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-69129-1|page=648|quote=There are a few affinities, except perhaps with the admirable Antonia Byatt, in the generation after: novelists I also now admire, like Will Self, Peter Ackroyd, and John Banville.}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' (2003), he named the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer and Nobel Prize winner [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]] as \"the most gifted novelist alive in the world today\", and as \"one of the last titans of an expiring literary genre\".\n\nOf American novelists, he declared in 2003 that \"there are four living American novelists I know of who are still at work and who deserve our praise\".<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ \"Dumbing Down American Readers\"], ''Boston Globe'', September 24, 2003. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617015302/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ |date=June 17, 2006 }}</ref> He claimed that \"they write the Style of our Age, each has composed canonical works,\" and he identified them as [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Don DeLillo]].

Rapid technology change, low initial cost, and planned obsolescence have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of computers and other electronic components around the globe.

It is important to note that the IT equipment being liquidated ranges from new technology to old technology. Because of the relatively lower price for secondary market equipment, some companies may even purchase tech devices from the secondary market to use as backups, stocking the equipment themselves preemptively so that a replacement is always on hand in the event of trouble.

But networking [[Computer hardware|hardware]] can often see service lives of five years or more, and resellers and computer liquidators might carry products that are upwards of a decade old. End users that use a particular product may find it much easier and cheaper to add/replace an older device rather than take on the costs, business disruptions, and knowledge gaps that occur when upgrading to new products.

G. Wells]], published in 1933, which speculates on future events up to the year 2106.\n\nA long economic slump causes a major war that leaves Europe devastated and threatened by plague. The nations with the strongest air-forces set up a benevolent dictatorship that paves the way for [[world peace]] by abolishing national divisions, enforcing the English language, promoting scientific learning and outlawing religion. The enlightened world-citizens are able to depose the dictators peacefully, and go on to breed a new race of super-talents, able to maintain a permanent utopia.\n \nSome of Wells\u2019 short-term predictions would come true, such as the [[Aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombing of whole cities]] presented in more detail than in his previous ''[[The War in the Air]]'' and the eventual development of [[Nukes|weapons of mass destruction]]. Others, such as the withering of state-power and the dissolution of [[Islam]], were rather wider off the mark.\n\n==Plot==\nAs a [[frame story]], Wells claims that the book is his edited version of notes written by an eminent diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who had been having dream visions of a history textbook published in 2106 and wrote down what he could remember of it. It is split into five separate sections or \"books\":\n#Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns \u2013 The history of the world up to 1933.\n#The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration \u2013 1933\u20131960.\n#The World Renaissance: The Birth of the Modern State \u2013 1960\u20131978.\n#The Modern State Militant \u2013 1978\u20132059.\n#The Modern State in Control of Life \u2013 2059 to New Year's Day 2106.\n\nThe book was written as a [[future history]]. In late 1933 or early 1934, [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s failure to implement the [[New Deal]] and revive the [[US economy]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failure to revive the [[German economy]] by [[German re-armament|rearmament]] causes the worldwide [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] to continue for thirty years, concurrently with the war, as described above.\n\nWells predicted a [[Second World War]] breaking out with a European conflagration from the flashpoint of a violent clash between Germans and Poles at [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]]. Wells set its date as January 1940, quite close to the actual date of September 1939.  Wells's imagined war sharply diverges from the actual war when [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] proves a military match for [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], in an inconclusive war that lasts ten years.  More countries are eventually dragged into the fighting, but [[Third French Republic|France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] are only marginally involved, the [[United Kingdom]] remains neutral and the [[United States]] fights inconclusively with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. The Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' happens during, rather than before, the war. [[Czechoslovakia]] avoids German occupation and its President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] survives to initiate the final \"Suspension of Hostilities\" in 1950.\n\nWells' prediction was widely off the mark with regard to [[Spain]], which the book assumed would manage to stay away from the violent passions sweeping the rest of Europe.  In real life, the [[Spanish Civil War]] would become the main focus of these passions, two years after the book was published.  Evidently, Wells greatly overestimated the influence of Spanish Liberals such as [[Unamuno]] on Spanish society as a whole.\n\nWells correctly predicted that the coming war would involve both sides launching heavy bombings of each other's main cities, and his detailed depiction of the destroyed [[Unter Den Linden]] closely predicted its actual fate in the war.  However, Wells wrongly assumed that land fighting would quickly bog down, as in [[World War I]], and that the idea of using [[tank]]s to develop a [[maneuver warfare|war of movement]] would come to naught.  Wells predicted that [[submarine]]s would become the launching pads for \"air torpedoes\" ([[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|missiles]]) carrying [[weapons of mass destruction]], enabling a country to threaten the destruction of places halfway around the world although that actually happened decades after World War II.\n\nWells' predicted war ends with no victor but total exhaustion, collapse and disintegration of all the fighting states and of the neutral countries, which are equally affected by the deepening economic crisis. The whole world descends into chaos: nearly all governments break down, and a devastating [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1956 and 1957 kills a large part of humanity and almost destroys civilization.\n\nWells then envisages a [[benevolent dictatorship]], \"[[Aerial Board of Control|The Dictatorship of the Air]]\", which arises from the controllers of the world's surviving transport systems, who are the only people with global power. The dictatorship promotes [[science]], enforces [[Basic English]] as a global [[lingua franca]] and eradicates all [[religion]]s, setting the world on the road to a peaceful [[utopia]]. When the dictatorship chooses to murder a subject, the condemned person is given a chance to take a poison tablet (modelled on the [[Apiaceae|Hemlock]] given to [[Socrates]]).\n\nThe achievement of a [[classless society]] is not via a Marxist [[Dictatorship of the Proletariat]], an idea that Wells completely rejected. Rather, the [[working class]] is massively \"pulled upwards\" and completely eliminated in several generations of intensive [[upward social mobility]], in effect leaving a humanity entirely composed of \"middle class intellectuals\". The limited amount of physical labor still needed is performed by the world's youths, who undergo two years of \"labor conscription\" instead of military conscription, which is no longer needed..\n\nEventually, after about 100 years of reshaping humanity, the Dictatorship of the Air is overthrown in a completely-bloodless [[coup]], the former rulers are sent into a very honourable retirement and the world state \"withers away\". The last part of the book is a detailed description of the utopian world that emerges. The ultimate aim of this utopian world is to produce a world society composed entirely of [[polymath]]s, every one of its members being the intellectual equal of the greatest geniuses of the past.\n\nThe book displays one of the earliest uses of the abbreviation \"C.E.\", which Wells explains as \"[[Christian Era]]\" but it is now more usually understood as \"[[Common Era]]\".<ref>{{Citation | last = Wells | first = HG | chapter-url = http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301391h.html#i01 | at = \u00a71. A Chronological Note | chapter = Introduction | title = The Shape of Things to Come | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\n==Suppression of religion==\nOne of the major aspects of the creation of the World State is the abolition of all organised religion, which is deemed indispensable to give the emerging \"Modern State\" a monopoly over education and the complete ability to mould new generations of humanity.\n\nThe abolition of [[Islam]] is carried out by the Air Police, who \"descend upon [[Mecca]] and close down the main holy places\", apparently without major incident. Eventually, Islam disappears, its demise accelerated by the decay of [[Arabic]] and its replacement by \"an expanded English\".  Some 20 mosques survive, deemed to be worthy of preservation on architectural grounds.  The [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese-American]] scholar George Nasser remarked on this aspect of Wells' book: \"In the 1979 imagined by HG Wells, a self-appointed ruling elite composed mainly of Westerners, with one Chinese and one Black African and not a single Arab member, would establish itself in the Arab and Muslim city of [[Basra]] and calmly take the decision to completely extinguish and extirpate the Muslim religion.... In the 1979 of real history, [[Khomeini]]'s [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] came into being\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Dr. George | last = Nasser | contribution = The Long Tortuous and Arrogant Road to 9/11, pp.&nbsp;4\u20135 | editor-first = Barbara | editor-last = Wheatley | title = The West and Islam, Islam and the West: Confrontation or Accommodation?}}.</ref>\n\nThere is only a brief reference to the abolition of [[Buddhism]] and no reference to any serious problem encountered by the Modern State in eradicating it from [[East Asia]].\n\nThe most prolonged and formidable religious opposition envisaged by Wells is from the [[Catholic Church]]. (There is little reference to [[Protestants]].) The [[Pope]] and the entire Catholic hierarchy are gassed unconscious when they bless the new aircraft, built by a revived [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]].  After the Catholic Church is decisively crushed in Italy, it finds refuge in [[Ireland]], \"the last bastion of [[Christianity]]\" until it is subdued, and then the resistance is maintained only in [[Latin America]], under \"a coloured Pope in [[Pernambuco]]\", until that too is put down.\n\nWells gives considerable attention to the fate of the [[Jews]]. In this history, an enfeebled [[Nazi Germany]] is incapable of systematic murder on the scale of the [[Holocaust]]. However, Jews greatly suffer from \"unorganized\" persecution, and there is a reference to anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s happening \"everywhere in Europe\" during the chaotic 1950s. Then, in a world where all nation-states are a doomed anachronism, [[Zionism]] and its ambition to create a new state come to naught. In the later struggle between the emerging world state and its opponents, Jews are seen as caught between the hammer and the anvil. Following the launch of its antireligious campaign, the Modern State closes down all [[kosher]] butcheries still in operation, while the opening act of the \"Federated Nationalist\" rebels opposing the Modern State is to perpetrate a pogrom against Jews in the [[Frankfurt]] area. Eventually, in Wells's vision, it is the Modern State's forced assimilation that triumphs and the Jews, who had resisted earlier such pressures, become completely absorbed in the general society and lose their separate identity.\n\n==Democracy, fascism and communism==\n\nIn the 1930s, especially after the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], the survival of European democracy seemed in doubt. Wells, not a great supporter of democracy even in its more robust times, clearly shared that outlook.  The future history book, from the vantage point of 2106, notes that at the outbreak of war in 1940, [[France]] was still a [[Parliamentary Democracy]], the implication clearly being that it was an outmoded form of government on its way out.  The visionary Gustave de Windt, setting out the blueprint for the coming \"Modern State\", rejects categorically \"[[Opposition (parliamentary)|The Principle of Opposition]]\", which by definition rules out Parliamentary Democracy.\n\nWells' posterity remembers [[fascism]] more as ridiculous and stupid than as horrible. In the war envisioned in the book, an enfeebled [[Nazi Germany]] got bogged down in its war with [[Poland]] and never achieved vast conquests or engaged in [[The Holocaust]] but finally collapsed and disintegrated (no mention is made of [[Hitler]]'s ultimate fate, and the historian of 2106 clearly considers it to be unimportant).\n\nNazism disappears without a trace, and an attempt to revive [[Italian Fascism]] is easily swept away by the triumphant Modern State.  The book notes that many people who were fascists or Nazis in their early years had become staunch adherents of the Modern State in the more mature part of their lives.\n\nThat posterity remembers [[Stalin]] as having been narrow and limited in his understanding but not as a bloody dictator. The [[Soviet Union]] is less affected than other countries by the worldwide chaos and disintegration of the late 1940s and the 1950s. With the rise of the Modern State, [[Russia]] experiences a bloodless takeover by the pilots and other skilled technicians, who displace the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] bureaucrats and eagerly assimilate into the new worldwide state. In the transition time, the old [[Hammer and Sickle]] is displayed side by side with the Modern State's Winged Disk.\n\nAltogether, of the three competing systems of government (Democracy, Fascism and Communism) only the last would be remembered by Wells' Modern State as having been to some degree a predecessor of itself.\n\n==Relation to ''Brave New World''==\n{{original research section|date=June 2018}}\n''The Shape of Things to Come'' was published two years after [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. The two share the same basic outline of humanity's future: a massive war leaves the world in ruins, a self-appointed elite takes over, rebuilds the world and engages in very thorough [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to refashion human society completely. Wells explicitly acknowledges that relationship in the book itself; when the future history book discusses the \"Dictatorship of the Air\" and its leadership, it is noted, \"As Aldous Huxley, one of the most brilliant of the reactionary writers, foretold of them, they tidied up the world\".\n\nThe crucial difference is in the kind of future society built up in the two books. The future society envisioned by Huxley is rigidly hierarchical, divided into five psychologically-conditioned castes, ranging from the highly intelligent and assertive Alphas on top to the subservient and moronic Epsilons at the bottom. As Huxley's cynical administrator Mustafa Mond asserts, such moronic underclasses are absolutely essential as society's \"gyroscope\" since a society composed entirely of intelligent and assertive \"Alphas\" would inevitably collapse in all-out conflict since all members would seek to improve their position at the expense of the others'.\n\nIt was that vision that Wells believed would cause Huxley to be remembered by posterity as a \"reactionary writer\". Much of ''Shape of Things to Come'' is devoted to demonstrating that the century-long dedicated and intensive work by an elite possessing complete control of world education can make such a society of intelligent and assertive \"Alphas\" harmonious and functional, with no underclasses.\n\n==Adaptations==\nWells loosely adapted the novel for the screenplay of the film ''[[Things to Come]]'', produced by [[Alexander Korda]] and directed by [[William Cameron Menzies]], and released in 1936.  It also takes elements from Wells's non-fiction book ''[[The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind]]'' (1931). The film stars [[Raymond Massey]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Cedric Hardwicke]] and [[Margaretta Scott]].\n\n''[[H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come]]'' is a Canadian science fiction motion picture first released in May 1979.  Although credited to [[H. G. Wells]], the film takes only its title and some character names from the original source material. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The film was an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of such recent successes as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and TV series such as ''[[Space: 1999]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', although the film had only a fraction of the production budget of any of these.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/109740/The-Shape-of-Things-to-Come/overview | title = The Shape of Things to Come | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Big Finish Productions]] released a 2017 audio adaptation loosely based on the novel, adapted by [[Guy Adams]], starring [[Nicola Walker]] and [[Sam Troughton]] and directed by [[Lisa Bowerman]]. This version presents events as taking part in an alternate timeline which Raven is shown, rather than the dreams of the original novel.\n\n==Influence on later science fiction==\nTheodore Wein<ref>{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein|  title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction |chapter = 1|page = 5,7}}.</ref> pointed out that \"Wells' ''Things to Come'' was at its most influential in the six years between its publication and the moment when the course of its predicted war was overtaken and overshadowed by the actual fast-unfolding events of the Second World War. These same years of the 1930s were the time of incubation for the people who were destined to become the greatest names in Science Fiction, the time when they read ravenously any SF on which they could lay their hands and started to formulate their own ideas. It is not surprising that traces of ''Things to Come'' are clearly visible in what they wrote in the 1940s and 1950s.\" Among such great names of Golden Age Science Fiction, Wein noted [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Robert Heinlein]] and [[Poul Anderson]], and he enumerated in the work of all three \u2013 as well of some lesser known SF writers \u2013 some influences which could be traced to \"Things to Come\".\n\n[[Rex Warner]]'s [[dystopian]] novel ''The Aerodrome'' (1941) is partly a fictional critique of ''The Shape of Things to Come'', with Wells' \"Air Police\" transformed into the [[fascism|fascistic]] \"Airmen\".<ref>\" In a literary response to ''Things to Come'', Rex Warner's allegorical novel ''The Aerodrome'' (1941) is, alas, little known. Its Air Vice-Marshal, who rejects the human world as it is...proposes the training of \"a new and more adequate race of men\": the Wellsian program exactly\". [[Leon Stover|Leon E. Stover]], ''Science Fiction From Wells To Heinlein''.  Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland, 2002. {{ISBN|0786412194}}  (p. 45)</ref>\n\nWells depicted the European social scientist Gustave De Windt sitting down at the [[British Museum Library]] and setting out the precise blueprint for a transformation of the world which he would not live to see. This, in Theodore Wein's opinion, may have inspired [[Isaac Asimov]]'s character [[Hari Seldon]]. Wein noted: \"Wells' De Windt, conducting his library research in London, capital of the declining British Empire, realized that the world was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Wells's book details how  De Windt's disciples, the Modern State Society, set about implementing De Windt's vision. Asimov's Seldon conducted  his library research in the Imperial Library of [[Trantor]], capital of the declining Galactic Empire. He realized that the Galaxy was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Asimov's Foundation Series details how Seldon's disciples, the First Foundation and the Second one, set about implementing Seldon's vision.\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein | title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction | chapter = 3,4|page = 17,43}}</ref>\n\nWein also points to Wells' \"Encyclopaedic organization which centres upon Barcelona, with its seventeen million active workers\" which is tasked with creating \"the Fundamental Knowledge System which accumulates, sorts, keeps in order and renders available everything that is known\" as a possible inspiration for Asimov's ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', whose compilation was the original task of the First Foundation and quotes from which are sprinkled throughout the Foundation Series.<ref>{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein | title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction | chapter = 4|pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nThe British Wells had the planes of the emerging World State overfly [[Washington, D.C.]] and undermine the authority of the [[President of the United States]]. A decade later, the American [[Robert Heinlein]] wrote \"[[Solution Unsatisfactory]]\" in which planes of the International Patrol do the same. Later, Heinlein upgraded the International Patrol into an [[Space Cadet|Interplanetary Patrol]], a self-appointed elite of highly motivated and rather puritanical spacemen reminiscent of those enforcing Wells' \"Dictatorship of the Air\".\n\nWells depicted \"Federated Nationalists\" who had banded together only so that they could fly at each other's throats once they had smashed the budding world government. [[Poul Anderson]] in his early future history, [[The Psychotechnic League]], depicted precisely the same kind of Nationalists violently opposing the [[United Nations]]' efforts to make itself a true world government and rebuild the war-torn world.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Bibliowiki|The Shape of Things to Come|''The Shape of Things to Come''}}\n*[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301391h.html Full Text from Project Gutenberg]\n\n{{H.

The enlightened world-citizens are able to depose the dictators peacefully, and go on to breed a new race of super-talents, able to maintain a permanent utopia.\n \nSome of Wells\u2019 short-term predictions would come true, such as the [[Aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombing of whole cities]] presented in more detail than in his previous ''[[The War in the Air]]'' and the eventual development of [[Nukes|weapons of mass destruction]]. Others, such as the withering of state-power and the dissolution of [[Islam]], were rather wider off the mark.\n\n==Plot==\nAs a [[frame story]], Wells claims that the book is his edited version of notes written by an eminent diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who had been having dream visions of a history textbook published in 2106 and wrote down what he could remember of it. It is split into five separate sections or \"books\":\n#Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns \u2013 The history of the world up to 1933.\n#The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration \u2013 1933\u20131960.\n#The World Renaissance: The Birth of the Modern State \u2013 1960\u20131978.\n#The Modern State Militant \u2013 1978\u20132059.\n#The Modern State in Control of Life \u2013 2059 to New Year's Day 2106.\n\nThe book was written as a [[future history]]. In late 1933 or early 1934, [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s failure to implement the [[New Deal]] and revive the [[US economy]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failure to revive the [[German economy]] by [[German re-armament|rearmament]] causes the worldwide [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] to continue for thirty years, concurrently with the war, as described above.\n\nWells predicted a [[Second World War]] breaking out with a European conflagration from the flashpoint of a violent clash between Germans and Poles at [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]]. Wells set its date as January 1940, quite close to the actual date of September 1939.  Wells's imagined war sharply diverges from the actual war when [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] proves a military match for [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], in an inconclusive war that lasts ten years.  More countries are eventually dragged into the fighting, but [[Third French Republic|France]] and the [[Soviet Union]] are only marginally involved, the [[United Kingdom]] remains neutral and the [[United States]] fights inconclusively with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. The Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' happens during, rather than before, the war. [[Czechoslovakia]] avoids German occupation and its President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] survives to initiate the final \"Suspension of Hostilities\" in 1950.\n\nWells' prediction was widely off the mark with regard to [[Spain]], which the book assumed would manage to stay away from the violent passions sweeping the rest of Europe.  In real life, the [[Spanish Civil War]] would become the main focus of these passions, two years after the book was published.  Evidently, Wells greatly overestimated the influence of Spanish Liberals such as [[Unamuno]] on Spanish society as a whole.\n\nWells correctly predicted that the coming war would involve both sides launching heavy bombings of each other's main cities, and his detailed depiction of the destroyed [[Unter Den Linden]] closely predicted its actual fate in the war.  However, Wells wrongly assumed that land fighting would quickly bog down, as in [[World War I]], and that the idea of using [[tank]]s to develop a [[maneuver warfare|war of movement]] would come to naught.  Wells predicted that [[submarine]]s would become the launching pads for \"air torpedoes\" ([[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|missiles]]) carrying [[weapons of mass destruction]], enabling a country to threaten the destruction of places halfway around the world although that actually happened decades after World War II.\n\nWells' predicted war ends with no victor but total exhaustion, collapse and disintegration of all the fighting states and of the neutral countries, which are equally affected by the deepening economic crisis. The whole world descends into chaos: nearly all governments break down, and a devastating [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1956 and 1957 kills a large part of humanity and almost destroys civilization.\n\nWells then envisages a [[benevolent dictatorship]], \"[[Aerial Board of Control|The Dictatorship of the Air]]\", which arises from the controllers of the world's surviving transport systems, who are the only people with global power. The dictatorship promotes [[science]], enforces [[Basic English]] as a global [[lingua franca]] and eradicates all [[religion]]s, setting the world on the road to a peaceful [[utopia]]. When the dictatorship chooses to murder a subject, the condemned person is given a chance to take a poison tablet (modelled on the [[Apiaceae|Hemlock]] given to [[Socrates]]).\n\nThe achievement of a [[classless society]] is not via a Marxist [[Dictatorship of the Proletariat]], an idea that Wells completely rejected. Rather, the [[working class]] is massively \"pulled upwards\" and completely eliminated in several generations of intensive [[upward social mobility]], in effect leaving a humanity entirely composed of \"middle class intellectuals\". The limited amount of physical labor still needed is performed by the world's youths, who undergo two years of \"labor conscription\" instead of military conscription, which is no longer needed..\n\nEventually, after about 100 years of reshaping humanity, the Dictatorship of the Air is overthrown in a completely-bloodless [[coup]], the former rulers are sent into a very honourable retirement and the world state \"withers away\". The last part of the book is a detailed description of the utopian world that emerges. The ultimate aim of this utopian world is to produce a world society composed entirely of [[polymath]]s, every one of its members being the intellectual equal of the greatest geniuses of the past.\n\nThe book displays one of the earliest uses of the abbreviation \"C.E.\", which Wells explains as \"[[Christian Era]]\" but it is now more usually understood as \"[[Common Era]]\".<ref>{{Citation | last = Wells | first = HG | chapter-url = http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301391h.html#i01 | at = \u00a71. A Chronological Note | chapter = Introduction | title = The Shape of Things to Come | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg Australia]]}}.</ref>\n\n==Suppression of religion==\nOne of the major aspects of the creation of the World State is the abolition of all organised religion, which is deemed indispensable to give the emerging \"Modern State\" a monopoly over education and the complete ability to mould new generations of humanity.\n\nThe abolition of [[Islam]] is carried out by the Air Police, who \"descend upon [[Mecca]] and close down the main holy places\", apparently without major incident. Eventually, Islam disappears, its demise accelerated by the decay of [[Arabic]] and its replacement by \"an expanded English\".  Some 20 mosques survive, deemed to be worthy of preservation on architectural grounds.  The [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanese-American]] scholar George Nasser remarked on this aspect of Wells' book: \"In the 1979 imagined by HG Wells, a self-appointed ruling elite composed mainly of Westerners, with one Chinese and one Black African and not a single Arab member, would establish itself in the Arab and Muslim city of [[Basra]] and calmly take the decision to completely extinguish and extirpate the Muslim religion.... In the 1979 of real history, [[Khomeini]]'s [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] came into being\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Dr. George | last = Nasser | contribution = The Long Tortuous and Arrogant Road to 9/11, pp.&nbsp;4\u20135 | editor-first = Barbara | editor-last = Wheatley | title = The West and Islam, Islam and the West: Confrontation or Accommodation?}}.</ref>\n\nThere is only a brief reference to the abolition of [[Buddhism]] and no reference to any serious problem encountered by the Modern State in eradicating it from [[East Asia]].\n\nThe most prolonged and formidable religious opposition envisaged by Wells is from the [[Catholic Church]]. (There is little reference to [[Protestants]].) The [[Pope]] and the entire Catholic hierarchy are gassed unconscious when they bless the new aircraft, built by a revived [[Fascist Italy]].  After the Catholic Church is decisively crushed in Italy, it finds refuge in [[Ireland]], \"the last bastion of [[Christianity]]\" until it is subdued, and then the resistance is maintained only in [[Latin America]], under \"a coloured Pope in [[Pernambuco]]\", until that too is put down.\n\nWells gives considerable attention to the fate of the [[Jews]]. In this history, an enfeebled [[Nazi Germany]] is incapable of systematic murder on the scale of the [[Holocaust]]. However, Jews greatly suffer from \"unorganized\" persecution, and there is a reference to anti-Jewish [[pogrom]]s happening \"everywhere in Europe\" during the chaotic 1950s. Then, in a world where all nation-states are a doomed anachronism, [[Zionism]] and its ambition to create a new state come to naught. In the later struggle between the emerging world state and its opponents, Jews are seen as caught between the hammer and the anvil. Following the launch of its antireligious campaign, the Modern State closes down all [[kosher]] butcheries still in operation, while the opening act of the \"Federated Nationalist\" rebels opposing the Modern State is to perpetrate a pogrom against Jews in the [[Frankfurt]] area. Eventually, in Wells's vision, it is the Modern State's forced assimilation that triumphs and the Jews, who had resisted earlier such pressures, become completely absorbed in the general society and lose their separate identity.\n\n==Democracy, fascism and communism==\n\nIn the 1930s, especially after the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], the survival of European democracy seemed in doubt. Wells, not a great supporter of democracy even in its more robust times, clearly shared that outlook.  The future history book, from the vantage point of 2106, notes that at the outbreak of war in 1940, [[France]] was still a [[Parliamentary Democracy]], the implication clearly being that it was an outmoded form of government on its way out.  The visionary Gustave de Windt, setting out the blueprint for the coming \"Modern State\", rejects categorically \"[[Opposition (parliamentary)|The Principle of Opposition]]\", which by definition rules out Parliamentary Democracy.\n\nWells' posterity remembers [[fascism]] more as ridiculous and stupid than as horrible. In the war envisioned in the book, an enfeebled [[Nazi Germany]] got bogged down in its war with [[Poland]] and never achieved vast conquests or engaged in [[The Holocaust]] but finally collapsed and disintegrated (no mention is made of [[Hitler]]'s ultimate fate, and the historian of 2106 clearly considers it to be unimportant).\n\nNazism disappears without a trace, and an attempt to revive [[Italian Fascism]] is easily swept away by the triumphant Modern State.  The book notes that many people who were fascists or Nazis in their early years had become staunch adherents of the Modern State in the more mature part of their lives.\n\nThat posterity remembers [[Stalin]] as having been narrow and limited in his understanding but not as a bloody dictator. The [[Soviet Union]] is less affected than other countries by the worldwide chaos and disintegration of the late 1940s and the 1950s. With the rise of the Modern State, [[Russia]] experiences a bloodless takeover by the pilots and other skilled technicians, who displace the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] bureaucrats and eagerly assimilate into the new worldwide state. In the transition time, the old [[Hammer and Sickle]] is displayed side by side with the Modern State's Winged Disk.\n\nAltogether, of the three competing systems of government (Democracy, Fascism and Communism) only the last would be remembered by Wells' Modern State as having been to some degree a predecessor of itself.\n\n==Relation to ''Brave New World''==\n{{original research section|date=June 2018}}\n''The Shape of Things to Come'' was published two years after [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. The two share the same basic outline of humanity's future: a massive war leaves the world in ruins, a self-appointed elite takes over, rebuilds the world and engages in very thorough [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to refashion human society completely. Wells explicitly acknowledges that relationship in the book itself; when the future history book discusses the \"Dictatorship of the Air\" and its leadership, it is noted, \"As Aldous Huxley, one of the most brilliant of the reactionary writers, foretold of them, they tidied up the world\".\n\nThe crucial difference is in the kind of future society built up in the two books. The future society envisioned by Huxley is rigidly hierarchical, divided into five psychologically-conditioned castes, ranging from the highly intelligent and assertive Alphas on top to the subservient and moronic Epsilons at the bottom. As Huxley's cynical administrator Mustafa Mond asserts, such moronic underclasses are absolutely essential as society's \"gyroscope\" since a society composed entirely of intelligent and assertive \"Alphas\" would inevitably collapse in all-out conflict since all members would seek to improve their position at the expense of the others'.\n\nIt was that vision that Wells believed would cause Huxley to be remembered by posterity as a \"reactionary writer\". Much of ''Shape of Things to Come'' is devoted to demonstrating that the century-long dedicated and intensive work by an elite possessing complete control of world education can make such a society of intelligent and assertive \"Alphas\" harmonious and functional, with no underclasses.\n\n==Adaptations==\nWells loosely adapted the novel for the screenplay of the film ''[[Things to Come]]'', produced by [[Alexander Korda]] and directed by [[William Cameron Menzies]], and released in 1936.  It also takes elements from Wells's non-fiction book ''[[The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind]]'' (1931). The film stars [[Raymond Massey]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Cedric Hardwicke]] and [[Margaretta Scott]].\n\n''[[H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come]]'' is a Canadian science fiction motion picture first released in May 1979.  Although credited to [[H. G. Wells]], the film takes only its title and some character names from the original source material. The film's plot has no relationship to the events of the book. The film was an attempt to capitalise on the popularity of such recent successes as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and TV series such as ''[[Space: 1999]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', although the film had only a fraction of the production budget of any of these.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/109740/The-Shape-of-Things-to-Come/overview | title = The Shape of Things to Come | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Big Finish Productions]] released a 2017 audio adaptation loosely based on the novel, adapted by [[Guy Adams]], starring [[Nicola Walker]] and [[Sam Troughton]] and directed by [[Lisa Bowerman]]. This version presents events as taking part in an alternate timeline which Raven is shown, rather than the dreams of the original novel.\n\n==Influence on later science fiction==\nTheodore Wein<ref>{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein|  title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction |chapter = 1|page = 5,7}}.</ref> pointed out that \"Wells' ''Things to Come'' was at its most influential in the six years between its publication and the moment when the course of its predicted war was overtaken and overshadowed by the actual fast-unfolding events of the Second World War. These same years of the 1930s were the time of incubation for the people who were destined to become the greatest names in Science Fiction, the time when they read ravenously any SF on which they could lay their hands and started to formulate their own ideas. It is not surprising that traces of ''Things to Come'' are clearly visible in what they wrote in the 1940s and 1950s.\" Among such great names of Golden Age Science Fiction, Wein noted [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Robert Heinlein]] and [[Poul Anderson]], and he enumerated in the work of all three \u2013 as well of some lesser known SF writers \u2013 some influences which could be traced to \"Things to Come\".\n\n[[Rex Warner]]'s [[dystopian]] novel ''The Aerodrome'' (1941) is partly a fictional critique of ''The Shape of Things to Come'', with Wells' \"Air Police\" transformed into the [[fascism|fascistic]] \"Airmen\".<ref>\" In a literary response to ''Things to Come'', Rex Warner's allegorical novel ''The Aerodrome'' (1941) is, alas, little known. Its Air Vice-Marshal, who rejects the human world as it is...proposes the training of \"a new and more adequate race of men\": the Wellsian program exactly\". [[Leon Stover|Leon E. Stover]], ''Science Fiction From Wells To Heinlein''.  Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland, 2002. {{ISBN|0786412194}}  (p. 45)</ref>\n\nWells depicted the European social scientist Gustave De Windt sitting down at the [[British Museum Library]] and setting out the precise blueprint for a transformation of the world which he would not live to see. This, in Theodore Wein's opinion, may have inspired [[Isaac Asimov]]'s character [[Hari Seldon]]. Wein noted: \"Wells' De Windt, conducting his library research in London, capital of the declining British Empire, realized that the world was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Wells's book details how  De Windt's disciples, the Modern State Society, set about implementing De Windt's vision. Asimov's Seldon conducted  his library research in the Imperial Library of [[Trantor]], capital of the declining Galactic Empire. He realized that the Galaxy was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Asimov's Foundation Series details how Seldon's disciples, the First Foundation and the Second one, set about implementing Seldon's vision.\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein | title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction | chapter = 3,4|page = 17,43}}</ref>\n\nWein also points to Wells' \"Encyclopaedic organization which centres upon Barcelona, with its seventeen million active workers\" which is tasked with creating \"the Fundamental Knowledge System which accumulates, sorts, keeps in order and renders available everything that is known\" as a possible inspiration for Asimov's ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', whose compilation was the original task of the First Foundation and quotes from which are sprinkled throughout the Foundation Series.<ref>{{Citation | first = Theodore | last = Wein | title = HG Wells and the Golden Age of Science Fiction | chapter = 4|pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nThe British Wells had the planes of the emerging World State overfly [[Washington, D.C.]] and undermine the authority of the [[President of the United States]]. A decade later, the American [[Robert Heinlein]] wrote \"[[Solution Unsatisfactory]]\" in which planes of the International Patrol do the same. Later, Heinlein upgraded the International Patrol into an [[Space Cadet|Interplanetary Patrol]], a self-appointed elite of highly motivated and rather puritanical spacemen reminiscent of those enforcing Wells' \"Dictatorship of the Air\".\n\nWells depicted \"Federated Nationalists\" who had banded together only so that they could fly at each other's throats once they had smashed the budding world government. [[Poul Anderson]] in his early future history, [[The Psychotechnic League]], depicted precisely the same kind of Nationalists violently opposing the [[United Nations]]' efforts to make itself a true world government and rebuild the war-torn world.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Bibliowiki|The Shape of Things to Come|''The Shape of Things to Come''}}\n*[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0301391h.html Full Text from Project Gutenberg]\n\n{{H.
