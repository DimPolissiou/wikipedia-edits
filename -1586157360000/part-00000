The position is held by the leader of the [[List of political parties in Australia|party]] not in government that has the most seats in the House. When in [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]], the Leader of the Opposition sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the Opposition and opposite the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. The Opposition Leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new Opposition Leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.</onlyinclude>\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] and is based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]]. The term [[Opposition (politics)|Opposition]] has a specific meaning in the parliamentary sense. It is an important component of the Westminster system, with the Opposition directing criticism at the Government and attempts to defeat and replace the Government. The Opposition is therefore known as the \"Government in waiting\" and it is a formal part of the parliamentary system. It is in opposition to the Government, but not to [[the Crown]]; hence the term \"Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Jaensch | first = Dean | authorlink = Dean Jaensch | title = The Politics of Australia | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan Education Australia]] | year = 1997 | location = Melbourne | pages = 100 | isbn = 0-7329-4128-8}}</ref>\n\nTo date there have been 34 Opposition Leaders, 18 of whom have served terms as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"hftn\">{{cite web|title=A House for the nation |work=Commonwealth of Australia |url=http://www.houseforthenation.gov.au/explore/ahn03_p9.html |accessdate=14 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830183221/http://www.houseforthenation.gov.au/explore/ahn03_p9.html |archivedate=30 August 2007 |df= }}</ref> The current Leader of the Opposition is [[Anthony Albanese]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]], following an [[2019 Australian Labor Party leadership election|election of the new Parliamentary Labor Leader by caucus and ALP members]] on 30 May 2019. The current Deputy Leader of the Opposition is [[Richard Marles]], who was elected deputy leader of the ALP on the same date.\n\n==Role==\nThe opposition leader is the opposition's counterpart to the [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]]. He or she is expected to be ready to form a new government if the incumbent government is unable to continue in office. This typically occurs when the opposition wins a [[Elections in Australia|federal election]], after which the opposition leader is appointed prime minister. However, the opposition leader may also be called upon to form government if the incumbent government loses the confidence of the House ([[Fadden Government|most recently in 1941]]) or that of the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]] ([[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|most recently in 1975]]).<ref name=aph>{{cite news|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/The_(official)_Opposition|title=The (official) Opposition|work=House of Representatives Practice|edition=7th|year=2018|access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe opposition leader is the head of the [[Shadow Ministry of Australia|shadow ministry]], allocating portfolios and, in the case of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]], determining its membership. He or she is assisted by a deputy leader of the opposition, who is also recognised in the standing orders and entitled to an additional salary. Both the opposition leader and deputy opposition leader are entitled to a degree of special preference from the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].<ref name=aph/>\n\nThe position of opposition leader has no [[Constitution of Australia|constitutional basis]] but exists as a matter of convention in the [[Westminster system]]. A 1960 inquiry into parliamentary salaries and allowances observed:<ref name=aph/>\n\n<blockquote>The Leader of the Opposition has to make himself master of all the business which comes before the House (not merely that of one or two departments); he has to do this at times at short notice and under constant pressure; and he gets no help from permanent officials. At all times he is the spokesman for those who are critical of or opposed to the Government, and he must be unceasingly vigilant and active. He and the Prime Minister should be the most powerful agents in guiding and forming public opinion on issues of policy.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n[[George Reid]] became the ''de facto'' leader of the opposition in the lead-up to the inaugural [[1901 Australian federal election|1901 federal election]], following the appointment of [[Edmund Barton]] to lead a [[caretaker government]] as Australia's first prime minister. His status was confirmed when the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] met for the first time after the election. The opposition leader was initially not entitled to any salary or entitlements beyond those of an ordinary member of parliament. As a result, Reid had to maintain his legal practice in Sydney to support himself and was able to attend just over one-third of the sitting days in the first session of parliament.<ref name=heriot>{{cite web|url=https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/6493674/upload_binary/6493674.pdf|title=Australia's first Parliament: Her Majesty's loyal opposition|work=FlagPost|publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library|first=Dianne|last=Heriot|date=12 February 2019|access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the role was firmly established, the House did not formally recognise the position of opposition leader in its records until 1920.<ref name=aph/> It was recognised by statute for the first time with the passage of the ''Parliamentary Allowances Act 1920'', which granted its holder an additional allowance.<ref name=heriot/> Prime Minister [[Andrew Fisher]] had previously offered Opposition Leader [[Alfred Deakin]] an allowance in 1910.

The position is held by the leader of the [[List of political parties in Australia|party]] not in government that has the most seats in the House. When in [[Parliament of Australia|parliament]], the Leader of the Opposition sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the Opposition and opposite the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. The Opposition Leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new Opposition Leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.</onlyinclude>\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] and is based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]]. The term [[Opposition (politics)|Opposition]] has a specific meaning in the parliamentary sense. It is an important component of the Westminster system, with the Opposition directing criticism at the Government and attempts to defeat and replace the Government. The Opposition is therefore known as the \"Government in waiting\" and it is a formal part of the parliamentary system. It is in opposition to the Government, but not to [[the Crown]]; hence the term \"Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Jaensch | first = Dean | authorlink = Dean Jaensch | title = The Politics of Australia | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan Education Australia]] | year = 1997 | location = Melbourne | pages = 100 | isbn = 0-7329-4128-8}}</ref>\n\nTo date there have been 34 Opposition Leaders, 18 of whom have served terms as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"hftn\">{{cite web|title=A House for the nation |work=Commonwealth of Australia |url=http://www.houseforthenation.gov.au/explore/ahn03_p9.html |accessdate=14 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830183221/http://www.houseforthenation.gov.au/explore/ahn03_p9.html |archivedate=30 August 2007 |df= }}</ref> The current Leader of the Opposition is [[Anthony Albanese]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]], following an [[2019 Australian Labor Party leadership election|election of the new Parliamentary Labor Leader by caucus and ALP members]] on 30 May 2019. The current Deputy Leader of the Opposition is [[Richard Marles]], who was elected deputy leader of the ALP on the same date.\n\n==Role==\nThe opposition leader is the opposition's counterpart to the [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]]. He or she is expected to be ready to form a new government if the incumbent government is unable to continue in office. This typically occurs when the opposition wins a [[Elections in Australia|federal election]], after which the opposition leader is appointed prime minister. However, the opposition leader may also be called upon to form government if the incumbent government loses the confidence of the House ([[Fadden Government|most recently in 1941]]) or that of the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]] ([[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|most recently in 1975]]).<ref name=aph>{{cite news|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/Practice7/HTML/Chapter2/The_(official)_Opposition|title=The (official) Opposition|work=House of Representatives Practice|edition=7th|year=2018|access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe opposition leader is the head of the [[Shadow Ministry of Australia|shadow ministry]], allocating portfolios and, in the case of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]], determining its membership. He or she is assisted by a deputy leader of the opposition, who is also recognised in the standing orders and entitled to an additional salary. Both the opposition leader and deputy opposition leader are entitled to a degree of special preference from the [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]].<ref name=aph/>\n\nThe position of opposition leader has no [[Constitution of Australia|constitutional basis]] but exists as a matter of convention in the [[Westminster system]]. A 1960 inquiry into parliamentary salaries and allowances observed:<ref name=aph/>\n\n<blockquote>The Leader of the Opposition has to make himself master of all the business which comes before the House (not merely that of one or two departments); he has to do this at times at short notice and under constant pressure; and he gets no help from permanent officials. At all times he is the spokesman for those who are critical of or opposed to the Government, and he must be unceasingly vigilant and active. He and the Prime Minister should be the most powerful agents in guiding and forming public opinion on issues of policy.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n[[George Reid]] became the ''de facto'' leader of the opposition in the lead-up to the inaugural [[1901 Australian federal election|1901 federal election]], following the appointment of [[Edmund Barton]] to lead a [[caretaker government]] as Australia's first prime minister. His status was confirmed when the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] met for the first time after the election. The opposition leader was initially not entitled to any salary or entitlements beyond those of an ordinary member of parliament. As a result, Reid had to maintain his legal practice in Sydney to support himself and was able to attend just over one-third of the sitting days in the first session of parliament.<ref name=heriot>{{cite web|url=https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/6493674/upload_binary/6493674.pdf|title=Australia's first Parliament: Her Majesty's loyal opposition|work=FlagPost|publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library|first=Dianne|last=Heriot|date=12 February 2019|access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the role was firmly established, the House did not formally recognise the position of opposition leader in its records until 1920.<ref name=aph/> It was recognised by statute for the first time with the passage of the ''Parliamentary Allowances Act 1920'', which granted its holder an additional allowance.<ref name=heriot/> Prime Minister [[Andrew Fisher]] had previously offered Opposition Leader [[Alfred Deakin]] an allowance in 1910.

The beamline is designed to study chemical and electronic, structural and magnetic properties by means of XAS, XNLD (X-ray natural linear dichroism) and XMCD (X-ray magnetic circular dichroism), XMLD (X-ray magnetic linear dichroism), respectively. It is suitable for probing element specific properties of surfaces, interfaces, thin films and nanomaterials. The available photon energy range (200\u20132000 eV) covers the absorption K edges for light elements, from carbon to silicon, L edges of elements with Z between 20 and 40, including 3d elements, and also M edges of many heavier atoms, including 4f elements.\nThe offered experimental stations are:\n- a photoemission electron microscope (PEEM);\n- a universal station for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).\n\nBoth end stations are available for user's experiments in different sample environments and focusing conditions. Users can apply for beamtime with the PEEM or XAS end station. In order to prepare for their experiment, users are asked to look at the end stations' webpages.\n\n'''UARPES''' - Ultra angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy beamline allows for measurements of fundamental quantities, i.e. the energy and the momentum, describing a photoelectron state in the space outside the solid sample.\n\nIf a spin selector is used additionally, a complete set of quantum numbers for the electron may be obtained. Then, within a so-called sudden approximation, the electron energy, momentum and spin measured over the sample surface may be related, to binding energy, quasimomentum, and spin, that the electron had in the solid before the photoelectric event took place. Thus the electronic band structure of the studied solid is obtained experimentally. Beside this simple picture ARPES gives also detailed insights into complex electron \u2013 electron and electron \u2013 lattice interactions in the solid.\n\nThe importance of the ARPES technique for contemporary science and technology is widely recognized. Dedicated ARPES beamlines exist at almost all synchrotron radiation centers worldwide.\n\nApplications:\nMany recent advances in materials science have been enabled by better understanding of the electronic structure of complex systems, gained due to ARPES studies. Examples include advances in fields such as: high temperature superconductivity, topological insulators, graphene physics.\n\n===Beamlines under construction===\n'''\u2009XMCD''' - the beamline will use variable polarization radiation, the source of which will be the EPU - elliptically polarizing undulator. \nApplications: the XMCD beamline include magnetic order research, domain structure research, imaging of chemical composition, biomolecular spectroscopy, and fluorescence detection.\n\n'''\u2009PHELIX''' - PHELIX is a beamline using soft X-rays, the source of which is an APPLE II undulator with permanent magnets. \nApplications: new materials for spintronics and magneto-electronics, topological insulators, thin films and multilayer systems including samples obtained in-situ, surface of bulk compounds, surface magnetism, spin polarized surface states, chemical reactions taking place on the surface, and biomaterials.\n \n'''SOLABS\u2009''' - an X-ray absorption spectroscopy beamline, whose synchrotron light source will be a bending magnet. The line will deliver photons within a broad energy range, allowing measurements to be conducted at the absorption edges of many elements.\n\nApplications: The endstation will be intended for materials research of both a basic and applied nature. \n'''SOLCRYS''' - a wiggler-based, high energy X-ray beamline (up to 25 keV) for structural studies. \nApplications: in structural studies (biological, macromolecular, pharmaceutical, crystalline materials, etc.) also performed under extreme conditions (high pressure, temperature).\n\n===Planned beamlines===\n'''FTIR''' an absorption infrared microscopy beamline (FTIR) with imaging. \nApplications: biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental sciences and many others.

Notable alumni include astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], poet [[Jan Kochanowski]], Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], [[Constitution of 3 May 1791|constitutional reformer]] [[Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj]], chemist [[Karol Olszewski]], anthropologist [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]], writer [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]], and [[President of Poland]] [[Andrzej Duda]]. Students at the University who did ''not'' earn diplomas included [[Nobel laureates]]  [[Ivo Andri\u0107]] and [[Wis\u0142awa Szymborska]].

The university consists of fifteen faculties, including the humanities, law, the natural and social sciences, and medicine. The university employs roughly 4,000 academics, and has more than 40,000 students who study in some 80 disciplines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/overview|title=Overview \u2013 UJ|website=www.en.uj.edu.pl|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> More than half of the student body are women. The language of instruction is usually [[Polish language|Polish]], although several degrees are offered in either [[German language|German]] or [[English language|English]]. The university library is one of Poland's largest, and houses several medieval manuscripts, including Copernicus' [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|''De Revolutionibus'']].\n\nDue to its history, the Jagiellonian University is traditionally considered Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning, this standing equally being reflected in international rankings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/europe/poland/guide|title=Study in Poland|date=2014-09-03|newspaper=Top Universities|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/jagiellonian-university|title=Jagiellonian University|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> The Jagiellonian University is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]] and [[Europaeum]].\n\nIn 2019, the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU) placed the university within the 301\u2013400 band globally.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html |title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019 |access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding the university===\n[[File:Za\u0142o\u017cenie Szko\u0142y G\u0142\u00f3wnej przeniesieniem do Krakowa ugruntowane (Matejko UJ).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The founding of the University in 1364, painted by [[Jan Matejko]] (1838\u20131893).]]\nIn the mid-14th century, [[Kazimierz III the Great|King Casimir III the Great]] realised that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in [[Poland]] were rewarded when [[Pope Urban V]] granted him permission to set up a university in Krak\u00f3w. A [[royal charter]] of foundation was issued on 12 May 1364, and a simultaneous document was issued by the City Council granting privileges to the ''[[Studium Generale]]''. The [[King of Poland|King]] provided funding for one chair in [[liberal arts]], two in Medicine, three in [[Canon Law]] and five in [[Roman Law]], funded by a quarterly payment taken from the proceeds of the royal monopoly on the salt mines at [[Wieliczka]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Davies|title=God's Playground; A History of Poland, Vol. I: The Origins to 1795|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-231-05351-8|page=98}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of the University of Krak\u00f3w stalled upon the death of [[Kazimierz III Wielki|King Casimir]], its founder, and lectures were held in various places across the city, including, amongst others, in professors' houses, churches and in the cathedral school on the Wawel Hill. It is believed that, in all likelihood, the construction of a building to house the ''Studium Generale'' began on Plac Wolnica in what is today the district of Kazimierz.\n\nAfter a period of disinterest and lack of funds, the institution was restored in the 1390s by [[Jogaila|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] and his wife [[Jadwiga of Poland|Saint Hedwig]], the daughter of King Louis of [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. The royal couple decided that, instead of building new premises for the university, it would be better to buy an existing edifice; it was thus that a building on \u017bydowska Street, which had previously been the property of the P\u0119cherz family, was found and acquired in 1399. The Queen donated all of her personal [[jewelry]] to the university, allowing it to enroll 203 students. The faculties of astronomy, law and theology attracted eminent scholars: for example, [[John Cantius]], [[Stanis\u0142aw of Skarbimierz]], [[Pawe\u0142 W\u0142odkowic]], [[Jan of G\u0142og\u00f3w]], and [[Albert Brudzewski]], who from 1491 to 1495 was one of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' teachers. The university was the first university in Europe to establish independent chairs in [[Mathematics]] and [[Astronomy]]. This rapid expansion in the university's faculty necessitated the purchase of larger premises in which to house them; it was thus that the building known today as the ''[[Collegium Maius]]'', with its quadrangle and beautiful arcade, came into being towards the beginning of the 15th century. The ''Collegium Maius''' qualities, many of which directly contributed to the sheltered, academic atmosphere at the university, became widely respected, helping the university establish its reputation as a place of learning in [[Central Europe]].\n\n===Golden age of the Renaissance===\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w.Uniwersytet Jagiello\u0144ski.Collegium Maius.Aula Jagiello\u0144ska.jpg|left|thumb|The main assembly hall of the university's ''[[Collegium Maius]]'']]\nFor several centuries, virtually the entire intellectual elite of Poland were educated at the university,<ref>source needed</ref> where they enjoyed particular royal favour, often being provided with game from the royal hunt to satisfy their needs at mealtime. Whilst it was, and largely remains, Polish students who make up the greater part of the university's student body, it has, over its long history, educated thousands of foreign students from countries such as [[Lithuania]], [[Russia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]]. During the second half of the 15th century, over 40 percent of students came from outside the [[Kingdom of Poland]].\n\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w - Collegium Iuridicum - Brama 01.JPG|upright|thumb|The main baroque entrance to the university's ''Collegium Iuridicum'']]\nThe first chancellor of the University was [[Piotr Wysz]], and the first professors were [[Czech people|Czech]]s, [[German people|Germans]] and Poles, many of them trained at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]] in [[Bohemia]]. By 1520 Greek philology was introduced by Constanzo Claretti and Wenzel von Hirschberg; [[Hebrew]] was also taught. At this time, the ''Collegium Maius'' comprised seven reading rooms, six of which were named for the great ancient scholars: [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Galen]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Pythagoras]]. Furthermore, it was during this period that the faculties of Law, Medicine, Theology, and Philosophy were established in their own premises; two of these buildings, the ''Collegium Iuridicum'' and ''Collegium Minus'', survive to this day. The golden era of the University of Krak\u00f3w took place during the [[Polish Renaissance]], between 1500 and 1535, when it was attended by 3,215 students in the first decade of the 16th century, and it was in these early years that the foundations for the [[Jagiellonian Library]] were set, with the addition of a library floor to the ''Collegium Maius''. The library's original rooms, in which all books were chained to their cases in order to prevent theft, are no longer used as such. However, they are still occasionally opened to host visiting lecturers' talks.\n\nAs the university's popularity, along with that of the ever more provincial Krak\u00f3w's, declined in later centuries, the number of students attending the university also fell and, as such, the attendance record set in the early 16th century was not again surpassed until the late 18th century. This phenomenon was recorded as part of a more general economic and political decline seen in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which was suffering from the effects of poor governance and the policies of hostile neighbors at the time. In fact, despite a number of expansion projects during the late 18th century, many of the university's buildings had fallen into disrepair and were being used for a range of other purposes; in the university's archives there is one entry which reads: 'Nobody lives in the building, nothing happens there. If the lecture halls underwent refurbishment they could be rented out to accommodate a laundry'. This period thus represents one of the darkest periods in the university's history and is almost certainly the one during which the closure of the institution seemed most imminent.\n\n===Decline and near closure after the partitions===\n[[File:Collegium Novum UJ 02 Krakow.jpg|left|thumb|The ''[[Collegium Novum]]'' in the [[Krak\u00f3w Old Town|Old Town District]]]]\nAfter the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]] in 1795 and the ensuing [[Napoleonic Wars]], Krak\u00f3w became a [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w|free city]] under the protection of the [[Austrian Empire]]; this, however, was not to last long. In 1846, after the [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising]], the city and its university became part of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref name=\"officialhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/uniwersytet/historia|title=History|last=Waltos|first=Stanis\u0142aw|publisher=Jagiellonian University|accessdate=2010-09-28}} &nbsp;{{in lang|pl}}</ref> The Austrians were in many ways hostile to the institution and, soon after their arrival, removed many of the furnishings from the ''Collegium Maius''' ''Auditorium Maximum'' in order to convert it into a grain store. However, the threat of closure of the University was ultimately dissipated by ''[[Kaiser]]'' [[Ferdinand I of Austria]]'s decree to maintain it. By the 1870s the fortunes of the university had improved so greatly that many scholars had returned. The liquefaction of nitrogen and oxygen was successfully demonstrated by professors Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski in 1883. Thereafter the Austrian authorities took on a new role in the development of the university and provided funds for the construction of a number of new buildings, including the neo-gothic ''[[Collegium Novum]]'', which opened in 1887.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> It was, conversely, from this building that in 1918 a large painting of ''[[Kaiser]]'' [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was removed and [[Iconoclasm|destroyed]] by Polish students advocating the reestablishment of an independent Polish state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/wladyslaw-jan-pochwalski |title=W\u0142adys\u0142a Jan Pochwalski |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Stanislaw Tarnowski.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Count]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski]] was, between 1871 and 1909, twice rector of the university.]]\n\n[[File:BASA-1771K-1-1163-32-Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.jpeg|thumb|The university around 1930|left]]\nFor the 500th anniversary of the university's foundation, a monument to [[Copernicus]] was placed in the quadrangle of the ''Collegium Maius''; this statue is now to be found in the direct vicinity of the ''Collegium Novum'', outside the ''Collegium Witkowskiego'', to where it was moved in 1953.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sztuka.net/palio/html.run?_Instance=sztuka&_PageID=857&newsId=7361&_cms=newser&callingPageId=856&_CheckSum=-282421568 |title=Krak\u00f3w - Pomnik Miko\u0142aja Kopernika |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> Nevertheless, it was in the Grzeg\u00f3rzecka and the Kopernika areas that much of the university's expansion took place up to 1918; during this time the ''Collegium Medicum'' was relocated to a site just east of the centre, and was expanded with the addition of a number of modern teaching hospitals \u2013 this 'medical campus' remains to this day. By the late 1930s the number of students at the university had increased dramatically to almost six thousand. Now a major centre for education in the independent [[Republic of Poland]], the university attained government support for the purchase of building plots for new premises, as a result of which a number of residencies were built for students and professors alike. However, of all the projects begun during this era, the most important would have to be the creation of the [[Jagiellonian Library]]. The library's monumental building, construction of which began in 1931, was finally completed towards the end of the interwar period, which allowed the university's many varied literary collections to be relocated to their new home by the outbreak of war in 1939.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bj.uj.edu.pl/historia |title=Dzieje Biblioteki Jagiello\u0144skiej |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n\nOn November 6, 1939, following the [[Nazi invasion of Poland]], 184 professors were arrested and deported to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] during an operation codenamed ''[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]'' (Special Operation Krakow). The university, along with the rest of Poland's higher and secondary education, was closed for the remainder of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"pp2bio\">{{cite book| last = Weigel| first = George| title = Witness of Hope \u2013 The Biography of Pope John Paul II| publisher = HarperCollins| year = 2001| isbn = 978-0-06-018793-4| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/witnesstohopebio00weig}}</ref> Despite the university's reopening after the cessation of hostilities in 1945, the new government of Poland was hostile to the teachings of the pre-war university and the faculty was suppressed by the [[Communist Poland|Communists]] in 1954.<ref name=\"pp2bio\"/> By 1957 the Polish government decided that it would invest in the establishment of new facilities near [[Jordan Park]] and expansion of other smaller existing facilities. Construction work proved slow and many of the stated goals were never achieved; it was this poor management that eventually led a number of scholars to openly criticise the government for its apparent lack of interest in educational development and disregard for the university's future. A number of new buildings, such as the ''Collegium Biologicum'', were built with funds from the legacy of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]].\n\nBy 1991 Poland had overthrown its Communist government. In that same year the Jagiellonian University successfully completed the purchase of its first building plot in [[Pychowice]], Krak\u00f3w, where, from 2000, construction of a new complex of university buildings, the so-called Third Campus, began. The new campus, officially named the '600th Anniversary Campus', was developed in conjunction with the new LifeScience Park, which is managed by the Jagiellonian Centre for Innovation, the university's research consortium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/en/rozwoj/kampus|title=Campus of the Sixcentenary|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref> Public funds earmarked for the project amounted to 946.5&nbsp;million [[zloty]]s, or 240&nbsp;million [[euro]]s.<ref name=ThirdCampus>{{cite web|url=http://www.kampus.uj.edu.pl/|title=Campus of the Sixcentenary|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> Poland's entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004 has proved instrumental in improving the fortunes of the Jagiellonian University, which has seen huge increases in funding from both central government and European authorities, allowing it to develop new departments, research centres, and better support the work of its students and academics.\n\n===International partnerships===\nThe Jagiellonian University maintains an academic partnership with [[Heidelberg University]], Germany's oldest university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/international/profil/partneruniversitaeten.html|title=Partneruniversit\u00e4ten  \u2013 International \u2013 Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg|last=Watzke|first=Christian|website=www.uni-heidelberg.de|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> In particular, there are close ties between both Heidelberg's and Krak\u00f3w's law schools.

Last accessed on 4 May 2007.</ref> however, instead of having one central library it had several smaller branches at buildings of various departments (the largest collection was in ''[[Collegium Maius]]'', where works related to [[theology]] and [[liberal arts]] were kept). After 1775, during the reforms of [[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]], which established the first [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education in the world, various small libraries of the University were formally centralised into one public collection in ''Collegium Maius''. During the [[partitions of Poland]], the library continued to grow thanks to the support of such people as [[Karol J\u00f3zef Teofil Estreicher]] and [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]]. Its collections were made public in 1812. Since 1932, it has been recognised as a [[legal deposit]] library, comparable to the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University Library]] or [[Trinity College Library]] in [[Dublin]], and thus has the right to receive a copy of any book issued by Polish publishers within Poland. In 1940, the library finally obtained a new building of its own, which has subsequently been expanded on two occasions, most recently in 1995\u20132001. During the [[Second World War]], library workers cooperated with [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground universities]]. Since the 1990s, the library's collection has become increasingly digitised.\n\nIn addition to the Jagiellonian Library, the university maintains a large medical library (''Biblioteka Medyczna'') and many other subject specialised libraries in its various faculties and institutes. Finally, the collections of the university libraries' collections are enriched by the presence of the university's archives, which date back to the university's own foundation and record the entire history of its development up to the present day.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w - Pomnik Miko\u0142aja Kopernika 02.JPG|thumb|upright|140px|[[Monument]] to [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] next to Jagiellonian University's ''[[Collegium Novum]]'']]\n[[File:Ignacy Lukasiewicz.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]]]]\n[[File:Bronislawmalinowski.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]]]]\n[[File:Krzysztof Penderecki 20080706.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Krzysztof Penderecki]]]]\n[[File:John Paul II Medal of Freedom 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Pope John Paul II]]]]\n<!---Graduation year should be placed if available--->\n* [[John Cantius|Saint John Cantius]] 1390\u20131473;

Notable alumni include astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], poet [[Jan Kochanowski]], Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], [[Constitution of 3 May 1791|constitutional reformer]] [[Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj]], chemist [[Karol Olszewski]], anthropologist [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]], writer [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]], and [[President of Poland]] [[Andrzej Duda]]. Students at the University who did ''not'' earn diplomas included [[Nobel laureates]]  [[Ivo Andri\u0107]] and [[Wis\u0142awa Szymborska]].

The university consists of fifteen faculties, including the humanities, law, the natural and social sciences, and medicine. The university employs roughly 4,000 academics, and has more than 40,000 students who study in some 80 disciplines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about-university/overview|title=Overview \u2013 UJ|website=www.en.uj.edu.pl|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> More than half of the student body are women. The language of instruction is usually [[Polish language|Polish]], although several degrees are offered in either [[German language|German]] or [[English language|English]]. The university library is one of Poland's largest, and houses several medieval manuscripts, including Copernicus' [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|''De Revolutionibus'']].\n\nDue to its history, the Jagiellonian University is traditionally considered Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning, this standing equally being reflected in international rankings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/europe/poland/guide|title=Study in Poland|date=2014-09-03|newspaper=Top Universities|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/jagiellonian-university|title=Jagiellonian University|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> The Jagiellonian University is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]] and [[Europaeum]].\n\nIn 2019, the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU) placed the university within the 301\u2013400 band globally.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html |title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019 |access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding the university===\n[[File:Za\u0142o\u017cenie Szko\u0142y G\u0142\u00f3wnej przeniesieniem do Krakowa ugruntowane (Matejko UJ).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The founding of the University in 1364, painted by [[Jan Matejko]] (1838\u20131893).]]\nIn the mid-14th century, [[Kazimierz III the Great|King Casimir III the Great]] realised that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in [[Poland]] were rewarded when [[Pope Urban V]] granted him permission to set up a university in Krak\u00f3w. A [[royal charter]] of foundation was issued on 12 May 1364, and a simultaneous document was issued by the City Council granting privileges to the ''[[Studium Generale]]''. The [[King of Poland|King]] provided funding for one chair in [[liberal arts]], two in Medicine, three in [[Canon Law]] and five in [[Roman Law]], funded by a quarterly payment taken from the proceeds of the royal monopoly on the salt mines at [[Wieliczka]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Davies|title=God's Playground; A History of Poland, Vol. I: The Origins to 1795|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-231-05351-8|page=98}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of the University of Krak\u00f3w stalled upon the death of [[Kazimierz III Wielki|King Casimir]], its founder, and lectures were held in various places across the city, including, amongst others, in professors' houses, churches and in the cathedral school on the Wawel Hill. It is believed that, in all likelihood, the construction of a building to house the ''Studium Generale'' began on Plac Wolnica in what is today the district of Kazimierz.\n\nAfter a period of disinterest and lack of funds, the institution was restored in the 1390s by [[Jogaila|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] and his wife [[Jadwiga of Poland|Saint Hedwig]], the daughter of King Louis of [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. The royal couple decided that, instead of building new premises for the university, it would be better to buy an existing edifice; it was thus that a building on \u017bydowska Street, which had previously been the property of the P\u0119cherz family, was found and acquired in 1399. The Queen donated all of her personal [[jewelry]] to the university, allowing it to enroll 203 students. The faculties of astronomy, law and theology attracted eminent scholars: for example, [[John Cantius]], [[Stanis\u0142aw of Skarbimierz]], [[Pawe\u0142 W\u0142odkowic]], [[Jan of G\u0142og\u00f3w]], and [[Albert Brudzewski]], who from 1491 to 1495 was one of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' teachers. The university was the first university in Europe to establish independent chairs in [[Mathematics]] and [[Astronomy]]. This rapid expansion in the university's faculty necessitated the purchase of larger premises in which to house them; it was thus that the building known today as the ''[[Collegium Maius]]'', with its quadrangle and beautiful arcade, came into being towards the beginning of the 15th century. The ''Collegium Maius''' qualities, many of which directly contributed to the sheltered, academic atmosphere at the university, became widely respected, helping the university establish its reputation as a place of learning in [[Central Europe]].\n\n===Golden age of the Renaissance===\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w.Uniwersytet Jagiello\u0144ski.Collegium Maius.Aula Jagiello\u0144ska.jpg|left|thumb|The main assembly hall of the university's ''[[Collegium Maius]]'']]\nFor several centuries, virtually the entire intellectual elite of Poland were educated at the university,<ref>source needed</ref> where they enjoyed particular royal favour, often being provided with game from the royal hunt to satisfy their needs at mealtime. Whilst it was, and largely remains, Polish students who make up the greater part of the university's student body, it has, over its long history, educated thousands of foreign students from countries such as [[Lithuania]], [[Russia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]]. During the second half of the 15th century, over 40 percent of students came from outside the [[Kingdom of Poland]].\n\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w - Collegium Iuridicum - Brama 01.JPG|upright|thumb|The main baroque entrance to the university's ''Collegium Iuridicum'']]\nThe first chancellor of the University was [[Piotr Wysz]], and the first professors were [[Czech people|Czech]]s, [[German people|Germans]] and Poles, many of them trained at the [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]] in [[Bohemia]]. By 1520 Greek philology was introduced by Constanzo Claretti and Wenzel von Hirschberg; [[Hebrew]] was also taught. At this time, the ''Collegium Maius'' comprised seven reading rooms, six of which were named for the great ancient scholars: [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Galen]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Pythagoras]]. Furthermore, it was during this period that the faculties of Law, Medicine, Theology, and Philosophy were established in their own premises; two of these buildings, the ''Collegium Iuridicum'' and ''Collegium Minus'', survive to this day. The golden era of the University of Krak\u00f3w took place during the [[Polish Renaissance]], between 1500 and 1535, when it was attended by 3,215 students in the first decade of the 16th century, and it was in these early years that the foundations for the [[Jagiellonian Library]] were set, with the addition of a library floor to the ''Collegium Maius''. The library's original rooms, in which all books were chained to their cases in order to prevent theft, are no longer used as such. However, they are still occasionally opened to host visiting lecturers' talks.\n\nAs the university's popularity, along with that of the ever more provincial Krak\u00f3w's, declined in later centuries, the number of students attending the university also fell and, as such, the attendance record set in the early 16th century was not again surpassed until the late 18th century. This phenomenon was recorded as part of a more general economic and political decline seen in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which was suffering from the effects of poor governance and the policies of hostile neighbors at the time. In fact, despite a number of expansion projects during the late 18th century, many of the university's buildings had fallen into disrepair and were being used for a range of other purposes; in the university's archives there is one entry which reads: 'Nobody lives in the building, nothing happens there. If the lecture halls underwent refurbishment they could be rented out to accommodate a laundry'. This period thus represents one of the darkest periods in the university's history and is almost certainly the one during which the closure of the institution seemed most imminent.\n\n===Decline and near closure after the partitions===\n[[File:Collegium Novum UJ 02 Krakow.jpg|left|thumb|The ''[[Collegium Novum]]'' in the [[Krak\u00f3w Old Town|Old Town District]]]]\nAfter the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]] in 1795 and the ensuing [[Napoleonic Wars]], Krak\u00f3w became a [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w|free city]] under the protection of the [[Austrian Empire]]; this, however, was not to last long. In 1846, after the [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising]], the city and its university became part of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref name=\"officialhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/uniwersytet/historia|title=History|last=Waltos|first=Stanis\u0142aw|publisher=Jagiellonian University|accessdate=2010-09-28}} &nbsp;{{in lang|pl}}</ref> The Austrians were in many ways hostile to the institution and, soon after their arrival, removed many of the furnishings from the ''Collegium Maius''' ''Auditorium Maximum'' in order to convert it into a grain store. However, the threat of closure of the University was ultimately dissipated by ''[[Kaiser]]'' [[Ferdinand I of Austria]]'s decree to maintain it. By the 1870s the fortunes of the university had improved so greatly that many scholars had returned. The liquefaction of nitrogen and oxygen was successfully demonstrated by professors Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski in 1883. Thereafter the Austrian authorities took on a new role in the development of the university and provided funds for the construction of a number of new buildings, including the neo-gothic ''[[Collegium Novum]]'', which opened in 1887.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> It was, conversely, from this building that in 1918 a large painting of ''[[Kaiser]]'' [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was removed and [[Iconoclasm|destroyed]] by Polish students advocating the reestablishment of an independent Polish state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/wladyslaw-jan-pochwalski |title=W\u0142adys\u0142a Jan Pochwalski |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Stanislaw Tarnowski.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Count]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski]] was, between 1871 and 1909, twice rector of the university.]]\n\n[[File:BASA-1771K-1-1163-32-Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.jpeg|thumb|The university around 1930|left]]\nFor the 500th anniversary of the university's foundation, a monument to [[Copernicus]] was placed in the quadrangle of the ''Collegium Maius''; this statue is now to be found in the direct vicinity of the ''Collegium Novum'', outside the ''Collegium Witkowskiego'', to where it was moved in 1953.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sztuka.net/palio/html.run?_Instance=sztuka&_PageID=857&newsId=7361&_cms=newser&callingPageId=856&_CheckSum=-282421568 |title=Krak\u00f3w - Pomnik Miko\u0142aja Kopernika |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> Nevertheless, it was in the Grzeg\u00f3rzecka and the Kopernika areas that much of the university's expansion took place up to 1918; during this time the ''Collegium Medicum'' was relocated to a site just east of the centre, and was expanded with the addition of a number of modern teaching hospitals \u2013 this 'medical campus' remains to this day. By the late 1930s the number of students at the university had increased dramatically to almost six thousand. Now a major centre for education in the independent [[Republic of Poland]], the university attained government support for the purchase of building plots for new premises, as a result of which a number of residencies were built for students and professors alike. However, of all the projects begun during this era, the most important would have to be the creation of the [[Jagiellonian Library]]. The library's monumental building, construction of which began in 1931, was finally completed towards the end of the interwar period, which allowed the university's many varied literary collections to be relocated to their new home by the outbreak of war in 1939.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bj.uj.edu.pl/historia |title=Dzieje Biblioteki Jagiello\u0144skiej |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\n\nOn November 6, 1939, following the [[Nazi invasion of Poland]], 184 professors were arrested and deported to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] during an operation codenamed ''[[Sonderaktion Krakau]]'' (Special Operation Krakow).

Construction work proved slow and many of the stated goals were never achieved; it was this poor management that eventually led a number of scholars to openly criticise the government for its apparent lack of interest in educational development and disregard for the university's future. A number of new buildings, such as the ''Collegium Biologicum'', were built with funds from the legacy of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]].\n\nBy 1991 Poland had overthrown its Communist government. In that same year the Jagiellonian University successfully completed the purchase of its first building plot in [[Pychowice]], Krak\u00f3w, where, from 2000, construction of a new complex of university buildings, the so-called Third Campus, began. The new campus, officially named the '600th Anniversary Campus', was developed in conjunction with the new LifeScience Park, which is managed by the Jagiellonian Centre for Innovation, the university's research consortium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uj.edu.pl/en/rozwoj/kampus|title=Campus of the Sixcentenary|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref> Public funds earmarked for the project amounted to 946.5&nbsp;million [[zloty]]s, or 240&nbsp;million [[euro]]s.<ref name=ThirdCampus>{{cite web|url=http://www.kampus.uj.edu.pl/|title=Campus of the Sixcentenary|accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> Poland's entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004 has proved instrumental in improving the fortunes of the Jagiellonian University, which has seen huge increases in funding from both central government and European authorities, allowing it to develop new departments, research centres, and better support the work of its students and academics.\n\n===International partnerships===\nThe Jagiellonian University maintains an academic partnership with [[Heidelberg University]], Germany's oldest university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/international/profil/partneruniversitaeten.html|title=Partneruniversit\u00e4ten  \u2013 International \u2013 Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg|last=Watzke|first=Christian|website=www.uni-heidelberg.de|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> In particular, there are close ties between both Heidelberg's and Krak\u00f3w's law schools.

Last accessed on 4 May 2007.</ref> however, instead of having one central library it had several smaller branches at buildings of various departments (the largest collection was in ''[[Collegium Maius]]'', where works related to [[theology]] and [[liberal arts]] were kept). After 1775, during the reforms of [[Komisja Edukacji Narodowej]], which established the first [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education in the world, various small libraries of the University were formally centralised into one public collection in ''Collegium Maius''. During the [[partitions of Poland]], the library continued to grow thanks to the support of such people as [[Karol J\u00f3zef Teofil Estreicher]] and [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]]. Its collections were made public in 1812. Since 1932, it has been recognised as a [[legal deposit]] library, comparable to the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University Library]] or [[Trinity College Library]] in [[Dublin]], and thus has the right to receive a copy of any book issued by Polish publishers within Poland. In 1940, the library finally obtained a new building of its own, which has subsequently been expanded on two occasions, most recently in 1995\u20132001. During the [[Second World War]], library workers cooperated with [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground universities]]. Since the 1990s, the library's collection has become increasingly digitised.\n\nIn addition to the Jagiellonian Library, the university maintains a large medical library (''Biblioteka Medyczna'') and many other subject specialised libraries in its various faculties and institutes. Finally, the collections of the university libraries' collections are enriched by the presence of the university's archives, which date back to the university's own foundation and record the entire history of its development up to the present day.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w - Pomnik Miko\u0142aja Kopernika 02.JPG|thumb|upright|140px|[[Monument]] to [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] next to Jagiellonian University's ''[[Collegium Novum]]'']]\n[[File:Ignacy Lukasiewicz.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]]]]\n[[File:Bronislawmalinowski.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]]]]\n[[File:Krzysztof Penderecki 20080706.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Krzysztof Penderecki]]]]\n[[File:John Paul II Medal of Freedom 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|140px|[[Pope John Paul II]]]]\n<!---Graduation year should be placed if available--->\n* [[John Cantius|Saint John Cantius]] 1390\u20131473;
