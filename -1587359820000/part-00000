In return, the Jays responded with 20-game winner [[J. A. Happ]]. The Rangers offense, which mustered only four hits in Game 1, erupted for 13 hits in Game 2. However, three runs was all that Texas could get on the day, as their dismal hitting with runners in scoring position failed to bring home any more baserunners (the Rangers went 2-for-18 in RISP situations, and left 13 men on base). Meanwhile, Darvish gave up only five hits through five innings; however, four of those hits were home runs (a two-run home run to [[Troy Tulowitzki]] in the second after a leadoff walk, then three home runs in the fifth to [[Kevin Pillar]], [[Ezequiel Carrera]] and [[Edwin Encarnacion]]), which tied the MLB playoff record for most home runs given up by a pitcher in a single game. The Rangers scored their first run of the game on three straight one-out singles in the fourth. In the eighth, [[Francisco Liriano]] allowed a leadoff double and one out walk before [[Carlos G\u00f3mez|Carlos Gomez]]'s RBI single made it 5\u20132 Blue Jays. Liriano was then removed from the game due to taking a line-drive off his head and later be diagnosed with a concussion. Toronto manager [[John Gibbons]] called upon his closer [[Roberto Osuna]] to get a five-out save. Osuna allowed an RBI groundout to [[Ian Desmond]] before striking out [[Carlos Beltran]] to end the inning. Then he allowed a leadoff double to [[Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9]] in the bottom of the ninth to bring the tying run to the plate with no outs. The next three Rangers batters went down in order without being able to advance Beltre, giving the Jays a 2\u20130 series lead heading to Toronto for Game 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article/205295764/blue-jays-hit-4-homers-beat-rangers-in-game-2/|title=4 HRs bring Blue Jays one win away from ALCS|last1=Sullivan|first1=T.R.|last2=Chisholm|first2=Gregor|work=MLB.com|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref> With the loss the Rangers dropped to 1\u201311 in Division Series home games.\n\n===Game 3, October 9===\n{{linescore|\n|Date = Sunday, October 9, 2016\n|Time = 7:38{{nbsp}}pm ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]])\n|Location = [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n|Other = \n|Road=Texas|RoadAbr=TEX\n|R1=1|R2=0|R3=1|R4=2|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|R10=0|RR=6|RH=4|RE=1\n|Home='''Toronto'''|HomeAbr=TOR\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=2|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|H10=1|HR=7|HH=10|HE=0\n|WP=[[Roberto Osuna]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Matt Bush (baseball)|Matt Bush]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Elvis Andrus]] (1), [[Rougned Odor]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n]] (2), [[Russell Martin]] (1)\n|Attendance=49,555\n|}}\n\nLooking to eliminate the Rangers from the playoffs for the second consecutive year, the Blue Jays sent American League ERA leader [[Aaron Sanchez (baseball)|Aaron Sanchez]] to the mound in Game 3. The Rangers countered with starter [[Colby Lewis]]. The Rangers took their first lead of the series in the top of the first with a walk to [[Carlos G\u00f3mez]], a stolen base, and back-to-back groundouts. The Blue Jays, though, took that lead away immediately in the bottom of the same inning with a two-run home run by [[Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and a shot by [[Russell Martin]], making the score 3\u20131, Jays. The Rangers chipped away in the third with an [[Elvis Andrus]] home run to cut the score to 3\u20132. But the Blue Jays pulled ahead in the bottom of the same inning on an RBI double by [[Josh Donaldson]] that just stayed fair down the right field line and knocked Lewis out of the game, followed by an RBI single by Encarnaci\u00f3n off [[Tony Barnette]] to make it 5\u20132. The Rangers made it a one-run game again with a two-run home run to dead center by [[Rougned Odor]]. Sanchez would pitch into the sixth inning, leaving with two runners on and a 5\u20134 lead. [[Joe Biagini]] would allow a double to [[Mitch Moreland]] that just got out of the reach of [[Kevin Pillar]] that scored two runs and gave the Rangers a 6\u20135 lead. In the bottom of the sixth, a passed ball by [[Jonathan Lucroy]] with the bases loaded allowed [[Troy Tulowitzki]] to score the tying run. The game would go into the tenth inning tied at six. Rangers pitcher [[Matt Bush (baseball)|Matt Bush]], pitching his third inning of relief, gave up a leadoff double to Donaldson. After an intentional walk to Encarnaci\u00f3n and a [[Jos\u00e9 Bautista]] strikeout, Martin hit a ground ball to shortstop Andrus. Andrus flipped the ball to Odor, who recorded the out at second and then threw on to first base in an attempt to double up Martin. But the throw went wide of first, drawing Moreland off the base and allowing Martin to reach safely; in the meantime, Donaldson never stopped running from second base and he was able to score the winning run when he slid safely under Moreland's throw to the plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article/205550316/blue-jays-walk-off-on-rangers-and-into-alcs/|title=Blue Jays walk off to ALCS on Donaldson's dash|last1=Chisholm|first1=Gregor|last2=Sullivan|first2=T.R.|work=MLB.com|date=October 10, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref> Rangers manager [[Jeff Banister]] called for a video review to see if Encarnaci\u00f3n had interfered with the throw to second but the call was upheld to end the game and series.

In return, the Jays responded with 20-game winner [[J. A. Happ]]. The Rangers offense, which mustered only four hits in Game 1, erupted for 13 hits in Game 2. However, three runs was all that Texas could get on the day, as their dismal hitting with runners in scoring position failed to bring home any more baserunners (the Rangers went 2-for-18 in RISP situations, and left 13 men on base). Meanwhile, Darvish gave up only five hits through five innings; however, four of those hits were home runs (a two-run home run to [[Troy Tulowitzki]] in the second after a leadoff walk, then three home runs in the fifth to [[Kevin Pillar]], [[Ezequiel Carrera]] and [[Edwin Encarnacion]]), which tied the MLB playoff record for most home runs given up by a pitcher in a single game. The Rangers scored their first run of the game on three straight one-out singles in the fourth. In the eighth, [[Francisco Liriano]] allowed a leadoff double and one out walk before [[Carlos G\u00f3mez|Carlos Gomez]]'s RBI single made it 5\u20132 Blue Jays. Liriano was then removed from the game due to taking a line-drive off his head and later be diagnosed with a concussion. Toronto manager [[John Gibbons]] called upon his closer [[Roberto Osuna]] to get a five-out save. Osuna allowed an RBI groundout to [[Ian Desmond]] before striking out [[Carlos Beltran]] to end the inning. Then he allowed a leadoff double to [[Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9]] in the bottom of the ninth to bring the tying run to the plate with no outs. The next three Rangers batters went down in order without being able to advance Beltre, giving the Jays a 2\u20130 series lead heading to Toronto for Game 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article/205295764/blue-jays-hit-4-homers-beat-rangers-in-game-2/|title=4 HRs bring Blue Jays one win away from ALCS|last1=Sullivan|first1=T.R.|last2=Chisholm|first2=Gregor|work=MLB.com|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref> With the loss the Rangers dropped to 1\u201311 in Division Series home games.\n\n===Game 3, October 9===\n{{linescore|\n|Date = Sunday, October 9, 2016\n|Time = 7:38{{nbsp}}pm ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]])\n|Location = [[Rogers Centre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]\n|Other = \n|Road=Texas|RoadAbr=TEX\n|R1=1|R2=0|R3=1|R4=2|R5=0|R6=2|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|R10=0|RR=6|RH=4|RE=1\n|Home='''Toronto'''|HomeAbr=TOR\n|H1=3|H2=0|H3=2|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|H10=1|HR=7|HH=10|HE=0\n|WP=[[Roberto Osuna]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Matt Bush (baseball)|Matt Bush]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Elvis Andrus]] (1), [[Rougned Odor]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n]] (2), [[Russell Martin]] (1)\n|Attendance=49,555\n|}}\n\nLooking to eliminate the Rangers from the playoffs for the second consecutive year, the Blue Jays sent American League ERA leader [[Aaron Sanchez (baseball)|Aaron Sanchez]] to the mound in Game 3. The Rangers countered with starter [[Colby Lewis]]. The Rangers took their first lead of the series in the top of the first with a walk to [[Carlos G\u00f3mez]], a stolen base, and back-to-back groundouts. The Blue Jays, though, took that lead away immediately in the bottom of the same inning with a two-run home run by [[Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and a shot by [[Russell Martin]], making the score 3\u20131, Jays. The Rangers chipped away in the third with an [[Elvis Andrus]] home run to cut the score to 3\u20132. But the Blue Jays pulled ahead in the bottom of the same inning on an RBI double by [[Josh Donaldson]] that just stayed fair down the right field line and knocked Lewis out of the game, followed by an RBI single by Encarnaci\u00f3n off [[Tony Barnette]] to make it 5\u20132. The Rangers made it a one-run game again with a two-run home run to dead center by [[Rougned Odor]]. Sanchez would pitch into the sixth inning, leaving with two runners on and a 5\u20134 lead. [[Joe Biagini]] would allow a double to [[Mitch Moreland]] that just got out of the reach of [[Kevin Pillar]] that scored two runs and gave the Rangers a 6\u20135 lead. In the bottom of the sixth, a passed ball by [[Jonathan Lucroy]] with the bases loaded allowed [[Troy Tulowitzki]] to score the tying run. The game would go into the tenth inning tied at six. Rangers pitcher [[Matt Bush (baseball)|Matt Bush]], pitching his third inning of relief, gave up a leadoff double to Donaldson. After an intentional walk to Encarnaci\u00f3n and a [[Jos\u00e9 Bautista]] strikeout, Martin hit a ground ball to shortstop Andrus. Andrus flipped the ball to Odor, who recorded the out at second and then threw on to first base in an attempt to double up Martin. But the throw went wide of first, drawing Moreland off the base and allowing Martin to reach safely; in the meantime, Donaldson never stopped running from second base and he was able to score the winning run when he slid safely under Moreland's throw to the plate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article/205550316/blue-jays-walk-off-on-rangers-and-into-alcs/|title=Blue Jays walk off to ALCS on Donaldson's dash|last1=Chisholm|first1=Gregor|last2=Sullivan|first2=T.R.|work=MLB.com|date=October 10, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref> Rangers manager [[Jeff Banister]] called for a video review to see if Encarnaci\u00f3n had interfered with the throw to second but the call was upheld to end the game and series.

Bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] commented on the band's reunion, comparing it to \"seeing [[Mike Tyson]] fight. He probably won\u2019t bite anyone\u2019s ear off \u2014 but you\u2019re there in case he does.\"<ref name=\"blender.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1475 |title=Twilight of the Gods |accessdate=2014-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216072733/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1475 |archivedate=2005-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to vocalist [[Vince Neil]], the early stages of the band's reunion were \"kinda' strained. I hadn\u2019t talked to Tommy Lee in years. Everyone was really guarded and had their managers there. It was very strange. [[Mick Mars]] was home, I guess. Either there or the hospital.\"<ref name=\"blender.com\"/>\n\n''Red, White & Cr\u00fce'' features three new studio recordings: the album's lead single, \"[[If I Die Tomorrow]]\", co-written by [[pop punk]] band [[Simple Plan]], the second single \"[[Sick Love Song]]\" and \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\", a [[Rolling Stones]] cover. Tommy Lee does not perform on the cover of  \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\"; drumming duties were handled by [[Josh Freese]] of [[The Vandals]]. The album also features previously unreleased tracks \"Black Widow\" and the Japanese bonus track \"I'm a Liar\".\n\n''Red, White & Cr\u00fce'' is certified platinum.\n\nA video was made for \"Sick Love Song,\" though the video, mostly composed of produced concert clips, got only scarce airplay, the song found its way onto some rock-oriented radio stations.\n\nA special edition that includes a \"Greatest Video Hits\" DVD compilation was also made.\n\n==Track listing==\n'''Disc 1'''\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = [[Live Wire (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song)|Live Wire]]\n| writer1         =

music|heavy metal]] band [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], released on February 1, 2005 by [[M\u00f6tley Records]] and charted at number 6 on [[The Billboard 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4964|pure_url=yes}}|title = Allmusic (Motley Crue charts & awards)Billboard albums|publisher=}}</ref> To coincide with the album's release, the band reunited with drummer [[Tommy Lee]], who left the band in 1999. Bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] commented on the band's reunion, comparing it to \"seeing [[Mike Tyson]] fight. He probably won\u2019t bite anyone\u2019s ear off \u2014 but you\u2019re there in case he does.\"<ref name=\"blender.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1475 |title=Twilight of the Gods |accessdate=2014-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216072733/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1475 |archivedate=2005-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to vocalist [[Vince Neil]], the early stages of the band's reunion were \"kinda' strained. I hadn\u2019t talked to Tommy Lee in years. Everyone was really guarded and had their managers there. It was very strange. [[Mick Mars]] was home, I guess. Either there or the hospital.\"<ref name=\"blender.com\"/>\n\n''Red, White & Cr\u00fce'' features three new studio recordings: the album's lead single, \"[[If I Die Tomorrow]]\", co-written by [[pop punk]] band [[Simple Plan]], the second single \"[[Sick Love Song]]\" and \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\", a [[Rolling Stones]] cover. Tommy Lee does not perform on the cover of  \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\"; drumming duties were handled by [[Josh Freese]] of [[The Vandals]]. The album also features previously unreleased tracks \"Black Widow\" and the Japanese bonus track \"I'm a Liar\".\n\n''Red, White & Cr\u00fce'' is certified platinum.\n\nA video was made for \"Sick Love Song,\" though the video, mostly composed of produced concert clips, got only scarce airplay, the song found its way onto some rock-oriented radio stations.\n\nA special edition that includes a \"Greatest Video Hits\" DVD compilation was also made.\n\n==Track listing==\n'''Disc 1'''\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = [[Live Wire (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song)|Live Wire]]\n| writer1         =

There are at least eleven different dialects that show some sort of correspondence to the Mortlock Island groups. \n\n==Classification==\nMortlockese is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language currently holding a 6b language status, meaning that it is threatened with extinction. More specifically, a language is given the 6b language status when it is only used for in-person communication (i.e., not written language), with a decline in the number of speakers.<ref name=\"e19\"/> In the nuclear Micronesian languages, Mortlockese Language falls under the [[Chuukic languages|Chuukic]] category.<ref name=\"Odango\"/> One factor contributing to the present endangerment of Mortlockese are natural disasters, such as the typhoon that struck the Mortlock Islands in 1907.<ref name=\"Odango\" /> Such natural disasters kill many speakers of Mortlockese, and since the language is primarily transmitted orally, this removes many outlets for passing on the culture and language to youth.\n\n==History==\n{{citations needed|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Mortlock Islands 153.65366E 5.44213N.png|thumb|Image of Mortlock Islands taken by satellite]]The Mortlock islands, where Mortlockese is mainly spoken, is estimated to have had its first settlement around eight hundred to nine hundred years ago.<ref name=\"Odango\"/> There is evidence showing that the Mortlockese Language originated from the [[Chuuk Lagoon]] since many Mortlock natives trace their history back to the Chuuk Lagoon islands. Along with the genealogies, many clans that exist in the Mortlock islands also exist in the Chuuk Lagoon islands.<ref name=\"Odango\"/> In 1907, there was a typhoon that hit the Mortlock island Ta which caused the people there to move to [[Saipan]] and [[Pohnpei]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Now, Mortlockese Language speakers can be found not only on the Mortlock islands, but also on Saipan and Pohnpei.\n\nDocumenting the language by writing it down was uncommon; instead, stories were passed down orally, which leads to less available documented history. Children learned from their parents and the stories told by relatives. The main role of girls growing up was to help their mothers and learn household tasks. For the boys, more \u201cmasculine\u201d tasks such as fishing were promoted. Family life was important, and obedience was widely accepted by children in fear of a supernatural power punishing them. Myths and folktales told stories of religious and cultural beliefs passed down. Family is important to the Mortlock natives. Family structure is important and different rules are followed depending on the different islands. In several cases, the woman is head of the family. Sleeping arrangements may mean men in large homes separate from the women and children. Friendships are also extremely important within the Mortlockese culture. Friendship was more of a \u201cbrotherhood.\u201d It is noted that if a friendship was formed between two people, each of the other\u2019s family members became family as well.\n\nAs early as January 1874, missionaries visited the islands and began building schools to teach the natives religious ways of life. Their main efforts were to increase awareness of [[Puritanism (disambiguation)|Puritanism]]. [[Europe|European]] clothes were introduced, as well as the prohibition of drugs and alcohol. There was concern of children in school falling out of touch with their native ways. The history and traditions of the Natives was approved and a new course was updated and continued for years. According to several documents, several changes to the curriculum were made to incorporate native traditions as well as to introduce new information from the Europeans.\n\nThe most common historical belief is that the Mortlock people arrived on the islands in canoes. Over the span of the 19th century, traders continued to document their visits to the islands allowing evidence of residency.\n\nIn 1907 a typhoon hit the Mortlock islands, destroying homes, and killing hundreds.<ref name=\"Odango\" /> Unfortunately, natural disasters, war, and other changes to the islands are to blame for the little to no documentation of the Mortlock history and language. What is left is the writings of missionaries who visited the island to teach the word of God, and to translate the Mortlockese Language into biblical text. There are documents of what curriculum was taught in the schools opened, as well as the number of students and teachers present. There are also certain rules that are noted in several cases implying that words are not always what they seem. In terms of family and kinship, personal names were used when referring to family instead of terms like \u201ccousin,\u201d or \u201cgrandparent.\u201d Kinship terms categorize relatives instead of label them directly.

For example, Lukunosh Mortlockese as spoken in Pukin has four levels of diexis (near speaker, near listener, far from speaker and listener, in the minds of speaker and listener) while K\u00fatt\u00fa Mortlockese has five levels.<ref name=\"Odango\"/>\n\nIn addition to common nouns and [[proper noun]]s are [[relational noun]]s, which are further divided into three categories: oblique, locational, and partitive.<ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\nSubject markers help to interpret either anaphoric arguments or grammatical agreements. \nObject markers show the third person singular object suffix where there is an overt object. \nBoth the third person singular object suffix and the other non third person singular object suffixes act as an anaphoric agreement when there is no overt object. \n\n\n=== Noun phrases ===\nA noun phrase is at minimum a bare noun. This bare noun can then be modified by [[demonstratives]], [[Possessive determiner|possessive]], and [[Numeral classifiers|numeral]] classifiers. It is also possible to attach the stative [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|TAM]] marker /mii/ after a bare noun and then add an adjective. An example is /uu\u0283/ 'banana' turning into  /uu\u0283 mii par/ 'red banana'. The structure of noun phrases generally follow the form: (Numeral) (possessive) (noun) (possessive suffix) (demonstrative suffix) (stative) (adjective). (pg.129)<ref name=\"Odango\"/>\n\n=== Verb phrases ===\nVerb phrases follow the form (Proclitic prefix) (subject) (TAM marker) (optional adverb) (verb) (suffix) (directional suffix) (object or noun), giving Mortlockese an [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] sentence structure. <ref name=\"Odango\" /> Subject pronouns used in the sentence are followed by an aspect morpheme, with only one aspect morpheme per clause. <ref name=\"Ward\" /> The only preposition used in the Mortlockese language is /m\u025e/. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Nouns ==\nCommon or base nouns have no prefixes or suffixes and can be used with classifiers for counting. They can also be further categorized by possessive classifiers which indicate the relationship between the possessor and object as being indirect or alienable, and possessive suffixes are used to indicate direct or inalienable possession. Some nouns also indicate the specific use for the object in question, including the nature of how it is to be used by the subject in a sentence. Nouns can be modified by adjectives, demonstratives, and numeral classifiers and modified nouns will usually undergo vowel lengthening from (C)(V)(C) to (C)(V)(V)(C).\nTypes of nouns in Mortlockese include proper nouns, relational nouns (which cannot be modified and are used to indicate inalienable possession), oblique nouns, locational nouns, and partitive nouns. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Verbs ==\n\n=== Intransitive verbs ===\n[[Intransitive verbs]] in Mortlockese are described by two separate classes. The first class is \u201cunaccusatives\u201d, which are linked to adjectives and can show that the object is undergoing a process or action. The other class is \u201cunergatives,\u201d which are more like actual verbs in that they describe actions rather than a state of being. Both types of intransitive verbs have related transitive verb forms. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n=== Transitive verbs ===\n[[Transitive verbs]] require the use of direct object suffixes which reference the object of the phrase. These include prepositional verbs, which are used with a direct object suffix and are not used with causitives or reduplication to indicate different aspects. Transitive verbs in Mortlockese can be used alone or as followed by a direct object noun phrase in a clause. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Adverbs ==\nAdverbs can come before or after the verb in a sentence. Combining an adjective with the morpheme /l\u025b/ and a verb will result in a form that roughly translates to the form of an English adverb ending with \u201c-ly\u201d. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Pronouns ==\nFour types of pronouns are used in Mortlockese. The first type, independent pronouns, can be used either as the subject or direct object of a phrase or sentence. Different variations or forms may be used or preferred in the different dialects, but all of the forms are interchangeable. \nSubject proclitics are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the subject. An example of linguistic metathesis is shown in the variation of the third-person plural sunject proclitic pronoun /\u025br=/ to /r\u025b=/ where the use of either is accepted, but an individual speaker will only choose to use one form.\nDirect object suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the direct object of a phrase or sentence.\nLastly, possessive suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of possessors and the relationship between the speaker and the possessor.\nA verb can be combined with causative prefixes, transitive third-person direct object suffixes and thematic vowels (the inclusion of which depends on whether the ending of the verb is a vowel or a consonant) to create descriptive clauses that include pronouns. The different dialects will have different ways of modifying verbs and pronouns; likewise, generational differences yield different forms of word modifications. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\nIndependent pronouns are used in response to WH questions. \n== Demonstratives ==\nSingular and plural [[demonstratives]] are used to indicate proximity to the speaker or listener, and what number of objects there are. These words have the English equivalents of \u201cthis,\u201d \u201cthat,\u201d \u201chere,\u201d \u201cthere,\u201d and the like. These can also be modified to indicate other qualities of the subject, such as in recalling something from the past that is not present with the speakers at the time they choose to discuss it. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Conjunctions ==\nThe two types of [[conjunctions]] in Mortlockese are subordinators and coordinators. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n== Possessive classifiers ==\nThe [[Possessive determiner|possessive classifier]] acts as the base of the word, and indicates the relationship of the possessum noun to the possessor. The general possessive classifier in Lukunosh is [jaa-].\n\n=== Possessive suffixes ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|1SG\n| -j\n|-\n|2SG\n| -m<sup>w</sup>\n|-\n|3SG\n| -\n|-\n|1 PL.INCL\n| -\u0283\n|-\n|1 PL.EXCL\n| -mam\n|-\n|2PL\n| -mi\n|-\n|3PL\n| -r\n|-\n|CONST\n| -n\n|}\nWhen attaching possessive suffixes to consonant-final words, a vowel is placed between the final consonant and the suffix. An example is [maas] (eye, face) becoming [masan] (their eye, face). The form [masn] is phonetically possible in Mortlockese, but is deemed impossible by speakers.<ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n==Vocabulary==\nCertain words cannot be spoken in the presence of the opposite sex. This gender-restrictive vocabulary, sometimes called cookhouse speech, may only be used when speaking to people of the same gender.<ref name=\"Odango\" /> This gender-restrictive vocabulary shows an example of avoidance speech, a type of [[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorific]], in the Mortlockese Language. Mortlockese is a matrilineal society, considering the patrilineal lineage as secondary. The Mortlockese vocabulary includes terms to denote siblings and cousins of the same gender, and different terms to refer siblings and cousins of the opposite gender. Verbs can be [[Transitive verb|transitive]], [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]](unergative or unaccusitive), or semitransitive.<ref name=\"Odango\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* A [https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/32732 collection of Mortlockese recordings] are available through [[Kaipuleohone]]\n* http://unravellingmag.com/articles/kapasen-mwoshlok/\n{{Languages of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n{{Micronesian languages}}\n\n\n[[Category:Chuukic languages]]\n[[Category:Endangered Austronesian languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Federated States of Micronesia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox language\n  |name=Mortlockese\n  |altname= Mortlock, Kapsen Mwoshul\u00f3k, or Nomoi\n  |states=[[Federated States of Micronesia]]\n  |region=[[Caroline Islands]]\n  |speakers=5,900\n  |date=1989 census\n  |ref = e19\n  |familycolor=Austronesian\n  |fam2=[[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]]\n  |fam3=[[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]]\n  |fam4=[[Micronesian languages|Micronesian]]\n  |fam5=Nuclear Micronesian\n  |fam6=[[Trukic languages|Trukic]]\n  |fam7=Satawalese\u2013Mortlockese\n  |iso3=mrl\n|glotto=mort1237\n|glottorefname=Mortlockese\n}}\n'''Mortlockese''' ('''Kapsen Mwoshul\u00f3k'''), also known as Mortlock or Nomoi,<ref name=\"e19\"/> is a language that belongs to the [[Trukic languages|Chuukic group]] of  [[Micronesian languages]] in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] spoken primarily in the Mortlock Islands ([[Nomoi Islands|Nomoi or Lower Mortlock Islands]] and the [[Upper Mortlock Islands]]).<ref name=\"Odango\">Odango, Emerson. 2015.

There are at least eleven different dialects that show some sort of correspondence to the Mortlock Island groups. \n\n==Classification==\nMortlockese is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language currently holding a 6b language status, meaning that it is threatened with extinction. More specifically, a language is given the 6b language status when it is only used for in-person communication (i.e., not written language), with a decline in the number of speakers.<ref name=\"e19\"/> In the nuclear Micronesian languages, Mortlockese Language falls under the [[Chuukic languages|Chuukic]] category.<ref name=\"Odango\"/> One factor contributing to the present endangerment of Mortlockese are natural disasters, such as the typhoon that struck the Mortlock Islands in 1907.<ref name=\"Odango\" /> Such natural disasters kill many speakers of Mortlockese, and since the language is primarily transmitted orally, this removes many outlets for passing on the culture and language to youth.\n\n==History==\n{{citations needed|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Mortlock Islands 153.65366E 5.44213N.png|thumb|Image of Mortlock Islands taken by satellite]]The Mortlock islands, where Mortlockese is mainly spoken, is estimated to have had its first settlement around eight hundred to nine hundred years ago.<ref name=\"Odango\"/> There is evidence showing that the Mortlockese Language originated from the [[Chuuk Lagoon]] since many Mortlock natives trace their history back to the Chuuk Lagoon islands. Along with the genealogies, many clans that exist in the Mortlock islands also exist in the Chuuk Lagoon islands.<ref name=\"Odango\"/> In 1907, there was a typhoon that hit the Mortlock island Ta which caused the people there to move to [[Saipan]] and [[Pohnpei]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Now, Mortlockese Language speakers can be found not only on the Mortlock islands, but also on Saipan and Pohnpei.\n\nDocumenting the language by writing it down was uncommon; instead, stories were passed down orally, which leads to less available documented history. Children learned from their parents and the stories told by relatives. The main role of girls growing up was to help their mothers and learn household tasks. For the boys, more \u201cmasculine\u201d tasks such as fishing were promoted. Family life was important, and obedience was widely accepted by children in fear of a supernatural power punishing them. Myths and folktales told stories of religious and cultural beliefs passed down. Family is important to the Mortlock natives. Family structure is important and different rules are followed depending on the different islands. In several cases, the woman is head of the family. Sleeping arrangements may mean men in large homes separate from the women and children. Friendships are also extremely important within the Mortlockese culture. Friendship was more of a \u201cbrotherhood.\u201d It is noted that if a friendship was formed between two people, each of the other\u2019s family members became family as well.\n\nAs early as January 1874, missionaries visited the islands and began building schools to teach the natives religious ways of life. Their main efforts were to increase awareness of [[Puritanism (disambiguation)|Puritanism]]. [[Europe|European]] clothes were introduced, as well as the prohibition of drugs and alcohol. There was concern of children in school falling out of touch with their native ways. The history and traditions of the Natives was approved and a new course was updated and continued for years. According to several documents, several changes to the curriculum were made to incorporate native traditions as well as to introduce new information from the Europeans.\n\nThe most common historical belief is that the Mortlock people arrived on the islands in canoes. Over the span of the 19th century, traders continued to document their visits to the islands allowing evidence of residency.\n\nIn 1907 a typhoon hit the Mortlock islands, destroying homes, and killing hundreds.<ref name=\"Odango\" /> Unfortunately, natural disasters, war, and other changes to the islands are to blame for the little to no documentation of the Mortlock history and language. What is left is the writings of missionaries who visited the island to teach the word of God, and to translate the Mortlockese Language into biblical text. There are documents of what curriculum was taught in the schools opened, as well as the number of students and teachers present. There are also certain rules that are noted in several cases implying that words are not always what they seem. In terms of family and kinship, personal names were used when referring to family instead of terms like \u201ccousin,\u201d or \u201cgrandparent.\u201d Kinship terms categorize relatives instead of label them directly.

For example, Lukunosh Mortlockese as spoken in Pukin has four levels of diexis (near speaker, near listener, far from speaker and listener, in the minds of speaker and listener) while K\u00fatt\u00fa Mortlockese has five levels.<ref name=\"Odango\"/>\n\nIn addition to common nouns and [[proper noun]]s are [[relational noun]]s, which are further divided into three categories: oblique, locational, and partitive.<ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\nSubject markers help to interpret either anaphoric arguments or grammatical agreements. \nObject markers show the third person singular object suffix where there is an overt object. \nBoth the third person singular object suffix and the other non third person singular object suffixes act as an anaphoric agreement when there is no overt object. \n\n\n=== Noun phrases ===\nA noun phrase is at minimum a bare noun. This bare noun can then be modified by [[demonstratives]], [[Possessive determiner|possessive]], and [[Numeral classifiers|numeral]] classifiers. It is also possible to attach the stative [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|TAM]] marker /mii/ after a bare noun and then add an adjective. An example is /uu\u0283/ 'banana' turning into  /uu\u0283 mii par/ 'red banana'. The structure of noun phrases generally follow the form: (Numeral) (possessive) (noun) (possessive suffix) (demonstrative suffix) (stative) (adjective). (pg.129)<ref name=\"Odango\"/>\n\n=== Verb phrases ===\nVerb phrases follow the form (Proclitic prefix) (subject) (TAM marker) (optional adverb) (verb) (suffix) (directional suffix) (object or noun), giving Mortlockese an SVO sentence structure. <ref name=\"Odango\" /> Subject pronouns used in the sentence are followed by an aspect morpheme, with only one aspect morpheme per clause. <ref name=\"Ward\" /> The only preposition used in the Mortlockese language is /m\u025e/. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Nouns ==\nCommon or base nouns have no prefixes or suffixes and can be used with classifiers for counting. They can also be further categorized by possessive classifiers which indicate the relationship between the possessor and object as being indirect or alienable, and possessive suffixes are used to indicate direct or inalienable possession. Some nouns also indicate the specific use for the object in question, including the nature of how it is to be used by the subject in a sentence. Nouns can be modified by adjectives, demonstratives, and numeral classifiers and modified nouns will usually undergo vowel lengthening from (C)(V)(C) to (C)(V)(V)(C).\nTypes of nouns in Mortlockese include proper nouns, relational nouns (which cannot be modified and are used to indicate inalienable possession), oblique nouns, locational nouns, and partitive nouns. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Verbs ==\n\n=== Intransitive verbs ===\n[[Intransitive verbs]] in Mortlockese are described by two separate classes. The first class is \u201cunaccusatives\u201d, which are linked to adjectives and can show that the object is undergoing a process or action. The other class is \u201cunergatives,\u201d which are more like actual verbs in that they describe actions rather than a state of being. Both types of intransitive verbs have related transitive verb forms. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n=== Transitive verbs ===\n[[Transitive verbs]] require the use of direct object suffixes which reference the object of the phrase. These include prepositional verbs, which are used with a direct object suffix and are not used with causitives or reduplication to indicate different aspects. Transitive verbs in Mortlockese can be used alone or as followed by a direct object noun phrase in a clause. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Adverbs ==\nAdverbs can come before or after the verb in a sentence. Combining an adjective with the morpheme /l\u025b/ and a verb will result in a form that roughly translates to the form of an English adverb ending with \u201c-ly\u201d. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Pronouns ==\nFour types of pronouns are used in Mortlockese. The first type, independent pronouns, can be used either as the subject or direct object of a phrase or sentence. Different variations or forms may be used or preferred in the different dialects, but all of the forms are interchangeable. \nSubject proclitics are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the subject. An example of linguistic metathesis is shown in the variation of the third-person plural sunject proclitic pronoun /\u025br=/ to /r\u025b=/ where the use of either is accepted, but an individual speaker will only choose to use one form.\nDirect object suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the direct object of a phrase or sentence.\nLastly, possessive suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of possessors and the relationship between the speaker and the possessor.\nA verb can be combined with causative prefixes, transitive third-person direct object suffixes and thematic vowels (the inclusion of which depends on whether the ending of the verb is a vowel or a consonant) to create descriptive clauses that include pronouns. The different dialects will have different ways of modifying verbs and pronouns; likewise, generational differences yield different forms of word modifications. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\nIndependent pronouns are used in response to WH questions. \n== Demonstratives ==\nSingular and plural [[demonstratives]] are used to indicate proximity to the speaker or listener, and what number of objects there are. These words have the English equivalents of \u201cthis,\u201d \u201cthat,\u201d \u201chere,\u201d \u201cthere,\u201d and the like. These can also be modified to indicate other qualities of the subject, such as in recalling something from the past that is not present with the speakers at the time they choose to discuss it. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n== Conjunctions ==\nThe two types of [[conjunctions]] in Mortlockese are subordinators and coordinators. <ref name=\"Odango\" />\n== Possessive classifiers ==\nThe [[Possessive determiner|possessive classifier]] acts as the base of the word, and indicates the relationship of the possessum noun to the possessor. The general possessive classifier in Lukunosh is [jaa-].\n\n=== Possessive suffixes ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|1SG\n| -j\n|-\n|2SG\n| -m<sup>w</sup>\n|-\n|3SG\n| -\n|-\n|1 PL.INCL\n| -\u0283\n|-\n|1 PL.EXCL\n| -mam\n|-\n|2PL\n| -mi\n|-\n|3PL\n| -r\n|-\n|CONST\n| -n\n|}\nWhen attaching possessive suffixes to consonant-final words, a vowel is placed between the final consonant and the suffix. An example is [maas] (eye, face) becoming [masan] (their eye, face). The form [masn] is phonetically possible in Mortlockese, but is deemed impossible by speakers.<ref name=\"Odango\" />\n\n==Vocabulary==\nCertain words cannot be spoken in the presence of the opposite sex. This gender-restrictive vocabulary, sometimes called cookhouse speech, may only be used when speaking to people of the same gender.<ref name=\"Odango\" /> This gender-restrictive vocabulary shows an example of avoidance speech, a type of [[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorific]], in the Mortlockese Language. Mortlockese is a matrilineal society, considering the patrilineal lineage as secondary. The Mortlockese vocabulary includes terms to denote siblings and cousins of the same gender, and different terms to refer siblings and cousins of the opposite gender. Verbs can be [[Transitive verb|transitive]], [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]](unergative or unaccusitive), or semitransitive.<ref name=\"Odango\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* A [https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/32732 collection of Mortlockese recordings] are available through [[Kaipuleohone]]\n* http://unravellingmag.com/articles/kapasen-mwoshlok/\n{{Languages of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n{{Micronesian languages}}\n\n\n[[Category:Chuukic languages]]\n[[Category:Endangered Austronesian languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Federated States of Micronesia]]\n", "name_user": "Wiki \u00c7ento\u00e9", "label": "safe", "comment": "Linked SVO", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortlockese_language"}

Artistically, ''New Tattoo'' shows the band returning to the earlier musical style that gave them commercial success in the 1980s and early 1990s. This is the only album by the band not to feature drummer [[Tommy Lee]], who left the band a year before, and was replaced by former [[Ozzy Osbourne]] drummer [[Randy Castillo]] on the album. The songs \"[[Hell on High Heels]]\", which charted at number 13 on the [[Mainstream rock]] charts, \"New Tattoo\" and \"Treat Me Like the Dog I Am\" were released as singles for the album. The album artwork was inspired by the cover of [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'', whose title track is said to be about Dickinson's wife cheating on him with bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], as revealed in [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s biography ''[[The Dirt]]''.\n\nNone of the songs were played live again after the tour ended; With the exception of one performance of \"White Punks on Dope\" in 2005.<ref>https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/motley-crue/2005/office-depot-center-sunrise-fl-33d648b1.html</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe original line up of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, which consisted of singer [[Vince Neil]], bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], drummer [[Tommy Lee]] and guitarist [[Mick Mars]], had reunited for the ''[[Generation Swine]]'' album and tour in 1997, mainly out of pressure from their management and record company.<ref name=\"leaf\">{{cite book |last=Lee |first1=Tommy |authorlink=Tommy Lee |last2=Mars |first2=Mick |authorlink2=Mick Mars |last3=Sixx |first3=Nikki |authorlink3=Nikki Sixx |last4=Neil |first4=Vince |authorlink4=Vince Neil |title=[[The Dirt|The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band]] |editor-last=Strauss |editor-first=Neil |editor-link=Neil Strauss |location=New York City |publisher=[[ReganBooks]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0060989156 }}</ref> Even though the group had reunited, problems still existed between Lee and Neil, as Lee felt that the band had been going in a backward direction since Neil rejoined the group. Lee was also having domestic problems with his wife, model [[Pamela Anderson]], which, after an altercation following an argument, led to him serving time in jail.<ref name=\"Break\">Layne, Anni.

Lee stayed with the group for the tour of their greatest hits album, but after each show he would retreat to his portable studio and work on material for his new project.<ref name=\"leaf\"/>\n\n== Recording ==\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce teamed up with producer [[Mike Clink]] to record the album that Sixx felt should have been the successor to their 1989 album, ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''.<ref name=\"leaf\"/> With Lee out of the band, they hired Neil's longtime friend [[Randy Castillo]], who was [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s drummer for 10 years, to take his place.\n\n== Release ==\n''New Tattoo'' debuted at No. 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and slid down shortly after.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=m\u00f6tley cr\u00fce|chart=Billboard 200}} ''Billboard'' Charting History \u2013 M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]</ref> According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], the album has sold about 203,000 copies in the U.S. to date.<ref>Peters, Mitchell.

Artistically, ''New Tattoo'' shows the band returning to the earlier musical style that gave them commercial success in the 1980s and early 1990s. This is the only album by the band not to feature drummer [[Tommy Lee]], who left the band a year before, and was replaced by former [[Ozzy Osbourne]] drummer [[Randy Castillo]] on the album. The songs \"[[Hell on High Heels]]\", which charted at number 13 on the [[Mainstream rock]] charts, \"New Tattoo\" and \"Treat Me Like the Dog I Am\" were released as singles for the album. The album artwork was inspired by the cover of [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'', whose title track is said to be about Dickinson's wife cheating on him with bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], as revealed in [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s biography ''[[The Dirt]]''.\n\nNone of the songs were played live again after the tour ended; With the exception of one performance of \"White Punks on Dope\" in 2005.<ref>https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/motley-crue/2005/office-depot-center-sunrise-fl-33d648b1.html</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe original line up of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, which consisted of singer [[Vince Neil]], bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], drummer [[Tommy Lee]] and guitarist [[Mick Mars]], had reunited for the ''[[Generation Swine]]'' album and tour in 1997, mainly out of pressure from their management and record company.<ref name=\"leaf\">{{cite book |last=Lee |first1=Tommy |authorlink=Tommy Lee |last2=Mars |first2=Mick |authorlink2=Mick Mars |last3=Sixx |first3=Nikki |authorlink3=Nikki Sixx |last4=Neil |first4=Vince |authorlink4=Vince Neil |title=[[The Dirt|The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band]] |editor-last=Strauss |editor-first=Neil |editor-link=Neil Strauss |location=New York City |publisher=[[ReganBooks]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0060989156 }}</ref> Even though the group had reunited, problems still existed between Lee and Neil, as Lee felt that the band had been going in a backward direction since Neil rejoined the group. Lee was also having domestic problems with his wife, model [[Pamela Anderson]], which, after an altercation following an argument, led to him serving time in jail.<ref name=\"Break\">Layne, Anni.

April 17, 1998.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and [[Elektra Records]] severed their 17-year relationship together, with M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce gaining full ownership of its music catalog and publishing rights.<ref name=\"Break\"/> The break with Elektra allowed the group to form its own label, [[M\u00f6tley Records]], to release future projects on.<ref name=\"Break\"/>\n\nLee's legal problems forced the band to decline invitations from [[Ozzfest]] and various radio festivals,<ref name=\"Break\"/> though the band managed to record two new songs for their 1998 ''[[Greatest Hits (1998 M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album, \"Bitter Pill\" and \"Enslaved,\" which were more in vein of their 1980s output compared to their work during the 1990s.\n\nWhile Lee was in jail, he decided that he was going to leave M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and start his own project, which eventually became [[Methods of Mayhem]]. Lee stayed with the group for the tour of their greatest hits album, but after each show he would retreat to his portable studio and work on material for his new project.<ref name=\"leaf\"/>\n\n== Recording ==\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce teamed up with producer [[Mike Clink]] to record the album that Sixx felt should have been the successor to their 1989 album, ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''.<ref name=\"leaf\"/> With Lee out of the band, they hired Neil's longtime friend [[Randy Castillo]], who was [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s drummer for 10 years, to take his place.\n\n== Release ==\n''New Tattoo'' debuted at No. 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and slid down shortly after.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=m\u00f6tley cr\u00fce|chart=Billboard 200}} ''Billboard'' Charting History - M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]</ref> According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], the album has sold about 203,000 copies in the U.S. to date.<ref>Peters, Mitchell.
