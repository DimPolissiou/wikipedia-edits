The diatoms in each deposit contain different amounts of silica, depending on the age of the deposit. The species of diatom may also differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleo-environment of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species.\n\nMany deposits throughout British Columbia, Canada, such as Red Lake Earth, are from the [[Miocene]] epoch and contain a species of diatom known as ''Melosira granulata''. These diatoms are approximately 12 to 13 million years old and have a small globular shape. \nA deposit containing diatoms from this age can provide many more benefits than that of an older deposit. For example, diatoms from the [[Eocene]] age (approximately 40 to 50 million years old) are not as effective in their ability to absorb fluids because older diatoms recrystallize, their small pores becoming filled with silica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diatoms |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GeolSci/micropal/diatom.html |publisher=UCL London's Global University |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDiatomite forms by the accumulation of the [[amorphous]] silica ([[opal]], SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O) remains of dead diatoms (microscopic single-celled [[algae]]) in [[Lake|lacustrine]] or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[sediment]]s.

Additional marine deposits have been worked in [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[Algeria]] and the [[MoClay]] of Denmark. Freshwater lake deposits occur in Nevada, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[California]]. Lake deposits also occur in [[interglacial]] lakes in the eastern United States, in Canada and in Europe in Germany, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The worldwide association of diatomite deposits and [[volcanic]] deposits suggests that the availability of silica from [[volcanic ash]] may be necessary for thick diatomite deposits.<ref name=AIME/>\n\nDiatomaceous earth is sometimes found on [[desert]] surfaces. Research has shown that the erosion of diatomaceous earth in such areas (such as the [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression]] in the [[Sahara]]) is one of the most important sources of climate-affecting dust in the atmosphere.\n\nThe siliceous [[frustule]]s of [[diatom]]s accumulate in fresh and brackish wetlands and lakes. Some peats and mucks contain a sufficient abundance of frustules that they can be mined. Most of Florida's diatomaceous earths have been found in the muck of wetlands or lakes. The American Diatomite Corporation, from 1935 to 1946, refined a maximum of 145 tons per year from their processing plant near [[Clermont, Florida]]. Muck from several locations in [[Lake County, Florida]] was dried and burned ([[calcined]]) to produce the diatomaceous earth.<ref>{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Davis, Jr. |title=The Peat Deposits of Florida Their Occurrence, Development and Uses, Geological Bulletin No. 30. |publisher=Florida Geological Survey |year=1946}}</ref> It was formerly extracted from [[Lake Myvatn]] in Iceland.\n\nThe commercial deposits of diatomite are restricted to [[Tertiary]] or [[Quaternary]] periods.

This allows much safer transport and handling than nitroglycerin in its raw form. He patented this mixture as [[dynamite]] in 1867; the mixture is also called guhr dynamite.\n\n=== Filtration ===\nThe [[Celle]] engineer Wilhelm Berkefeld recognized the ability of the diatomaceous earth to filter, and he developed tubular filters (known as filter candles) fired from diatomaceous earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technomaps.veoliawatertechnologies.com/berkefeld-aquantis/en/|title=BERKEFELD\u00ae &#38; AQUANTIS Water Treatment - Veolia Water Technologies|website=technomaps.veoliawatertechnologies.com}}</ref> During the [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] in [[Hamburg]] in 1892, these [[Berkefeld filter]]s were used successfully.  \nOne form of diatomaceous earth is used as a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]] medium, especially for swimming pools.  It has a high porosity because it is composed of microscopically small, hollow particles.  Diatomaceous earth (sometimes referred to by trademarked brand names such as Celite) is used in chemistry as a filtration aid, to filter very fine particles that would otherwise pass through or clog [[filter paper]].  It is also used to filter water, particularly in the [[drinking water]] treatment process and in [[aquarium|fish tanks]], and other liquids, such as [[beer]] and [[wine]].

Damaging the layer increases the evaporation of water from their bodies, so that they dehydrate, often fatally.\n\n[[Arthropod]]s die as a result of the water pressure deficiency, based on [[Fick's law of diffusion]]. This also works against [[gastropod]]s and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat [[slug]]s. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness.\n\nThe shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the adsorption of lipids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, do work best when a particular shaped diatom is used, suggesting that lipid absorption is not the whole story. For example, in the case of slugs and snails large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo [[ecdysis]] in shedding [[cuticle]], such as [[arthropod]]s or [[nematodes]]. It also may have other effects on [[lophotrochozoan]]s, such as [[mollusk]]s or [[annelid]]s.\n\nMedical-grade diatomite has been studied for its efficacy as a [[deworming]] agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups.<ref name=\"Lartigue 2004 660\u2013674\">{{cite journal |last=Lartigue |first=E. del C. |last2=Rossanigo |first2=C.

The diatoms in each deposit contain different amounts of silica, depending on the age of the deposit. The species of diatom may also differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleo-environment of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species.\n\nMany deposits throughout British Columbia, Canada, such as Red Lake Earth, are from the [[Miocene]] epoch and contain a species of diatom known as ''Melosira granulata''. These diatoms are approximately 12 to 13 million years old and have a small globular shape. \nA deposit containing diatoms from this age can provide many more benefits than that of an older deposit. For example, diatoms from the [[Eocene]] age (approximately 40 to 50 million years old) are not as effective in their ability to absorb fluids because older diatoms recrystallize, their small pores becoming filled with silica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diatoms |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/GeolSci/micropal/diatom.html |publisher=UCL London's Global University |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\nDiatomite forms by the accumulation of the [[amorphous]] silica ([[opal]], SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7nH<sub>2</sub>O) remains of dead diatoms (microscopic single-celled [[algae]]) in [[Lake|lacustrine]] or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[sediment]]s.

Lake deposits also occur in [[interglacial]] lakes in the eastern United States, in Canada and in Europe in Germany, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The worldwide association of diatomite deposits and [[volcanic]] deposits suggests that the availability of silica from [[volcanic ash]] may be necessary for thick diatomite deposits.<ref name=AIME/>\n\nDiatomaceous earth is sometimes found on [[desert]] surfaces. Research has shown that the erosion of diatomaceous earth in such areas (such as the [[Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression]] in the [[Sahara]]) is one of the most important sources of climate-affecting dust in the atmosphere.\n\nThe siliceous [[frustule]]s of [[diatom]]s accumulate in fresh and brackish wetlands and lakes. Some peats and mucks contain a sufficient abundance of frustules that they can be mined. Most of Florida's diatomaceous earths have been found in the muck of wetlands or lakes. The American Diatomite Corporation, from 1935 to 1946, refined a maximum of 145 tons per year from their processing plant near [[Clermont, Florida]].

It can also filter [[syrup]]s, [[sugar]], and honey without removing or altering their color, taste, or nutritional properties.<ref name=\"RootRoot2005\">{{cite book|author1=Amos Ives Root|author2=Ernest Rob Root|title=The ABC And Xyz of Bee Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0PoSYNEsh0C&pg=PA387|date=March 1, 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-2427-1|page=387}}</ref>\n\n=== Abrasive ===\nThe oldest use of diatomite is as a very mild abrasive and, for this purpose, it has been used both in [[toothpaste]] and in metal [[Polishing|polishes]], as well as in some facial scrubs.\n\n=== Pest control ===\nDiatomite is of value as an [[insecticide]], because of its abrasive and physico-[[sorptivity|sorptive]] properties.<ref>{{cite conference|url= http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~fieldspg/fields/fields-de-test-2002.pdf |title= Standardized testing for diatomaceous earth |last1= Fields |first1= Paul |last2= Allen |first2= Sylvia |first3= Zlatko |last3= Korunic |first4= Alan |last4= McLaughlin |first5= Tanya |last5= Stathers |date= July 2002 |publisher= Entomological Society of Manitoba |booktitle= Proceedings of the Eighth International Working Conference of Stored-Product Protection |pages= |location= York, U.K. |id= }}</ref> The fine powder [[adsorption|adsorbs]] [[lipid]]s from the waxy outer layer of the [[exoskeleton]]s of many species of insects; this layer acts as a barrier that resists the loss of water vapour from the insect's body. Damaging the layer increases the evaporation of water from their bodies, so that they dehydrate, often fatally.\n\n[[Arthropod]]s die as a result of the water pressure deficiency, based on [[Fick's law of diffusion]]. This also works against [[gastropod]]s and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat [[slug]]s. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is very low. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness.\n\nThe shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the adsorption of lipids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, do work best when a particular shaped diatom is used, suggesting that lipid absorption is not the whole story. For example, in the case of slugs and snails large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo [[ecdysis]] in shedding [[cuticle]], such as [[arthropod]]s or [[nematodes]]. It also may have other effects on [[lophotrochozoan]]s, such as [[mollusk]]s or [[annelid]]s.\n\nMedical-grade diatomite has been studied for its efficacy as a [[deworming]] agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups.<ref name=\"Lartigue 2004 660\u2013674\">{{cite journal |last=Lartigue |first=E. del C. |last2=Rossanigo |first2=C.

Palmerston dominated British foreign policy during the period 1830 to 1865, when Britain was at the height of its imperial power. He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865. He began his parliamentary career as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]], defected to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in 1830, and became the first Prime Minister of the newly formed [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1859.\n\nPalmerston succeeded to his father's [[Irish peerage]] in 1802. He became a Tory MP in 1807 (his Irish peerage did not bar him from a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], because it did not entitle him to a seat in the [[House of Lords]]). From 1809 to 1828 he served as [[Secretary at War]], in which post he was responsible for the organisation of the finances of the army. He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827, when [[George Canning]] became Prime Minister, but, like other [[Canningites]], he resigned from office one year later.\n\nHe served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] 1830\u201334,  1835\u201341, and 1846\u201351. In this office, Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe. His belligerent actions as Foreign Secretary, some of which were highly controversial, have been considered to be prototypes of the practice of [[Interventionism (politics)|liberal interventionism]].\n\nPalmerston became [[Home Secretary]] in [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]]'s coalition government, in 1852, subsequent to the [[Peelite]] advocacy of the appointment of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] to the office of Foreign Secretary. As Home Secretary, Palmerston enacted various social reforms, although he opposed electoral reform. When public antipathy over the Government's policy in the [[Crimean War]] lost the Government popular favour, in 1855, Palmerston was the only Prime Minister who was able to sustain a majority in Parliament.  He had two periods in office, 1855\u20131858 and 1859\u20131865, before his death at the age of 80 years, a few months after victory in a [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in which he had achieved an increased majority. He remains, to date, the last Prime Minister to die in office.\n\nPalmerston masterfully controlled public opinion by stimulating [[British nationalism]], and, despite the fact that [[Queen Victoria]] and most of the political leadership distrusted him, he received and sustained the favour of the press and the populace, from whom he received the affectionate sobriquet 'Pam'. Palmerston's alleged weaknesses included mishandling of personal relations, and continual disagreements with the Queen over the royal role in determining foreign policy.<ref>Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Nineteenth Century 1814\u201380'' (1975) p 108</ref>\n\nHistorians consider Palmerston to be one of the greatest foreign secretaries, as a consequence of his handling of great crises, his commitment to the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]], which provided Britain with decisive agency in many conflicts, his analytic skills, and his commitment to British interests. His policies in relation to [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] had extensive long-lasting beneficial consequences for Britain: although the consequences of his policies toward [[France]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[United States]] were more ephemeral.\n\n==Early life: 1784\u20131806==\n[[Image:Palmerston 1802.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 18) in 1802, by [[Thomas Heaphy]]]]\nHenry John Temple was born in his family's [[Westminster]] house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd [[Viscount Palmerston]] upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the [[Peerage of Ireland]], although the 3rd [[Viscount]] would almost never visit [[Ireland]]. His father was [[Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston|The 2nd Viscount Palmerston]] (1739\u20131802), an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer, and his mother was Mary (1752\u20131805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Edward J. | year = 2008 | title = The Ancestry of Lord Palmerston | url = | journal = The Genealogist | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 62\u201377 }}</ref> From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour.

The young 3rd Lord Palmerston also inherited a vast [[country estate]] in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]]. He later built [[Classiebawn Castle]] on this estate. Palmerston went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] (1803\u20131806).<ref>{{acad|id=PLMN803HJ|name=Palmerston, Henry John (Temple), Viscount}}</ref> As a nobleman, he was entitled to take his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] without examinations, but Palmerston wished to obtain his degree through examinations.

Palmerston was thus able to serve as an MP.</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1808 Palmerston spoke in support of confidentiality in the working of diplomacy and the bombardment of Copenhagen and the capture and destruction of the Danish navy by the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: a biography'' (2011) p 57.</ref>  Denmark was neutral but [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] had recently agreed with the Russians in the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] to build a naval alliance against Britain, including using the Danish navy for invading Britain.<ref>Ridley, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> Pre-empting this, the British offered Denmark the choice of temporarily handing over its navy until the war's end or the destruction of their navy. The Danes refused to comply and so Copenhagen was bombarded. Palmerston justified the attack by peroration with reference to the ambitions of Napoleon to take control of the Danish fleet:\n\n<blockquote>it is defensible on the ground that the enormous power of France enables her to coerce the weaker state to become an enemy of England...It is the law of self-preservation that England appeals for the justification of her proceedings. It is admitted by the honourable gentleman and his supporters, that if Denmark had evidenced any hostility towards this country, then we should have been justified in measures of retaliation...Denmark coerced into hostility stands in the same position as Denmark voluntarily hostile, when the law of self-preservation comes into play...Does anyone believe that Buonaparte will be restrained by any considerations of justice from acting towards Denmark as he has done towards other countries?...England, according to that law of self-preservation which is a fundamental principle of the law of nations, is justified in securing, and therefore enforcing, from Denmark a neutrality which France would by compulsion have converted into an active hostility.<ref>George Henry Francis, ''Opinions and Policy of the Right Honourable Viscount Palmerston, G.C.B., M.P., &c. as Minister, Diplomatist, and Statesman, During More Than Forty Years of Public Life'' (1852), pp. 1\u20133.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a letter to a friend on 24 December 1807, Palmerston described the late Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] as possessing \"the palm of political prophecy\".<ref>Kenneth Bourne (ed.), ''The Letters of the Third Viscount Palmerston to Laurence and Elizabeth Sulivan. 1804\u20131863'' (London: The Royal Historical Society, 1979), p. 97.</ref> This would become a metaphor for his own career in divining the course of imperial foreign policy.\n\n==Secretary at War: 1809\u20131828==\n[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|The [[British Empire]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815]]\nPalmerston's speech was so successful that [[Spencer Perceval]], who formed his government in 1809, asked him to become [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], then a less important office than it was to become from the mid nineteenth century. Palmerston preferred the office of [[Secretary at War]], charged exclusively with the financial business of the army. Without a seat in the cabinet until 1827, he remained in the latter post for 20 years.<ref>Dick Leonard, ''Nineteenth Century British Premieres: Pitt to Roseberry'' (2008) pp 249\u201351</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 1818 a retired officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, who had a grievance about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as he walked up the stairs of the War Office. The bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies was mad, he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]).<ref>Ridley, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nAfter the suicide of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] in 1822, the Cabinet of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s Tory administration began to split along political lines. The more liberal wing of the Tory government made some ground, with [[George Canning]] becoming [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Huskisson]] advocating and applying the doctrines of free trade, and [[Catholic emancipation]] emerging as an open question. Although Palmerston was not in the Cabinet, he cordially supported the measures of Canning and his friends.\n\nUpon the retirement of Lord Liverpool in April 1827, Canning was called to be Prime Minister. The more conservative Tories, including [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], withdrew their support, and an alliance was formed between the liberal members of the late ministry and the Whigs. The post of Chancellor of the Exchequer was offered to Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was frustrated by some intrigue between the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[John Charles Herries]]. Palmerston remained Secretary at War, though he gained a seat in the cabinet for the first time. The Canning administration ended after only four months on the death of the Prime Minister, and was followed by the ministry of [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]], which barely survived the year.\n\nThe [[Canningites]] remained influential, and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] hastened to include Palmerston, Huskisson, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Charles Grant]], [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]], and [[John William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|The Earl of Dudley]] in the government he subsequently formed. However, a dispute between Wellington and Huskisson over the issue of parliamentary representation for Manchester and Birmingham led to the resignation of Huskisson and his allies, including Palmerston. In the spring of 1828, after more than twenty years continuously in office, Palmerston found himself in opposition.\n\nOn 26 February 1828 Palmerston delivered a speech in favour of Catholic Emancipation.  He felt that it was unseemly to relieve the \"imaginary grievances\" of the Dissenters from the established church while at the same time \"real afflictions pressed upon the Catholics\" of Great Britain.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1828/feb/26/repeal-of-the-test-and-corporation-acts REPEAL OF THE TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.

He had already urged Wellington into active interference in the [[Greek War of Independence]], and he had made several visits to [[Paris]], where he foresaw with great accuracy the impending overthrow of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons]]. On 1 June 1829 he made his first great speech on foreign affairs.\n{{Quote\n|text=Lord Palmerston was no orator; his language was unstudied, and his delivery somewhat embarrassed; but generally he found the words to say the right thing at the right time, and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience.\n|title=\"Lord Palmerston\" |source=\"Encyclopaedia Britannica 13th Edition\"\n}} \nAn attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] and [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.<ref>Ridley, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1830\u20131841==\nPalmerston entered the office with great energy and continued to exert his influence there for twenty years; he held it from 1830 to 1834 \u2013 his apprentice years<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 70-1</ref> - 1835 to 1841, and 1846 to 1851. Basically, Palmerston was responsible for the whole of British foreign policy from the time of the French and Belgian Revolutions of 1830 until December 1851.  His abrasive style would earn him the nickname \"Lord Pumice Stone\", and his manner of dealing with foreign governments who crossed him, especially in his later years,<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 232</ref> was the original  \"[[gunboat diplomacy]]\".<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 143-88.</ref>\n\n===Crises of 1830===\nThe [[revolutions of 1830]] gave a jolt to the settled European system that had been created in 1814\u201315. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was rent in half by the [[Belgian Revolution]],<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 20-1</ref>  the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was the scene of [[Liberal Wars|civil war]], and the [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain|Spanish]] were about [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|to place]] [[Isabella II of Spain|an infant princes]]s on the throne. [[Congress Poland|Poland]] was in arms against the [[Russian Empire]], while the northern powers (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) formed a closer alliance that seemed to threaten the peace and liberties of Europe. Polish exiles called on Britain to intervene against Russia during the [[November Uprising]] of 1830.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 149-54.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's overall policy was to safeguard British interests, maintain peace, keep the balance of power, and retain the status quo in Europe. He had no grievance against Russia and while he privately sympathized with the Polish cause, in his role as foreign minister he rejected Polish demands. With serious trouble simultaneously taking place in Belgium and Italy, and lesser issues in Greece and Portugal, he sought to de-escalate European tensions rather than aggravate them, favouring a policy of universal non-interventionism.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 72</ref>  He therefore focused chiefly on achieving a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Belgium.<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp. 148\u201354.</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n[[William I of the Netherlands]] appealed to the great powers that had placed him on the throne after the Napoleonic Wars to maintain his rights. The [[London Conference of 1830]] was called to address this question. The British solution involved the independence of Belgium, which Palmerston believed would greatly contribute to the security of Britain, but any solution was not straightforward. On the one hand, the northern powers were anxious to defend William I; on the other, many Belgian revolutionaries, like [[Charles de Brouck\u00e8re]] and [[Charles Rogier]], supported the reunion of the Belgian provinces to France, whereas Britain favoured Dutch, not French influence, on an independent state.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 20</ref>\n\nThe British policy which emerged was a close alliance with France,<ref name=\"E Halevy, 1961 p. 73\">E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 73</ref>  but one subject to the balance of power on the Continent, and in particular the preservation of Belgium independence. If the northern powers supported William I by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and Britain united in arms. If France sought to annex Belgium, it would forfeit the British alliance and find herself opposed by the whole of Europe. In the end the British policy prevailed.<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 233</ref> Although the continent had been close to war, peace was maintained on London's terms and Prince [[L\u00e9opold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg]], the widower of a British princess, was placed upon the throne of Belgium.

Their positions were under some pressure from their absolutist kinsmen, Dom [[Miguel of Portugal]] and [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]] of Spain, who were the closest males in the lines of succession. Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a quadruple alliance of the constitutional states of the West to serve as a counterpoise to the northern alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on 22 April 1834 and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain, it accomplished its objective.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 153-72.</ref>\n\nFrance had been a reluctant party to the treaty, and never executed its role in it with much zeal. [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] was accused of secretly favouring the [[Carlism|Carlists]] \u2013 the supporters of Don Carlos \u2013 and he rejected direct interference in Spain. It is probable that the hesitation of the French court on this question was one of the causes of the enduring personal hostility Palmerston showed towards the French King thereafter, though that sentiment may well have arisen earlier. Although Palmerston wrote in June 1834 that Paris was \"the pivot of my foreign policy\", the differences between the two countries grew into a constant but sterile rivalry that brought benefit to neither.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Lytton Bulwer|title=The Life of Henry John Temple Viscount Palmerston: With Selections from His Diaries and Correspondence|publisher=Richard Bentley|url=https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog|year=1871|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog/page/n174 170]}}</ref>\n\n===Balkans and Near East: defending Turkey, 1830s===\nPalmerston was greatly interested by the diplomatic questions of Eastern Europe. During the [[Greek War of Independence]] he had energetically supported the Greek cause and backed the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] that gave Greece its independence. However, from 1830 the defence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] became one of the cardinal objects of his policy. He believed in the regeneration of Turkey, as he wrote to Bulwer (Lord Dalling): \"All that we hear about the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure unadulterated nonsense.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SpLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA647|year=1911|page=647}}</ref>\n\nHis two great aims were to prevent Russia establishing itself on the [[Bosporus]] and to prevent France doing likewise on the Nile. He regarded the maintenance of the authority of the [[Sublime Porte]] as the chief barrier against both these developments.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Image:3rd Viscount Palmerston young.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 50s), c. 1830s\u20131840s.]]\nPalmerston had long maintained a suspicious and hostile attitude towards Russia, whose autocratic government offended his liberal principles and whose ever-growing size challenged the strength of the British Empire. He was angered by the 1833 [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]], a mutual assistance pact between Russia and the Ottomans, but was annoyed and hostile towards [[David Urquhart]], the creator of the [[Mission of the Vixen|Vixen affair]], running the Russian blockade of [[Circassia]] in the mid-1830s.<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 210-11.</ref> \n\nFor his part, David Urquhart considered Palmerston a \"mercenary of Russia\" and founded the \"Free Press\" magazine in London, where he constantly promoted these views. The permanent author of this magazine was Karl Marx, who stated \"from the time of Peter the Great until the Crimean war, there was a secret agreement between the London and St. Petersburg offices, and that Palmerston was a corrupt tool the Tsar policy\" <ref>Franz Mering. \"Karl Marx.

Palmerston held that \"if we can procure for it ten years of peace under the joint protection of the five Powers, and if those years are profitably employed in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, there is no reason whatever why it should not become again a respectable Power\" and challenged the metaphor that an old country, such as Turkey should be in such disrepair as would be warranted by the comparison: \"Half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Evelyn M.

However, by 1840 Muhammad Ali had occupied [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and won the [[Battle of Nezib]] against the Turkish forces. [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Lord Ponsonby]], the British ambassador at Constantinople, vehemently urged the British government to intervene. Having closer ties to the pasha than most, France refused to be a party to coercive measures against him despite having signed the note in the previous year.<ref>Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 191-98.</ref>\n\nPalmerston, irritated at France's Egyptian policy, signed the [[Convention of London (1840)|London Convention]] of 15 July 1840 in London with [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] \u2013 without the knowledge of the French government.  This measure was taken with great hesitation, and strong opposition on the part of several members of the cabinet.  Palmerston forced the measure through in part by declaring in a letter to the Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], that he would resign from the ministry if his policy were not adopted.\nThe London Convention granted Muhammad Ali hereditary rule in Egypt in return for withdrawal from Syria and Lebanon, but was rejected by the pasha.  The European powers intervened with force, and the bombardment of [[Beirut]], the fall of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and the total collapse of Muhammad Ali's power followed in rapid succession.  Palmerston's policy was triumphant, and the author of it had won a reputation as one of the most powerful statesmen of the age.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston,'' pp. 248\u201360</ref>\n\nIn September 1838, Palmerston appointed a British consul in Jerusalem, without the conventional consultation of the Board of Trade, and gave instruction to assist with the construction of an Anglican church in the city, under the prompting influences of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], a prominent [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionist]].<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year=2014 | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref>\n\n===China: First Opium War===\n{{See also|Destruction of opium at Humen}}\n[[File:Canton from the Heights.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|British bombardment of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] from the surrounding heights, May 1841]]\n\nChina restricted trade under the [[Canton System]] (a similar policy to the policies of various European countries<ref>{{cite book |last1=Peer Vries |title=State, Economy and the Great Divergence: Great Britain and China, 1680s-1850s |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1472526403 |pages=353\u2013354}}</ref> ) and permitted official diplomatic relations only to tributary countries. Palmerston saw this as an affront to his free trade principles, and demanded reform, sending [[William Napier, 9th Lord Napier|Lord Napier]] to negotiate in 1834. China refused, and interdicted the British smugglers bringing in [[History of opium in China|opium]] from India, which was banned in China. The upshot was the [[First Opium War]], 1839\u201342, which ended in the conquest of [[Zhoushan|Chusan]] by [[Henry Pottinger]]. It was later exchanged for the island of [[Hong Kong]]. Under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]], China paid an indemnity and opened five [[treaty ports]] to world trade.

This made him very popular among the ordinary people of Britain, but his passion, propensity to act through personal animosity, and imperious language made him seem dangerous and destabilising in the eyes of the queen and his more conservative colleagues in government.  Meanwhile he manipulated information and public opinion to enhance his control of his department, including controlling communications within the office and to other officials. He leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control and more publicity, all the while stirring up British nationalism.<ref>John K.

The crisis was past, but the change which took place by the substitution of [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] for [[Adolphe Thiers]] in France, and of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] for Palmerston in Britain was a fortunate event for the peace of the world. Palmerston had adopted the opinion that peace with France was not to be relied on, and indeed that war between the two countries was sooner or later inevitable. Aberdeen and Guizot inaugurated a different policy: by mutual confidence and friendly offices, they entirely succeeded in restoring the most cordial understanding between the two governments, and the irritation which Palmerston had inflamed gradually subsided. During the administration of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], Palmerston led a retired life, but he attacked with characteristic bitterness the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with the United States. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 resolved several Canadian boundary disputes with the United States, particularly the border between [[New Brunswick]] and the State of [[Maine]] and between Canada and the State of [[Minnesota]] from Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. Much as he criticised it, the treaty successfully closed the border questions with which Palmerston had long been concerned.<ref>Robert Remini, ''Daniel Webster'' (W. W. Norton and Co.: New York, 1997) pp. 538\u2013565.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's reputation as an interventionist and his unpopularity with the Queen and other grandees was such that [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] attempt in December 1845 to form a ministry failed because [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] refused to join a government in which Palmerston would direct foreign affairs. A few months later, however, the Whigs returned to power and Palmerston to the Foreign Office (July 1846). Russell replied to critics that Palmerston's policies had \"a ''tendency'' to produce war\" but that he had advanced British interests without a major conflict, if not entirely peaceably.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1846\u20131851==\nPalmerston's years as foreign secretary, 1846-1851, involve dealing with violent upheavals all over Europe \u2013 he has been dubbed \"the gunpowder minister\" by biographer David Brown.<ref>David Brown., ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 279\u2013333.</ref>\n\n===France and Spain, 1845===\n{{Main|Affair of the Spanish Marriages}}\n[[Image:Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Palmerston, c. 1845]]\nThe French government regarded the appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities. They availed themselves of a dispatch in which he had put forward the name of a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain as a justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. However little the conduct of the French government in this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is certain that it originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] and the other powers of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small loss of honourable reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ewing Ritchie|title=The life and times of viscount Palmerston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kABAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA648|year=1866|page=648}}</ref>\n\nHistorian David Brown rejects the traditional interpretation to the effect that Aberdeen had forged an entente cordiale with France in the early 1840s whereupon the belligerent Palmerston after 1846 destroyed that friendly relationship.

Palmerston sympathised openly with the revolutionary party abroad. In particular, he was a strong advocate of [[national self-determination]], and stood firmly on the side of constitutional liberties on the Continent. Despite this, he was bitterly opposed to [[Irish nationalism|Irish independence]], and deeply hostile to the [[Young Ireland]] movement.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 241-49.</ref>\n\n===Italian independence===\nNo state was regarded by him with more aversion than [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Yet, his opposition to Austria was chiefly based upon its occupation of northeastern Italy and [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|its Italian policy]]. Palmerston maintained that the existence of Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in the political views of Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been passionately awakened by the cause of [[Italian unification|Italian independence]]. He supported the Sicilians against the [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King]] of [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Naples]], and even allowed arms to be sent them from the arsenal at Woolwich. Although he had endeavoured to restrain the [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|King]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] from his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an envoy to London to request the mediation of Britain, based on a large cession of Italian territory. Palmerston rejected the terms he might have obtained for Piedmont. After a couple of years this wave of revolution was replaced by a wave of reaction.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 343-48.</ref><ref>Herbert C. F.

[[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] assumed the government of the empire with dictatorial power. In spite of what Palmerston termed his judicious bottle-holding, the movement he had encouraged and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere subdued. The British government, or at least Palmerston as its representative, was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the French republic.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 355.</ref> Even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by Palmerston's attack on Greece. When [[Lajos Kossuth]], the Hungarian democrat and leader of its constitutionalists, landed in England in 1851 to wide applause, Palmerston proposed to receive him at Broadlands, a design which was only prevented by a peremptory vote of the cabinet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Laurence Fenton|title=Palmerston and the Times: Foreign Policy, the Press and Public Opinion in Mid-Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbXpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119|year=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=119\u201320|isbn=9780857736512}}</ref>\n\n===Royal and parliamentary reaction to 1848===\nThis state of things was regarded with the utmost annoyance by the British court and by most of the British ministers. On many occasions, Palmerston had taken important steps without their knowledge, which they disapproved.  Over the [[Foreign Office]] he asserted and exercised an arbitrary dominion, which the feeble efforts of the premier could not control. The Queen and the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] did not conceal their indignation at the fact that they were held responsible for Palmerston's actions by the other Courts of Europe.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 333-58.</ref>\n\nWhen Disraeli attacked Palmerston's foreign policy, the foreign minister responded to a five-hour speech by [[Thomas Chisholm Anstey|Anstey]] with a five-hour speech of his own, the first of two great speeches in which he laid out a comprehensive defence of his foreign policy and of liberal interventionism more generally. Arguing for domestic political effect, Palmerston declaimed:\n:I hold that the real policy of England... is to be the champion of justice and right, pursuing that course with moderation and prudence, not becoming the [[Don Quixote (character)|Quixote]] of the world, but giving the weight of her moral sanction and support wherever she thinks that justice is, and whenever she thinks that wrong has been done.<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd Hilton|title=A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783-1846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDFHmqU_6SEC&pg=PR248|year=2006|page=247|isbn=9780191606823}}</ref>\n\nRussell and the Queen both hoped that the other would take the initiative and dismiss Palmerston; the Queen was dissuaded by her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who took the limits of constitutional power very seriously, and Russell by Palmerston's prestige with the people and his competence in an otherwise remarkably inept Cabinet.\n\n===Don Pacifico Affair===\n{{main|Don Pacifico Affair}}\nIn 1847 the home of [[Don Pacifico]], a Gibraltarian merchant living in Athens, Greece, was attacked by an anti-Semitic mob which included the sons of a Greek government minister. The Greek police did not intervene in the attack, despite being present.<ref>Ridley, pp. 374\u2013375.</ref> Because Don Pacifico was a British subject, the British government expressed concern. In January 1850, Palmerston took advantage of Don Pacifico's claims on the Greek government, and blockaded the port of Piraeus in the kingdom of Greece.

The House of Commons was moved by [[John Arthur Roebuck|Roebuck]] to reverse the rebuke, which it did on 29 June by a majority of 46, after having heard from Palmerston on 25 June. This was the most eloquent and powerful speech he ever delivered, wherein he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs.\n{{wikisource|Don Pacifico Speech}}\nIt was in this speech, which lasted for five hours, that Palmerston made the well known declaration that a British subject ought everywhere to be protected by the strong arm of the British government against injustice and wrong; comparing the reach of the British Empire to that of the Roman Empire, in which a Roman citizen could walk the earth unmolested by any foreign power. This was the famous ''[[Civis Romanus sum]]'' (\"I am a citizen of Rome\") speech. After this speech, Palmerston's popularity had never been greater.<ref>Ridley, pp. 387\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Crossing the Queen and resigning, 1851===\nNotwithstanding his parliamentary triumph in the Don Pacifico affair, many of his own colleagues and supporters criticized the spirit in which the foreign relations of the Crown were carried on. The Queen addressed a minute to the Prime Minister in which she recorded her dissatisfaction at the manner in which Palmerston evaded the obligation to submit his measures for the royal sanction as failing in sincerity to the Crown. This minute was communicated to Palmerston, who accepted its criticisms.<ref>Ridley, pp. 394\u2013395.</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 1851, [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] \u2013 who had been elected President of France in 1848 \u2013 carried out a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by dissolving the National Assembly and arresting the leading Republicans. Palmerston privately congratulated Napoleon on his triumph, noting that Britain's constitution was rooted in history but that France had had five revolutions since 1789, with the [[French Constitution of 1848]] being a \"day-before-yesterday tomfoolery which the scatterbrain heads of [[Armand Marrast|Marrast]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] invented for the torment and perplexity of the French nation\".<ref>Ridley, p. 398.</ref> However, the Cabinet decided that Britain must be neutral, and so Palmerston requested his officials to be diplomatic. Palmerston's widespread support among the press, educated public opinion, and ordinary Britons caused apprehension and distrust among other politicians and angered the Court. Prince Albert complained Palmerston had sent a dispatch without showing the Sovereign. Protesting innocence, Palmerston resigned.<ref>Ridley, pp. 398\u2013399.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = David | year = 2001 | title = The power of public opinion: Palmerston and the crisis of December 1851 | url = | journal = Parliamentary History | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 333\u2013358 }}</ref>\n\n==Home Secretary: 1852\u20131855==\nAfter a brief period of Conservative minority government, the [[George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] became Prime Minister in a coalition government of Whigs and Peelites (with [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]] taking the role of Foreign Secretary and Leader of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]). It was regarded as impossible for them to form a government without Palmerston, so he was made [[Home Secretary]] in December 1852. Many people considered this a curious appointment because Palmerston's expertise was so obviously in foreign affairs.<ref>Ridley, pp. 413\u2013414.</ref> There was a story that after a great wave of strikes swept Northern England, the Queen summoned Palmerston to discuss the situation. When she enquired after the latest news, Palmerston is said to have replied: \"There is no definite news, Madam, but it seems certain that the Turks have crossed the Danube\".<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 414\">Ridley, p. 414.</ref>\n\n===Social reform===\nPalmerston passed the Factory Act 1853 which removed loopholes in previous [[Factory Acts]] and outlawed all labour by young persons between 6pm and 6am.  He attempted to pass a Bill that confirmed the rights of workers to combine but this was thrown out by the House of Lords. He introduced the [[Truck Acts|Truck Act]] which stopped the practice of employers paying workmen in goods instead of money, or forcing them to purchase goods from shops owned by the employers.  In August 1853 Palmerston introduced the Smoke Abatement Act in order to combat the increasing smoke from coal fires, a problem greatly aggravated by the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\">Ridley, p. 407.</ref> He also oversaw the passage of the [[Vaccination Act 1853]] into law, which was introduced as a private member's bill, and which Palmerston persuaded the government to support.  The Act made vaccination of children compulsory for the first time.  Palmerston outlawed the burying of the dead in churches.  The right to bury the dead in churches was held by wealthy families whose ancestors had purchased the right in the past.  Palmerston opposed this practice on public health grounds and ensured that all bodies were buried in a churchyard or public cemetery.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\"/>\n\n===Penal reform===\nPalmerston reduced the period in which prisoners could be held in [[solitary confinement]] from eighteen months to nine months.<ref>Ridley, p. 408.</ref> He also ended transportation to [[Tasmania]] for prisoners by passing the Penal Servitude Act 1853, which also reduced the maximum sentences for most offences.<ref>Ridley, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Palmerston passed the Reformatory Schools Act 1854 which gave the Home Secretary powers to send juvenile prisoners to a reformatory school instead of prison. He was forced to accept an amendment which ensured that the prisoner had to have spent at least three months in jail first.<ref>Ridley, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> When in October 1854 Palmerston visited [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst]] jail and conversed with three boy inmates, he was impressed by their behaviour and ordered that they be sent to a reformatory school. He found the ventilation in the cells unsatisfactory and ordered that they be improved.<ref>Ridley, p. 410.</ref>\n\nPalmerston strongly opposed [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s plans for giving the vote to sections of the urban working-classes. When the Cabinet agreed in December 1853 to introduce a bill during the next session of Parliament in the form which Russell wanted, Palmerston resigned. However, Aberdeen told him that no definite decision on reform had been taken and persuaded Palmerston to return to the Cabinet.  The electoral Reform Bill did not pass Parliament that year.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 403-405.</ref>\n\n===Crimean War===\nPalmerston's exile from his traditional realm of the Foreign Office meant he did not have full control over British policy during the events precipitating the [[Crimean War]]. One of his biographers, [[Jasper Ridley]], argues that had he been in control of foreign policy at this time, war in the Crimea would have been avoided.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 414.</ref> Palmerston argued in Cabinet, after Russian troops concentrated on the Ottoman border in February 1853, that the Royal Navy should join the French fleet in the [[Dardanelles]] as a warning to Russia. He was overruled, however.\n\nIn May 1853 the Russians threatened to invade the principalities [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] unless the Ottoman Sultan surrendered to their demands. Palmerston argued for immediate decisive action; the Royal Navy should be sent to the Dardanelles to assist the Turkish navy and that Britain should inform Russia of the intention to go to war if it invaded the principalities. However, Aberdeen objected to all of Palmerston's proposals. After prolonged arguments, a reluctant Aberdeen agreed to send a fleet to the Dardanelles but objected to his other proposals. The Russian Emperor was annoyed by Britain's actions but it was not enough to deter him. When the British fleet arrived at the Dardanelles the weather was rough so the fleet took refuge in the outer waters of the straits. The Russians argued that this was a violation of the [[Straits Convention]] of 1841 and therefore invaded the two principalities. Palmerston thought that this was the result of British weakness and thought that if the Russians had been told that if they invaded the principalities the British and French fleets would enter the [[Bosphorus]] or the [[Black Sea]], they would have been deterred.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 415\u2013416.</ref> In Cabinet, Palmerston argued for a vigorous prosecution of the war against Russia by Britain but Aberdeen objected, as he wanted peace. Public opinion was on the side of the Turks and with Aberdeen becoming steadily unpopular, [[Lord Dudley Stuart]] in February 1854 noted, \"Wherever I go, I have heard but one opinion on the subject, and that one opinion has been pronounced in a single word, or in a single name \u2013 Palmerston.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:British General Cathcart death at Inkerman.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Battle of Inkerman]], November 1854]]\n\nOn 28 March 1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia for refusing to withdraw from the principalities. The war progressed slowly, with no gains in the Baltic and slow gains in Crimea at the long [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]].  Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos and failures, especially the mismanagement of the heroic [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. The health and living conditions of the British soldiers was notorious and the press, with correspondents in the field, made the most of it. Tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dick |last=Leonard|title=The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|url={{Google books|7Kosl75aYPAC|The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|page=98|plainurl=yes}}|year=2013|publisher=I.B.

Derby offered Palmerston the office of Secretary of State for War which he accepted under the condition that [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] remained as Foreign Secretary. Clarendon refused and so Palmerston refused Derby's offer and Derby subsequently gave up trying to form a government. The Queen sent for [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]] but he was too old to accept:  so she asked Russell; but none of his former colleagues except Palmerston wanted to serve under him. Having exhausted the possible alternatives, the Queen invited Palmerston to Buckingham Palace on 4 February 1855 to form a government.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 433-36.</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1855\u20131858==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[First premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Whig government, 1855\u20131858}}\n\nAged 70 years, 109 days, Palmerston became the oldest person in British political history to be appointed Prime Minister for the first time. As of 2020 no Prime Minister entering [[10 Downing Street]] for the first time since Palmerston has surpassed his record.\n\n===Ending the Crimean War===\n[[File:Lord Palmerston 1855.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Lord Palmerston, c. 1855 by Francis Cruikshank]]\nPalmerston took a hard line on the war; he wanted to expand the fighting, especially in the Baltic where St. Petersburg could be threatened by superior British naval power. His goal was to permanently reduce the Russian threat to Europe. Sweden and Prussia were willing to join, and Russia stood alone. However, France, which had sent far more soldiers to the war than Britain, and had suffered far more casualties, wanted the war to end, as did Austria.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010) pp 402\u2013408</ref>  In March 1855 the old Tsar died and was succeeded by his son, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who wished to make peace. However, Palmerston found the peace terms too soft on Russia and so persuaded [[Napoleon III of France]] to break off the peace negotiations until Sevastopol could be captured, putting the allies in a stronger negotiating position. In September Sevastopol finally surrendered and the allies had full control of the Black Sea theatre. Russia came to terms. On 27 February 1856 an armistice was signed and after a month's negotiations an agreement was signed at the [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Congress of Paris]]. Palmerston's demand for a demilitarised Black Sea was secured, although his wish for the Crimea to be returned to the Ottomans was not. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|peace treaty]] was signed on 30 March 1856. In April 1856 Palmerston was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]] by Victoria.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 437-53/</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Palmerston-engraving.jpg|thumb|Original engraving by D.J.

When the Chinese Commissioner [[Ye Mingchen]] refused to apologize, the British shelled his compound. The commissioner retaliated with a proclamation that called on the people of Canton to \"unite in exterminating these troublesome English villains\" and offered a $100 bounty for the head of any Englishman. The [[Thirteen Factories|British factories]] outside the city were also burned to the ground by incensed locals. Palmerston supported Parkes while in Parliament the British policy was strongly attacked on moral grounds by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[William Gladstone]]. Playing the patriotism card, Palmerston said that Cobden demonstrated \"an anti-English feeling, an abnegation of all those ties which bind men to their country and to their fellow countrymen, which I should hardly have expected from the lips of any member of this House. Everything that was English was wrong, and everything that was hostile to England was right.\"<ref name=R467>Ridley, p. 467.</ref> He went on to say that if a motion of censure was carried it would signal that the House had voted to \"abandon a large community of British subjects at the extreme end of the globe to a set of barbarians \u2013 a set of kidnapping, murdering, poisoning barbarians.\"<ref name=R467/> The censure motion was carried by a majority of sixteen and the [[1857 United Kingdom general election|election of 1857 followed]]. Palmerston's stance proved popular among a large section of the workers, the growing middle classes and the country's commercial and financial interests. With the expanded franchise, his party swept on a wave of popular feeling to a majority of 83, the largest since 1835. Cobden and [[John Bright]] lost their seats.\n\nIn China the [[Second Opium War]] (1856\u20131860) was another humiliating defeat for a Qing dynasty,<ref>J. Y. Wong, ''Deadly Dreams: Opium, Imperialism, and the Arrow War (1856\u20131860) in China'' (1998)</ref> already reeling as a result of the domestic [[Taiping Rebellion]].\n\n===Resignation===\n[[Image:Lord-Palmerston-Addressing-The-House-Of-Commons-During-The-Debates-On-The-Treaty-Of-France-In-February-1860,-1863.jpg|thumb|250px|Lord Palmerston Addressing the House of Commons During the Debates on the [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|Treaty of France]] in February 1860, as painted by [[John Phillip]] (1863)]]\nAfter the election, Palmerston passed the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]], which for the first time made it possible for courts to grant a divorce and removed divorce from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. The opponents in Parliament, who included Gladstone, were the first in British history to try to kill a bill by filibuster. Nonetheless, Palmerston was determined to get the bill through, which he did.  In June news came to Britain of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Palmerston sent Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] and reinforcements to India. Palmerston also agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown. This was enacted in the [[Government of India Act 1858]].  After the Italian republican [[Felice Orsini]] tried to assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see [[Orsini affair]]). Palmerston introduced a Conspiracy to Murder bill, which made it a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. At first reading, the Conservatives voted for it but at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 he was forced to resign.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 472-82.</ref>\n\n==Opposition: 1858\u20131859==\nThe Conservatives lacked a majority, and Russell introduced a resolution in March 1859 arguing for widening the franchise, which the Conservatives opposed but which was carried. Parliament was dissolved and [[1859 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] ensued, which the Whigs won. Palmerston rejected an offer from Disraeli to become Conservative leader, but he attended the meeting of 6 June 1859 in Willis's Rooms at St James Street, where the Liberal Party was formed. The Queen asked [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]] to form a government, but although Palmerston agreed to serve under him, Russell did not. Therefore, on 12 June the Queen asked Palmerston to become prime minister. Russell and Gladstone agreed to serve under him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Victoria |title=The Letters of Queen Victoria: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog|year=1907|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog/page/n483 439]\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1859\u20131865==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Liberal government, 1859\u20131866}}\nHistorians usually regard Palmerston, starting in 1859, as the first Liberal.<ref>David Loades, ed., '' Readers Guide to British History'' (2003) 2: 998</ref> In his last premiership Palmerston oversaw the passage of important legislation.

The MP Sir [[William Henry Gregory|William Gregory]] was told by a member of the Cabinet that \"at the beginning of each session and after each holiday, Mr Gladstone used to come in charged to the muzzle with all sorts of schemes of all sorts of reforms which were absolutely necessary in his opinion to be immediately undertaken. Palmerston used to look fixedly at the paper before him, saying nothing until there was a lull in Gladstone's outpouring. He then rapped the table and said cheerfully: 'Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business'.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 563.</ref> Palmerston told Lord Shaftesbury: \"Gladstone will soon have it all his own way and whenever he gets my place we shall have strange doings\". He told another friend that he thought Gladstone would wreck the Liberal Party and end up in a madhouse.<ref>Ridley, p. 566.</ref>\n\nWhen in May 1864 the MP [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines]] introduced a Reform Bill in the Commons, Palmerston ordered Gladstone to not commit himself and the government to any particular scheme.<ref>Philip Guedalla (ed.), ''Gladstone and Palmerston, being the Correspondence of Lord Palmerston with Mr. Gladstone 1851\u20131865'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1928), p. 279.</ref> Instead Gladstone said in his speech in the Commons that he did not see why any man should not have the vote unless he was mentally incapacitated, but added that this would not come about unless the working class showed an interest in reform. Palmerston believed that this was incitement to the working class to begin agitating for reform and told Gladstone: \"What every Man and Woman too have a Right to, is to be well governed and under just Laws, and they who propose a change ought to shew that the present organization does not accomplish those objects\".<ref>Guedalla, p. 282.</ref>\n\n[[Second Italian War of Independence|French intervention in Italy]] had created an invasion scare and Palmerston established a [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] which reported in 1860. It recommended a huge [[Palmerston Forts|programme of fortifications]] to protect the [[Royal Navy Dockyards]] and ports, which Palmerston vigorously supported. Objecting to the enormous expense, Gladstone repeatedly threatened to resign as Chancellor when the proposals were accepted. Palmerston said that he had received so many resignation letters from Gladstone that he feared that they would set fire to the chimney.<ref>Ridley, p. 564.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Lord Lyons===\nDuring the advent and occurrence of the [[American Civil War]], the British Ambassador to the United States was Palmerston's close friend and ally [[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons, 2nd Baron Lyons]]. Palmerston had first appointed Richard Lyons to the Foreign Service in 1839, and was a close friend of his father, [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons]], with whom he had vehemently advocated increased aggression in the [[Crimean War]]. Palmerston and Lyons both had similar sociopolitical sympathies: both advocated monarchy and foreign interventionism. Throughout the American Civil War, Palmerston and Richard Lyons maintained an extensive confidential correspondence. Their actions were responsible for the peaceful resolution of the [[Trent Affair]]. When Lyons resigned from the position of American Ambassador, Palmerston attempted to persuade him to return, but Lyons declined the offer.<ref name=\"Jenkins Lyons\">{{cite book|title=Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War|author=Jenkins, Brian|publisher=McGill-Queen\u2019s Press, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\nPalmerston's sympathies in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) were with the secessionist [[Confederate States of America]]. Although a professed opponent of the slave trade and [[slavery]], he held a lifelong hostility towards the United States, and believed a dissolution of the Union would weaken America, thereby enhancing British power. Additionally, the Confederacy \"would afford a valuable and extensive market for British manufactures\".<ref>Ridley, p. 552.</ref><ref>Kevin Peraino, \"Lincoln vs. Palmerston\" in Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 120\u201369.</ref>\n\nBritain issued a [[s:British proclamation of neutrality in the American Civil War|proclamation of neutrality]] at the beginning of the Civil War on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognised as a [[belligerent]] but it was too premature to recognise it as a sovereign state. The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[William Seward]], threatened to treat as hostile any country which recognised the Confederacy. Britain depended more on American corn than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain's economic interest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Paterson|author2=J.

He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but 15 months later he felt: <blockquote>\"...the American War... has manifestly ceased to have any attainable object as far as the Northerns are concerned, except to get rid of some more thousand troublesome Irish and Germans. It must be owned, however, that the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides have shown courage and endurance highly honourable to their stock.\"<ref name=R559>Ridley, p. 559.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]] in November 1861 produced public outrage in Britain and a diplomatic crisis. A U.S. Navy warship stopped the British steamer ''Trent'' and seized two Confederate envoys ''en route'' to Europe.  Palmerston called the action \"a declared and gross insult\", demanded the release of the two diplomats and ordered 3,000 troops to Canada.  In a letter to Queen Victoria on 5 December 1861 he said that if his demands were not met: <blockquote>\"Great Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon be forgotten.\"<ref name=R554>Ridley, p. 554.</ref></blockquote> In another letter to his foreign secretary, he predicted war between Britain and the Union:\n<blockquote>\"It is difficult not to come to the conclusion that the rabid hatred of England which animates the exiled Irishmen who direct almost all the Northern newspapers, will so excite the masses as to make it impossible for Lincoln and Seward to grant our demands; and we must therefore look forward to war as the probable result.\"<ref name=R554/></blockquote>\nIn fact, Irishmen did not control any major newspapers in the North, and the U.S. decided to release the prisoners rather than risk war. Palmerston was convinced the presence of troops in Canada persuaded the U.S. to acquiesce.<ref>Kenneth Bourne, \"British Preparations for War with the North, 1861\u20131862,\" ''The English Historical Review'' Vol 76 No 301 (Oct 1961) pp 600\u2013632 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/558199 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAfter President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s announcement in September 1862 that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in ninety days, the cabinet debated intervention as a humanitarian move to stop a likely race war. At the same time however there was a cabinet crisis in France over the overthrow of the Greek king and the growing Eastern Question with regard to Russia. The British Government had to determine whether the situation in North America or the containment of Russia was more urgent. The decision was to give priority to threats closer to home and to decline France's suggestion of a joint intervention in America; the threatened race war over slavery never happened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eichhorn | first1 = Niels | year = 2014 | title = The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma? | url = | journal = American Nineteenth Century History | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 287\u2013310 | doi = 10.1080/14664658.2014.959819 }}</ref> Palmerston rejected all further efforts of the Confederacy to gain British recognition.<ref name=\"R559\"/>\n[[Image:Lord Palmerston 1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carte de visite]] depicting Lord Palmerston, 1863]]\n\nThe raiding ship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], built in the British port of [[Birkenhead]], was another difficulty for Palmerston. On 29 July 1862, a law officer's report he had commissioned advised him to detain ''Alabama'', as its construction was a breach of Britain's neutrality. Palmerston ordered ''Alabama'' detained on 31 July, but it had already put to sea before the order reached Birkenhead. In her subsequent cruise, ''Alabama'' captured or destroyed many Union merchant ships, as did other raiders fitted out in Britain.  The U.S. accused Britain of complicity in the construction of the raiders.  This was the basis of the postwar [[Alabama claims|''Alabama'' claims]] for damages against Britain, which Palmerston refused to pay.  After his death, Gladstone acknowledged the U.S. claim and agreed to arbitration, paying out $15,500,000 in damages.\n\nIn the autumn of 1862, Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, opened a cabinet debate on whether Britain should intervene. Gladstone had a favourable image of the Confederacy, and indeed of slavery (his family wealth depended on slavery in the [[British West Indies|West Indies]]). He emphasized the humanitarian intervention to stop the staggering death toll, risk of a race war, and failure of the Union to achieve decisive military results, but Prime Minister Palmerston had other concerns at the same time, including a crisis connected with the overthrow of the Greek king, which put the Eastern Question in play. The Cabinet decided that the American situation was less urgent than the need to contain Russian expansion,  so it rejected Gladstone's suggestions.<ref>Niels Eichhorn, \"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 15#3 (2014) pp 287\u2013310.</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nThe [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]] wanted to annex the Danish territory of [[Schleswig]] and the German territory of [[Holstein]], whose Duke was the King of Denmark, chiefly for its port of [[Kiel]], and had an alliance with Austria for this purpose. In a speech to the Commons on 23 July 1863, Palmerston said the British government, like those of France and Russia, wished that \"the independence, the integrity, and the rights of Denmark may be maintained. We are convinced\u2014I am convinced at least\u2014that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow those rights and interfere with that independence, those who made the attempt would find in the result that it would not be Denmark alone with which they would have to contend\".<ref>Ridley, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref> Palmerston's stance derived from the traditional belief that France was the greater threat to Britain and was much stronger than Austria and Prussia.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\">Ridley, p. 571.</ref>\n\nFor five months Bismarck did nothing. However, in November the Danish government instituted a new constitution whereby Holstein was bound closer to Denmark. Schleswig had already been a part of Denmark for centuries. By the year's end, the Prussian and Austrian armies were massing on the [[River Eider]]. On 1 February 1864 the Prussian-Austrian armies [[Second Schleswig War|invaded Schleswig-Holstein]], and ten days afterwards the Danish government requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his soldiers that were placed on the borders of Prussia's Rhineland provinces. Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\"/>\n\nIn April Austria's navy was on its way to attack Copenhagen, and Palmerston saw the Austrian ambassador and informed him that Britain could not allow their navy to sail through the English Channel if their intent was to attack Denmark, and if it entered the Baltic the result would be war with Britain. The ambassador replied that the Austrian navy would not enter the Baltic and it did not do so.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\">Ridley, p. 572.</ref>\n\nPalmerston accepted Russell's suggestion that the war should be settled at a conference, but at the ensuing [[London Conference of 1864]] in May and June the Danes refused to accept their loss of Schleswig-Holstein. The armistice ended on 26 June and Prussian-Austrian troops quickly invaded more of Denmark. On 25 June the Cabinet was against going to war to save Denmark, but Russell's suggestion to send the Royal Navy to defend Copenhagen was only carried by Palmerston's vote. Palmerston, however, said the fleet could not be sent in view of the deep division in the Cabinet.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\"/>\n\nOn 27 June Palmerston gave his statement to the Commons and said Britain would not go to war with the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or that Denmark's capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a vote of censure in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP [[Jonathan Peel|General Peel]] said: \"It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England{{sic}}, uttered in the Parliament of England{{sic}}, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers?\"  Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: \"I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who say she had fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided\".<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 573-74.</ref>\n\nThe vote of censure was defeated by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston's old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran up the stairs to the Ladies' Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: \"What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at three o'clock in the morning, and eighty years of age!\"<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 574.</ref>\n\nIn a speech at his constituency at [[Tiverton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tiverton]] in August, Palmerston told his constituents:\n\n<blockquote>I am sure every Englishman who has a heart in his breast and a feeling of justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword successfully in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which it was not possible to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture\u2014not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.<ref>\u2018Lord Palmerston At Tiverton\u2019, ''The Times'' (24 August 1864), p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEuropean leaders watched in confusion, unable to settle the matter by peaceful compromise. British diplomacy was in the same state.  His biographer William Baring Pemberton noticed: \"Palmerston's failure to understand Bismarck lies at the root of his misunderstanding of the Schleswig-Holstein question, and it derived from an old man's inability to adapt himself to a changing world\".<ref>William Baring Pemberton, ''Lord Palmerston'' (Batchworth Press, 1954)  p.332</ref>  Thus Britain was unable to stop Prussia and misunderstood Bismarck's ambitions. Russian historian Vinogradov V. N. writes: \"In place of the former insight came bias in judgments and stubbornness in defending outdated views. Palmerston continued to consider Prussia as \"instrument in the hands of Austria\", its army - weak and doomed to defeat, and its public - consisting of romantically minded students and dreamy professors. And Otto von Bismarck quietly annexed to the Prussia two Duchies, and at the same time the County of Lauenburg\".<ref>Vinogradov V.N. Lord Parmerston in European diplomacy. New and recent history. 2006. N5. In Russian.</ref> Britain actually approved the first step to the emergence of the Reich, to the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|\"blood and iron\"]].\n\n===Electoral victory===\nPalmerston won another [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election in July 1865]], increasing his majority.  The leadership of Palmerston was a great electoral asset to the Liberal Party.<ref>Ridley, p. 579.</ref> He then had to deal with the outbreak of [[Fenian]] violence in Ireland. Palmerston ordered the [[Viceroy of Ireland]], [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Wodehouse]], to take measures against this, including a possible suspension of trial-by-jury and a monitoring of Americans travelling to Ireland. He believed that the [[Fenian]] agitation was caused by America. On 27 September 1865 he wrote to the Secretary for War:\n<blockquote>The American assault on Ireland under the name of Fenianism may be now held to have failed, but the snake is only scotched and not killed. It is far from impossible that the American conspirators may try and obtain in our North American provinces compensation for their defeat in Ireland.<ref>Ridley, p. 581.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe advised that more armaments be sent to Canada and more troops be sent to Ireland. During these last few weeks of his life, Palmerston pondered on developments in foreign affairs. He began thinking of a new friendship with France as \"a sort of preliminary defensive alliance\" against America and looked forward to Prussia becoming more powerful as this would balance against the growing threat from Russia.  In a letter to Russell he warned that Russia \"will in due time become a power almost as great as the old Roman Empire&nbsp;... Germany ought to be strong in order to resist Russian aggression.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 582.</ref> Palmerston's successors had a very different task-to restrain an aggressive Germany.\n\n==Death==\nPalmerston enjoyed robust health in old age,<ref>Hibbert, Christopher ''Disraeli: A Personal History'' (2004) p. 256</ref> living at [[Romsey]] in his home Foxhills, built in about 1840. On 12 October 1865 he caught a chill, and instead of retiring immediately to bed he spent an hour and a half [[Death during consensual sex#Notable cases|dawdling]]. He then had a violent fever but his condition stabilised for the next few days. However, on the night of 17 October his health worsened, and when his doctor asked him if he believed in regeneration of the world through Jesus Christ, Palmerston replied: \"Oh, surely.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\">Ridley, p. 583.</ref> His last words were, \"That's Article 98; now go on to the next.\" (He was thinking about diplomatic treaties.)<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\"/> An apocryphal version of his last words is: \"Die, my dear doctor? That is the last thing I shall do.\" He died at 10:45 am on Wednesday, 18 October 1865 two days before his eighty-first birthday. Although Palmerston wanted to be buried at [[Romsey Abbey]], the Cabinet insisted that he should have a [[state funeral]] and be buried at [[Westminster Abbey]], which he was, on 27 October 1865. He was the fourth person not of royalty to be granted a state funeral (after [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]).\n\nQueen Victoria wrote after his death that though she regretted his passing, she had never liked or respected him: \"Strange, and solemn to think of that strong, determined man, with so much worldly ambition \u2013 gone! He had often worried and distressed us, though as Pr. Minister he had behaved ''very well''.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\">Ridley, p. 584.</ref> [[Florence Nightingale]] reacted differently upon hearing of his death: \"He will be a great loss to us. Tho' he made a joke when asked to do the right thing, he always did it. No one else will be able to carry things thro' the Cabinet as he did. I shall lose a powerful protector...He was so much more in earnest than he appeared. He did not do himself justice.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\"/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his stepson [[William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple|William Cowper-Temple]] (later created [[Baron Mount Temple|The 1st Baron Mount Temple]]), whose inheritance included a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on|abbr=off}} estate in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]], on which his stepfather had commissioned the building of the incomplete [[Classiebawn Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sligoheritage.com/archirishvillage.htm|title= Profile of an Irish Village-Palmerston and the Conquest, Colonisation and Evolution of Mullaghmore, Co. Sligo|accessdate = 26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Algernon Cecil, summed up his greatness:\n: Palmerston placed his trust... in the Press which he was at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper he knew how to catch and the weight of his name and resources he brought to bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effontry that has never been excelled.<ref>Algernon Cecil, ''British Foreign Secretaries, 1807\u20131916'' (1927) p 139</ref>\n\nPalmerston has traditionally been viewed as \"a Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad\".<ref>Ridley, p. 587.</ref> He believed that the British constitution as secured by the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 was the best which human hands had made, with a constitutional monarchy subject to the laws of the land but retaining some political power. He supported the rule of law and opposed further democratisation after the [[Reform Act 1832]]. He wished to see this liberal system of a mixed constitution in-between the two extremes of absolute monarchy and republican democracy replace the absolute monarchies on the Continent.<ref>Ridley, p. 588.</ref> More recently some historians have seen his domestic policies as Prime Minister as not merely liberal but genuinely progressive by the standards of his era.<ref>David Steele, ''Palmerston and Liberalism, 1855\u20131865'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991).</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Capture of the King of Delhi by Captain Hodson\".jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Palmerston agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown.]]\nHowever, it is in foreign affairs that Palmerston is chiefly remembered. Palmerston's principal aim in foreign policy was to advance the national interests of England.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\"/> Palmerston is famous for his patriotism. [[Lord John Russell]] said that \"his heart always beat for the honour of England\".<ref>''The Times'' (10 November 1865), p. 7.</ref> Palmerston believed it was in Britain's interests that liberal governments be established on the Continent. He also practised brinkmanship and bluff in that he was prepared to threaten war to achieve Britain's interests.<ref>Ridely, p. 589.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's foreign policy achievements were very short-term. The peace conditions of the Congress of Paris collapsed with the defeat of France in the war with Prussia in 1870-71. The European balance was upset with the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia in 1871.\n\nWhen in 1886 [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] became Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's government, [[John Bright]] asked him if he had read about Palmerston's policies as Foreign Secretary. Rosebery replied that he had. \"Then\", said Bright, \"you know what to avoid. Do the exact opposite of what he did. His administration at the Foreign Office was one long crime.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 591.</ref> The [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]] said of Palmerston in 1866: \"He loved his country and his country loved him. He lived for her honour, and she will cherish his memory.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Edinburgh Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miQ4AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA275|year=1866|page=275}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Gladstone recounted a story of when \"a Frenchman, thinking to be highly complimentary, said to Palmerston: 'If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman'; to which Pam coolly replied: 'If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\">Ridley, p. 589.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] campaigned for rearmament in the 1930s, he was compared to Palmerston in warning the nation to look to its defences.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Winston Churchill. The Wilderness Years'' (London: Book Club Associates, 1981), pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> The policy of [[appeasement]] led General [[Jan Smuts]] to write in 1936 that \"we are afraid of our shadows. I sometimes long for a ruffian like Palmerston or any man who would be more than a string of platitudes and apologies.\"<ref>W. K. Hancock, ''Smuts. Volume II: The Fields of Force. 1919\u20131950'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 281.</ref>\n\nHe was also an avowed [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] whose attempts to abolish the slave trade was one of the most consistent elements of his foreign policy. His opposition to the slave trade created tensions with South American countries and the United States over his insistence that the [[Royal Navy]] had the right to search the vessels of any country if they suspected the vessels were being used in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].\n\nHistorian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] has summarised his career by emphasising the paradoxes:\n:For twenty years junior minister in a Tory government, he became the most successful of Whig Foreign Secretaries; though always a Conservative, he ended his life by presiding over the transition from Whiggism to Liberalism. He was the exponent of British strength, yet was driven from office for truckling to a foreign despot; he preached the Balance of Power, yet helped to inaugurate the policy of isolation and of British withdrawal from Europe. Irresponsible and flippant, he became the first hero of the serious middle-class electorate. He reached high office solely through an irregular family connection; he retained it through skilful use of the press\u2014the only Prime Minister to become an accomplished leader-writer.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, \"Lord Palmerston,\" ''History Today'' Jan 1991, Vol. 41#1 p 1</ref>\n\nPalmerston is also remembered for his light-hearted approach to government. He is once said to have claimed of a particularly intractable problem relating to [[Schleswig-Holstein question|Schleswig-Holstein]], that only three people had ever understood the problem: one was [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], who was dead; the second was a German professor, who had gone insane; and the third was himself, who had forgotten it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Douglas|last1=Hurd|author1-link=Douglas Hurd|title=Choose Your Weapons: The British Foreign Secretary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpBc5JZsd5gC&pg=RA1-PR33#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-85851-5|page=33}}</ref>\n\n''The Life of Lord Palmerston up to 1847'' was written by Lord Dalling ([[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Sir H.

The whole work was reissued in a revised and slightly abridged form by Ashley in 2 volumes in 1879, with the title ''The Life and Correspondence of Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston''; the letters are judiciously curtailed, but unfortunately without indicating where the excisions occur; the appendices of the original work are omitted, but much fresh matter is added, and this edition is undoubtedly the standard biography.<ref>Stanley Lane-Poole, '[[s:Temple, Henry John (DNB00)|Temple, Henry John]]', ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885\u20131900, Volume 56''.</ref>\n\n===Places named===\n[[File:Palmerston - geograph.org.uk - 259077.jpg|thumb|right|Palmerston's Memorial in Southampton]]\n*The Town of [[Palmerston, Ontario|Palmerston]] located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada was founded and named after Lord Palmerston in 1875.

{{postnominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=100%|KG|GCB|PC|FRS}} (20 October 1784 \u2013 18 October 1865) was a [[British people|British]] statesman who served twice as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the mid-19th century. Palmerston dominated British foreign policy during the period 1830 to 1865, when Britain was at the height of its imperial power. He held office almost continuously from 1807 until his death in 1865. He began his parliamentary career as a [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]], defected to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in 1830, and became the first Prime Minister of the newly formed [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in 1859.\n\nPalmerston succeeded to his father's [[Irish peerage]] in 1802. He became a Tory MP in 1807 (his Irish peerage did not bar him from a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], because it did not entitle him to a seat in the [[House of Lords]]). From 1809 to 1828 he served as [[Secretary at War]], in which post he was responsible for the organisation of the finances of the army. He first attained Cabinet rank in 1827, when [[George Canning]] became Prime Minister, but, like other [[Canningites]], he resigned from office one year later.\n\nHe served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] 1830\u201334,  1835\u201341, and 1846\u201351. In this office, Palmerston responded effectively to a series of conflicts in Europe. His belligerent actions as Foreign Secretary, some of which were highly controversial, have been considered to be prototypes of the practice of [[Interventionism (politics)|liberal interventionism]].\n\nPalmerston became [[Home Secretary]] in [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]]'s coalition government, in 1852, subsequent to the [[Peelite]] advocacy of the appointment of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] to the office of Foreign Secretary. As Home Secretary, Palmerston enacted various social reforms, although he opposed electoral reform. When public antipathy over the Government's policy in the [[Crimean War]] lost the Government popular favour, in 1855, Palmerston was the only Prime Minister who was able to sustain a majority in Parliament.  He had two periods in office, 1855\u20131858 and 1859\u20131865, before his death at the age of 80 years, a few months after victory in a [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in which he had achieved an increased majority. He remains, to date, the last Prime Minister to die in office.\n\nPalmerston masterfully controlled public opinion by stimulating [[British nationalism]], and, despite the fact that [[Queen Victoria]] and most of the political leadership distrusted him, he received and sustained the favour of the press and the populace, from whom he received the affectionate sobriquet 'Pam'. Palmerston's alleged weaknesses included mishandling of personal relations, and continual disagreements with the Queen over the royal role in determining foreign policy.<ref>Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Nineteenth Century 1814\u201380'' (1975) p 108</ref>\n\nHistorians consider Palmerston to be one of the greatest foreign secretaries, as a consequence of his handling of great crises, his commitment to the [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]], which provided Britain with decisive agency in many conflicts, his analytic skills, and his commitment to British interests. His policies in relation to [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] had extensive long-lasting beneficial consequences for Britain: although the consequences of his policies toward [[France]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[United States]] were more ephemeral.\n\n==Early life: 1784\u20131806==\n[[Image:Palmerston 1802.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 18) in 1802, by [[Thomas Heaphy]]]]\nHenry John Temple was born in his family's [[Westminster]] house to the Irish branch of the Temple family on 20 October 1784. Henry was to become The 3rd [[Viscount Palmerston]] upon his father's death in 1802. His family derived their title from the [[Peerage of Ireland]], although the 3rd [[Viscount]] would almost never visit [[Ireland]]. His father was [[Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston|The 2nd Viscount Palmerston]] (1739\u20131802), an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] peer, and his mother was Mary (1752\u20131805), a daughter of Benjamin Mee, a London merchant.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Edward J. | year = 2008 | title = The Ancestry of Lord Palmerston | url = | journal = The Genealogist | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 62\u201377 }}</ref> From 1792 to 1794, the young future Lord Palmerston accompanied his family on a long Continental tour.

[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Augustus Clifford|Sir Augustus Clifford]], 1st [[Baronet|Bt.]], was a [[fagging|fag]] to Palmerston, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]] and [[John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough|Viscount Duncannon]] and later remembered Palmerston as by far the most merciful of the three.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 10\">Ridley, p. 10.</ref> Palmerston was often engaged in school fights and fellow Old Harrovians remembered Palmerston as someone who stood up to bullies twice his size.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 10\"/> Palmerston's father took him to the House of Commons in 1799, where young Palmerston shook hands with the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]].<ref>Ridley, p. 12.</ref>\n\nPalmerston was then at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1800\u20131803), where he learnt political economy from [[Dugald Stewart]], a friend of the Scottish philosophers [[Adam Ferguson]] and [[Adam Smith]].<ref>Ridley, p. 14.</ref> Palmerston later described his time at Edinburgh as producing \"whatever useful knowledge and habits of mind I possess\".<ref name=\"ODNB\">David Steele, \u2018[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27112 Temple,  Henry John, third Viscount Palmerston  (1784\u20131865)]\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press,  2004; online edn, May 2009, accessed 11 December 2010.</ref> [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]] wrote to Palmerston's parents that young Palmerston was well-mannered and charming.

Indeed, I cannot say that I have ever seen a more faultless character at this time of life, or one possessed of more amiable dispositions.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 15.</ref>\n\nPalmerston succeeded his father to the title of [[Viscount Palmerston]] on 17 April 1802, before he had turned 18. The young 3rd Lord Palmerston also inherited a vast [[country estate]] in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]]. He later built [[Classiebawn Castle]] on this estate. Palmerston went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] (1803\u20131806).<ref>{{acad|id=PLMN803HJ|name=Palmerston, Henry John (Temple), Viscount}}</ref> As a nobleman, he was entitled to take his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] without examinations, but Palmerston wished to obtain his degree through examinations. This was declined, although he was allowed to take the separate College examinations, where he obtained first-class honours.<ref>Ridley, p. 18.</ref>\n\nAfter war was declared on France in 1803, Palmerston joined the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803\u20131805|Volunteers]] mustered to oppose a [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|French invasion]], being one of the three officers in the unit for St John's College. He was also appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commander of the Romsey Volunteers.<ref>Ridley, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\n==Early political career: 1806\u20131809==\n[[File:Shield of arms of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, KG, GCB, PC, FRS.png|thumb|upright|Shield of arms of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel.]]\nIn February 1806 Palmerston was defeated in the election for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge constituency]].<ref>Ridley, pp. 19\u201322.</ref> In [[1806 United Kingdom general election|November]] he was elected for [[Horsham (UK Parliament constituency)|Horsham]] but was unseated in January 1807, when the Whig majority in the Commons voted for a petition to unseat him.<ref>Ridley, pp. 24\u201326.</ref>\n\nDue to the patronage of [[Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester|Lord Chichester]] and [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|Lord Malmesbury]], he was given the post of Junior Lord of the [[Admiralty]] in the ministry of the [[William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]].<ref>Ridley, p. 27.</ref> Palmerston stood again for the Cambridge seat in [[1807 United Kingdom general election|May]] but he lost by three votes after he advised his supporters to vote for the other Tory candidate in the two-member constituency so as to ensure a Tory was elected.<ref>Ridley, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nPalmerston entered Parliament as Tory MP for the [[pocket borough]] of [[Newport (Isle of Wight) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]] on the Isle of Wight in June 1807.<ref name=\"note\">Although peers of [[Peerage of England|England]], [[Peerage of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Peerage of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] sat in the House of Lords and were not able to sit as Members of Parliament in the House of Commons, the Viscountcy of Palmerston was in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] which did not automatically grant the right to sit in the Lords. Palmerston was thus able to serve as an MP.</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 1808 Palmerston spoke in support of confidentiality in the working of diplomacy and the bombardment of Copenhagen and the capture and destruction of the Danish navy by the Royal Navy in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]].<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: a biography'' (2011) p 57.</ref>  Denmark was neutral but [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] had recently agreed with the Russians in the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] to build a naval alliance against Britain, including using the Danish navy for invading Britain.<ref>Ridley, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> Pre-empting this, the British offered Denmark the choice of temporarily handing over its navy until the war's end or the destruction of their navy. The Danes refused to comply and so Copenhagen was bombarded. Palmerston justified the attack by peroration with reference to the ambitions of Napoleon to take control of the Danish fleet:\n\n<blockquote>it is defensible on the ground that the enormous power of France enables her to coerce the weaker state to become an enemy of England...It is the law of self-preservation that England appeals for the justification of her proceedings. It is admitted by the honourable gentleman and his supporters, that if Denmark had evidenced any hostility towards this country, then we should have been justified in measures of retaliation...Denmark coerced into hostility stands in the same position as Denmark voluntarily hostile, when the law of self-preservation comes into play...Does anyone believe that Buonaparte will be restrained by any considerations of justice from acting towards Denmark as he has done towards other countries?...England, according to that law of self-preservation which is a fundamental principle of the law of nations, is justified in securing, and therefore enforcing, from Denmark a neutrality which France would by compulsion have converted into an active hostility.<ref>George Henry Francis, ''Opinions and Policy of the Right Honourable Viscount Palmerston, G.C.B., M.P., &c. as Minister, Diplomatist, and Statesman, During More Than Forty Years of Public Life'' (1852), pp. 1\u20133.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a letter to a friend on 24 December 1807, Palmerston described the late Whig MP [[Edmund Burke]] as possessing \"the palm of political prophecy\".<ref>Kenneth Bourne (ed.), ''The Letters of the Third Viscount Palmerston to Laurence and Elizabeth Sulivan. 1804\u20131863'' (London: The Royal Historical Society, 1979), p. 97.</ref> This would become a metaphor for his own career in divining the course of imperial foreign policy.\n\n==Secretary at War: 1809\u20131828==\n[[File:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|The [[British Empire]] at the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815]]\nPalmerston's speech was so successful that [[Spencer Perceval]], who formed his government in 1809, asked him to become [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], then a less important office than it was to become from the mid nineteenth century. Palmerston preferred the office of [[Secretary at War]], charged exclusively with the financial business of the army. Without a seat in the cabinet until 1827, he remained in the latter post for 20 years.<ref>Dick Leonard, ''Nineteenth Century British Premieres: Pitt to Roseberry'' (2008) pp 249\u201351</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 1818 a retired officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, who had a grievance about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as he walked up the stairs of the War Office. The bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies was mad, he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]).<ref>Ridley, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nAfter the suicide of [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] in 1822, the Cabinet of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]'s Tory administration began to split along political lines. The more liberal wing of the Tory government made some ground, with [[George Canning]] becoming [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Huskisson]] advocating and applying the doctrines of free trade, and [[Catholic emancipation]] emerging as an open question. Although Palmerston was not in the Cabinet, he cordially supported the measures of Canning and his friends.\n\nUpon the retirement of Lord Liverpool in April 1827, Canning was called to be Prime Minister. The more conservative Tories, including [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], withdrew their support, and an alliance was formed between the liberal members of the late ministry and the Whigs. The post of Chancellor of the Exchequer was offered to Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was frustrated by some intrigue between the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King]] and [[John Charles Herries]]. Palmerston remained Secretary at War, though he gained a seat in the cabinet for the first time. The Canning administration ended after only four months on the death of the Prime Minister, and was followed by the ministry of [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]], which barely survived the year.\n\nThe [[Canningites]] remained influential, and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] hastened to include Palmerston, Huskisson, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Charles Grant]], [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|William Lamb]], and [[John William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|The Earl of Dudley]] in the government he subsequently formed. However, a dispute between Wellington and Huskisson over the issue of parliamentary representation for Manchester and Birmingham led to the resignation of Huskisson and his allies, including Palmerston. In the spring of 1828, after more than twenty years continuously in office, Palmerston found himself in opposition.\n\nOn 26 February 1828 Palmerston delivered a speech in favour of Catholic Emancipation.  He felt that it was unseemly to relieve the \"imaginary grievances\" of the Dissenters from the established church while at the same time \"real afflictions pressed upon the Catholics\" of Great Britain.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1828/feb/26/repeal-of-the-test-and-corporation-acts REPEAL OF THE TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.

He had already urged Wellington into active interference in the [[Greek War of Independence]], and he had made several visits to [[Paris]], where he foresaw with great accuracy the impending overthrow of the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbons]]. On 1 June 1829 he made his first great speech on foreign affairs.\n{{Quote\n|text=Lord Palmerston was no orator; his language was unstudied, and his delivery somewhat embarrassed; but generally he found the words to say the right thing at the right time, and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience.\n|title=\"Lord Palmerston\" |source=\"Encyclopaedia Britannica 13th Edition\"\n}} \nAn attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] and [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]], two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.<ref>Ridley, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1830\u20131841==\nPalmerston entered the office with great energy and continued to exert his influence there for twenty years; he held it from 1830 to 1834 \u2013 his apprentice years<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 70-1</ref> - 1835 to 1841, and 1846 to 1851. Basically, Palmerston was responsible for the whole of British foreign policy from the time of the French and Belgian Revolutions of 1830 until December 1851.  His abrasive style would earn him the nickname \"Lord Pumice Stone\", and his manner of dealing with foreign governments who crossed him, especially in his later years,<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 232</ref> was the original  \"[[gunboat diplomacy]]\".<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 143-88.</ref>\n\n===Crises of 1830===\nThe [[revolutions of 1830]] gave a jolt to the settled European system that had been created in 1814\u201315. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was rent in half by the [[Belgian Revolution]],<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 20-1</ref>  the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was the scene of [[Liberal Wars|civil war]], and the [[Mid-nineteenth century Spain|Spanish]] were about [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|to place]] [[Isabella II of Spain|an infant princes]]s on the throne. [[Congress Poland|Poland]] was in arms against the [[Russian Empire]], while the northern powers (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) formed a closer alliance that seemed to threaten the peace and liberties of Europe. Polish exiles called on Britain to intervene against Russia during the [[November Uprising]] of 1830.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 149-54.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's overall policy was to safeguard British interests, maintain peace, keep the balance of power, and retain the status quo in Europe. He had no grievance against Russia and while he privately sympathized with the Polish cause, in his role as foreign minister he rejected Polish demands. With serious trouble simultaneously taking place in Belgium and Italy, and lesser issues in Greece and Portugal, he sought to de-escalate European tensions rather than aggravate them, favouring a policy of universal non-interventionism.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 72</ref>  He therefore focused chiefly on achieving a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Belgium.<ref>David Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp. 148\u201354.</ref>\n\n===Belgium===\n[[William I of the Netherlands]] appealed to the great powers that had placed him on the throne after the Napoleonic Wars to maintain his rights. The [[London Conference of 1830]] was called to address this question. The British solution involved the independence of Belgium, which Palmerston believed would greatly contribute to the security of Britain, but any solution was not straightforward. On the one hand, the northern powers were anxious to defend William I; on the other, many Belgian revolutionaries, like [[Charles de Brouck\u00e8re]] and [[Charles Rogier]], supported the reunion of the Belgian provinces to France, whereas Britain favoured Dutch, not French influence, on an independent state.<ref>E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 20</ref>\n\nThe British policy which emerged was a close alliance with France,<ref name=\"E Halevy, 1961 p. 73\">E Halevy, ''The Triumph of Reform'' (London 1961) p. 73</ref>  but one subject to the balance of power on the Continent, and in particular the preservation of Belgium independence. If the northern powers supported William I by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and Britain united in arms. If France sought to annex Belgium, it would forfeit the British alliance and find herself opposed by the whole of Europe. In the end the British policy prevailed.<ref>G M Trevelyan, ''British History in the 19th Century'' (London 1922) p. 233</ref> Although the continent had been close to war, peace was maintained on London's terms and Prince [[L\u00e9opold I of Belgium|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg]], the widower of a British princess, was placed upon the throne of Belgium.

Their positions were under some pressure from their absolutist kinsmen, Dom [[Miguel of Portugal]] and [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]] of Spain, who were the closest males in the lines of succession. Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a quadruple alliance of the constitutional states of the West to serve as a counterpoise to the northern alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on 22 April 1834 and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain, it accomplished its objective.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 153-72.</ref>\n\nFrance had been a reluctant party to the treaty, and never executed its role in it with much zeal. [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] was accused of secretly favouring the [[Carlism|Carlists]] \u2013 the supporters of Don Carlos \u2013 and he rejected direct interference in Spain. It is probable that the hesitation of the French court on this question was one of the causes of the enduring personal hostility Palmerston showed towards the French King thereafter, though that sentiment may well have arisen earlier. Although Palmerston wrote in June 1834 that Paris was \"the pivot of my foreign policy\", the differences between the two countries grew into a constant but sterile rivalry that brought benefit to neither.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Lytton Bulwer|title=The Life of Henry John Temple Viscount Palmerston: With Selections from His Diaries and Correspondence|publisher=Richard Bentley|url=https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog|year=1871|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifehenryjohnte02bulwgoog/page/n174 170]}}</ref>\n\n===Balkans and Near East: defending Turkey, 1830s===\nPalmerston was greatly interested by the diplomatic questions of Eastern Europe. During the [[Greek War of Independence]] he had energetically supported the Greek cause and backed the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] that gave Greece its independence. However, from 1830 the defence of the [[Ottoman Empire]] became one of the cardinal objects of his policy. He believed in the regeneration of Turkey, as he wrote to Bulwer (Lord Dalling): \"All that we hear about the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure unadulterated nonsense.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SpLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA647|year=1911|page=647}}</ref>\n\nHis two great aims were to prevent Russia establishing itself on the [[Bosporus]] and to prevent France doing likewise on the Nile. He regarded the maintenance of the authority of the [[Sublime Porte]] as the chief barrier against both these developments.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Image:3rd Viscount Palmerston young.jpg|thumb|Palmerston (age 50s), c. 1830s\u20131840s.]]\nPalmerston had long maintained a suspicious and hostile attitude towards Russia, whose autocratic government offended his liberal principles and whose ever-growing size challenged the strength of the British Empire. He was angered by the 1833 [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]], a mutual assistance pact between Russia and the Ottomans, but was annoyed and hostile towards [[David Urquhart]], the creator of the [[Mission of the Vixen|Vixen affair]], running the Russian blockade of [[Circassia]] in the mid-1830s.<ref>Brown, ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 210-11.</ref> \n\nFor his part, David Urquhart considered Palmerston a \"mercenary of Russia\" and founded the \"Free Press\" magazine in London, where he constantly promoted these views. The permanent author of this magazine was Karl Marx, who stated \"from the time of Peter the Great until the Crimean war, there was a secret agreement between the London and St. Petersburg offices, and that Palmerston was a corrupt tool the Tsar policy\" <ref>Franz Mering. \"Karl Marx.

Palmerston held that \"if we can procure for it ten years of peace under the joint protection of the five Powers, and if those years are profitably employed in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, there is no reason whatever why it should not become again a respectable Power\" and challenged the metaphor that an old country, such as Turkey should be in such disrepair as would be warranted by the comparison: \"Half the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Anthony Evelyn M.

However, by 1840 Muhammad Ali had occupied [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and won the [[Battle of Nezib]] against the Turkish forces. [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Lord Ponsonby]], the British ambassador at Constantinople, vehemently urged the British government to intervene. Having closer ties to the pasha than most, France refused to be a party to coercive measures against him despite having signed the note in the previous year.<ref>Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 191-98.</ref>\n\nPalmerston, irritated at France's Egyptian policy, signed the [[Convention of London (1840)|London Convention]] of 15 July 1840 in London with [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] \u2013 without the knowledge of the French government.  This measure was taken with great hesitation, and strong opposition on the part of several members of the cabinet.  Palmerston forced the measure through in part by declaring in a letter to the Prime Minister, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], that he would resign from the ministry if his policy were not adopted.\nThe London Convention granted Muhammad Ali hereditary rule in Egypt in return for withdrawal from Syria and Lebanon, but was rejected by the pasha.  The European powers intervened with force, and the bombardment of [[Beirut]], the fall of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and the total collapse of Muhammad Ali's power followed in rapid succession.  Palmerston's policy was triumphant, and the author of it had won a reputation as one of the most powerful statesmen of the age.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston,'' pp. 248\u201360</ref>\n\nIn September 1838, Palmerston appointed a British consul in Jerusalem, without the conventional consultation of the Board of Trade, and gave instruction to assist with the construction of an Anglican church in the city, under the prompting influences of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], a prominent [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionist]].<ref name= Lewis>{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Donald | title = The Origins of Christian Zionism: Lord Shaftesbury And Evangelical Support For A Jewish Homeland | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year=2014 | page = 380 | isbn =9781107631960}}</ref>\n\n===China: First Opium War===\n{{See also|Destruction of opium at Humen}}\n[[File:Canton from the Heights.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|British bombardment of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] from the surrounding heights, May 1841]]\n\nChina restricted trade under the [[Canton System]] (a similar policy to the policies of various European countries<ref>{{cite book |last1=Peer Vries |title=State, Economy and the Great Divergence: Great Britain and China, 1680s-1850s |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1472526403 |pages=353\u2013354}}</ref> ) and permitted official diplomatic relations only to tributary countries. Palmerston saw this as an affront to his free trade principles, and demanded reform, sending [[William Napier, 9th Lord Napier|Lord Napier]] to negotiate in 1834. China refused, and interdicted the British smugglers bringing in [[History of opium in China|opium]] from India, which was banned in China. The upshot was the [[First Opium War]], 1839\u201342, which ended in the conquest of [[Zhoushan|Chusan]] by [[Henry Pottinger]]. It was later exchanged for the island of [[Hong Kong]]. Under the [[Treaty of Nanjing]], China paid an indemnity and opened five [[treaty ports]] to world trade.

This made him very popular among the ordinary people of Britain, but his passion, propensity to act through personal animosity, and imperious language made him seem dangerous and destabilising in the eyes of the queen and his more conservative colleagues in government.  Meanwhile he manipulated information and public opinion to enhance his control of his department, including controlling communications within the office and to other officials. He leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control and more publicity, all the while stirring up British nationalism.<ref>John K.

The crisis was past, but the change which took place by the substitution of [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] for [[Adolphe Thiers]] in France, and of [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] for Palmerston in Britain was a fortunate event for the peace of the world. Palmerston had adopted the opinion that peace with France was not to be relied on, and indeed that war between the two countries was sooner or later inevitable. Aberdeen and Guizot inaugurated a different policy: by mutual confidence and friendly offices, they entirely succeeded in restoring the most cordial understanding between the two governments, and the irritation which Palmerston had inflamed gradually subsided. During the administration of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], Palmerston led a retired life, but he attacked with characteristic bitterness the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with the United States. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 resolved several Canadian boundary disputes with the United States, particularly the border between [[New Brunswick]] and the State of [[Maine]] and between Canada and the State of [[Minnesota]] from Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods. Much as he criticised it, the treaty successfully closed the border questions with which Palmerston had long been concerned.<ref>Robert Remini, ''Daniel Webster'' (W. W. Norton and Co.: New York, 1997) pp. 538\u2013565.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's reputation as an interventionist and his unpopularity with the Queen and other grandees was such that [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell's]] attempt in December 1845 to form a ministry failed because [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] refused to join a government in which Palmerston would direct foreign affairs. A few months later, however, the Whigs returned to power and Palmerston to the Foreign Office (July 1846). Russell replied to critics that Palmerston's policies had \"a ''tendency'' to produce war\" but that he had advanced British interests without a major conflict, if not entirely peaceably.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Foreign Secretary: 1846\u20131851==\nPalmerston's years as foreign secretary, 1846-1851, involve dealing with violent upheavals all over Europe \u2013 he has been dubbed \"the gunpowder minister\" by biographer David Brown.<ref>David Brown., ''Palmerston: A Biography'' (2010) pp 279\u2013333.</ref>\n\n===France and Spain, 1845===\n{{Main|Affair of the Spanish Marriages}}\n[[Image:Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Palmerston, c. 1845]]\nThe French government regarded the appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities. They availed themselves of a dispatch in which he had put forward the name of a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain as a justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. However little the conduct of the French government in this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is certain that it originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] and the other powers of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small loss of honourable reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ewing Ritchie|title=The life and times of viscount Palmerston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kABAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA648|year=1866|page=648}}</ref>\n\nHistorian David Brown rejects the traditional interpretation to the effect that Aberdeen had forged an entente cordiale with France in the early 1840s whereupon the belligerent Palmerston after 1846 destroyed that friendly relationship.

Palmerston sympathised openly with the revolutionary party abroad. In particular, he was a strong advocate of [[national self-determination]], and stood firmly on the side of constitutional liberties on the Continent. Despite this, he was bitterly opposed to [[Irish nationalism|Irish independence]], and deeply hostile to the [[Young Ireland]] movement.<ref>R. W. Seton-Watson, ''Britain in Europe: 1789-1914'' (1937) pp 241-49.</ref>\n\n===Italian independence===\nNo state was regarded by him with more aversion than [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. Yet, his opposition to Austria was chiefly based upon its occupation of northeastern Italy and [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|its Italian policy]]. Palmerston maintained that the existence of Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in the political views of Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been passionately awakened by the cause of [[Italian unification|Italian independence]]. He supported the Sicilians against the [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King]] of [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Naples]], and even allowed arms to be sent them from the arsenal at Woolwich. Although he had endeavoured to restrain the [[Charles Albert of Sardinia|King]] of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] from his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an envoy to London to request the mediation of Britain, based on a large cession of Italian territory. Palmerston rejected the terms he might have obtained for Piedmont. After a couple of years this wave of revolution was replaced by a wave of reaction.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 343-48.</ref><ref>Herbert C. F.

[[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] assumed the government of the empire with dictatorial power. In spite of what Palmerston termed his judicious bottle-holding, the movement he had encouraged and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere subdued. The British government, or at least Palmerston as its representative, was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the French republic.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 355.</ref> Even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by Palmerston's attack on Greece. When [[Lajos Kossuth]], the Hungarian democrat and leader of its constitutionalists, landed in England in 1851 to wide applause, Palmerston proposed to receive him at Broadlands, a design which was only prevented by a peremptory vote of the cabinet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Laurence Fenton|title=Palmerston and the Times: Foreign Policy, the Press and Public Opinion in Mid-Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbXpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119|year=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=119\u201320|isbn=9780857736512}}</ref>\n\n===Royal and parliamentary reaction to 1848===\nThis state of things was regarded with the utmost annoyance by the British court and by most of the British ministers. On many occasions, Palmerston had taken important steps without their knowledge, which they disapproved.  Over the [[Foreign Office]] he asserted and exercised an arbitrary dominion, which the feeble efforts of the premier could not control. The Queen and the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] did not conceal their indignation at the fact that they were held responsible for Palmerston's actions by the other Courts of Europe.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 333-58.</ref>\n\nWhen Disraeli attacked Palmerston's foreign policy, the foreign minister responded to a five-hour speech by [[Thomas Chisholm Anstey|Anstey]] with a five-hour speech of his own, the first of two great speeches in which he laid out a comprehensive defence of his foreign policy and of liberal interventionism more generally. Arguing for domestic political effect, Palmerston declaimed:\n:I hold that the real policy of England... is to be the champion of justice and right, pursuing that course with moderation and prudence, not becoming the [[Don Quixote (character)|Quixote]] of the world, but giving the weight of her moral sanction and support wherever she thinks that justice is, and whenever she thinks that wrong has been done.<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd Hilton|title=A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People?: England 1783-1846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDFHmqU_6SEC&pg=PR248|year=2006|page=247|isbn=9780191606823}}</ref>\n\nRussell and the Queen both hoped that the other would take the initiative and dismiss Palmerston; the Queen was dissuaded by her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], who took the limits of constitutional power very seriously, and Russell by Palmerston's prestige with the people and his competence in an otherwise remarkably inept Cabinet.\n\n===Don Pacifico Affair===\n{{main|Don Pacifico Affair}}\nIn 1847 the home of [[Don Pacifico]], a Gibraltarian merchant living in Athens, Greece, was attacked by an anti-Semitic mob which included the sons of a Greek government minister. The Greek police did not intervene in the attack, despite being present.<ref>Ridley, pp. 374\u2013375.</ref> Because Don Pacifico was a British subject, the British government expressed concern.

The House of Commons was moved by [[John Arthur Roebuck|Roebuck]] to reverse the rebuke, which it did on 29 June by a majority of 46, after having heard from Palmerston on 25 June. This was the most eloquent and powerful speech he ever delivered, wherein he sought to vindicate not only his claims on the Greek government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration of foreign affairs.\n{{wikisource|Don Pacifico Speech}}\nIt was in this speech, which lasted for five hours, that Palmerston made the well known declaration that a British subject ought everywhere to be protected by the strong arm of the British government against injustice and wrong; comparing the reach of the British Empire to that of the Roman Empire, in which a Roman citizen could walk the earth unmolested by any foreign power. This was the famous ''[[Civis Romanus sum]]'' (\"I am a citizen of Rome\") speech. After this speech, Palmerston's popularity had never been greater.<ref>Ridley, pp. 387\u201394.</ref>\n\n===Crossing the Queen and resigning, 1851===\nNotwithstanding his parliamentary triumph in the Don Pacifico affair, many of his own colleagues and supporters criticized the spirit in which the foreign relations of the Crown were carried on. The Queen addressed a minute to the Prime Minister in which she recorded her dissatisfaction at the manner in which Palmerston evaded the obligation to submit his measures for the royal sanction as failing in sincerity to the Crown. This minute was communicated to Palmerston, who accepted its criticisms.<ref>Ridley, pp. 394\u2013395.</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 1851, [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] \u2013 who had been elected President of France in 1848 \u2013 carried out a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by dissolving the National Assembly and arresting the leading Republicans. Palmerston privately congratulated Napoleon on his triumph, noting that Britain's constitution was rooted in history but that France had had five revolutions since 1789, with the [[French Constitution of 1848]] being a \"day-before-yesterday tomfoolery which the scatterbrain heads of [[Armand Marrast|Marrast]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]] invented for the torment and perplexity of the French nation\".<ref>Ridley, p. 398.</ref> However, the Cabinet decided that Britain must be neutral, and so Palmerston requested his officials to be diplomatic. Palmerston's widespread support among the press, educated public opinion, and ordinary Britons caused apprehension and distrust among other politicians and angered the Court.

It was regarded as impossible for them to form a government without Palmerston, so he was made [[Home Secretary]] in December 1852.

He attempted to pass a Bill that confirmed the rights of workers to combine but this was thrown out by the House of Lords. He introduced the [[Truck Acts|Truck Act]] which stopped the practice of employers paying workmen in goods instead of money, or forcing them to purchase goods from shops owned by the employers.  In August 1853 Palmerston introduced the Smoke Abatement Act in order to combat the increasing smoke from coal fires, a problem greatly aggravated by the Industrial Revolution.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\">Ridley, p. 407.</ref> He also oversaw the passage of the [[Vaccination Act 1853]] into law, which was introduced as a private member's bill, and which Palmerston persuaded the government to support.  The Act made vaccination of children compulsory for the first time.  Palmerston outlawed the burying of the dead in churches.  The right to bury the dead in churches was held by wealthy families whose ancestors had purchased the right in the past.  Palmerston opposed this practice on public health grounds and ensured that all bodies were buried in a churchyard or public cemetery.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 407\"/>\n\n===Penal reform===\nPalmerston reduced the period in which prisoners could be held in [[solitary confinement]] from eighteen months to nine months.<ref>Ridley, p. 408.</ref> He also ended transportation to [[Tasmania]] for prisoners by passing the Penal Servitude Act 1853, which also reduced the maximum sentences for most offences.<ref>Ridley, pp. 408\u2013409.</ref> Palmerston passed the Reformatory Schools Act 1854 which gave the Home Secretary powers to send juvenile prisoners to a reformatory school instead of prison. He was forced to accept an amendment which ensured that the prisoner had to have spent at least three months in jail first.<ref>Ridley, pp. 409\u2013410.</ref> When in October 1854 Palmerston visited [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst]] jail and conversed with three boy inmates, he was impressed by their behaviour and ordered that they be sent to a reformatory school. He found the ventilation in the cells unsatisfactory and ordered that they be improved.<ref>Ridley, p. 410.</ref>\n\nPalmerston strongly opposed [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]'s plans for giving the vote to sections of the urban working-classes. When the Cabinet agreed in December 1853 to introduce a bill during the next session of Parliament in the form which Russell wanted, Palmerston resigned. However, Aberdeen told him that no definite decision on reform had been taken and persuaded Palmerston to return to the Cabinet.  The electoral Reform Bill did not pass Parliament that year.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 403-405.</ref>\n\n===Crimean War===\nPalmerston's exile from his traditional realm of the Foreign Office meant he did not have full control over British policy during the events precipitating the [[Crimean War]]. One of his biographers, [[Jasper Ridley]], argues that had he been in control of foreign policy at this time, war in the Crimea would have been avoided.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 414.</ref> Palmerston argued in Cabinet, after Russian troops concentrated on the Ottoman border in February 1853, that the Royal Navy should join the French fleet in the [[Dardanelles]] as a warning to Russia. He was overruled, however.\n\nIn May 1853 the Russians threatened to invade the principalities [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] unless the Ottoman Sultan surrendered to their demands. Palmerston argued for immediate decisive action; the Royal Navy should be sent to the Dardanelles to assist the Turkish navy and that Britain should inform Russia of the intention to go to war if it invaded the principalities. However, Aberdeen objected to all of Palmerston's proposals. After prolonged arguments, a reluctant Aberdeen agreed to send a fleet to the Dardanelles but objected to his other proposals. The Russian Emperor was annoyed by Britain's actions but it was not enough to deter him. When the British fleet arrived at the Dardanelles the weather was rough so the fleet took refuge in the outer waters of the straits. The Russians argued that this was a violation of the [[Straits Convention]] of 1841 and therefore invaded the two principalities. Palmerston thought that this was the result of British weakness and thought that if the Russians had been told that if they invaded the principalities the British and French fleets would enter the [[Bosphorus]] or the [[Black Sea]], they would have been deterred.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 415\u2013416.</ref> In Cabinet, Palmerston argued for a vigorous prosecution of the war against Russia by Britain but Aberdeen objected, as he wanted peace. Public opinion was on the side of the Turks and with Aberdeen becoming steadily unpopular, [[Lord Dudley Stuart]] in February 1854 noted, \"Wherever I go, I have heard but one opinion on the subject, and that one opinion has been pronounced in a single word, or in a single name \u2013 Palmerston.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 419.</ref>\n\n[[File:British General Cathcart death at Inkerman.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Battle of Inkerman]], November 1854]]\n\nOn 28 March 1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia for refusing to withdraw from the principalities. The war progressed slowly, with no gains in the Baltic and slow gains in Crimea at the long [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]].  Dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war was growing with the public in Britain and in other countries, aggravated by reports of fiascos and failures, especially the mismanagement of the heroic [[Charge of the Light Brigade]] at the [[Battle of Balaclava]]. The health and living conditions of the British soldiers was notorious and the press, with correspondents in the field, made the most of it. Tories demanded an accounting of all soldiers, cavalry and sailors sent to the Crimea and accurate figures as to the number of casualties. When Parliament passed a bill to investigate by the vote of 305 to 148, Aberdeen said he had lost a vote of no confidence and resigned as prime minister on 30 January 1855.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dick |last=Leonard|title=The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|url={{Google books|7Kosl75aYPAC|The Great Rivalry: Gladstone and Disraeli|page=98|plainurl=yes}}|year=2013|publisher=I.B.

Derby offered Palmerston the office of Secretary of State for War which he accepted under the condition that [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] remained as Foreign Secretary. Clarendon refused and so Palmerston refused Derby's offer and Derby subsequently gave up trying to form a government. The Queen sent for [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]] but he was too old to accept:  so she asked Russell; but none of his former colleagues except Palmerston wanted to serve under him. Having exhausted the possible alternatives, the Queen invited Palmerston to Buckingham Palace on 4 February 1855 to form a government.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 433-36.</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1855\u20131858==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[First premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[First prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Whig government, 1855\u20131858}}\n\nAged 70 years, 109 days, Palmerston became the oldest person in British political history to be appointed Prime Minister for the first time. As of 2020 no Prime Minister entering [[10 Downing Street]] for the first time since Palmerston has surpassed his record.\n\n===Ending the Crimean War===\n[[File:Lord Palmerston 1855.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Lord Palmerston, c. 1855 by Francis Cruikshank]]\nPalmerston took a hard line on the war; he wanted to expand the fighting, especially in the Baltic where St. Petersburg could be threatened by superior British naval power. His goal was to permanently reduce the Russian threat to Europe. Sweden and Prussia were willing to join, and Russia stood alone. However, France, which had sent far more soldiers to the war than Britain, and had suffered far more casualties, wanted the war to end, as did Austria.<ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2010) pp 402\u2013408</ref>  In March 1855 the old Tsar died and was succeeded by his son, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], who wished to make peace. However, Palmerston found the peace terms too soft on Russia and so persuaded [[Napoleon III of France]] to break off the peace negotiations until Sevastopol could be captured, putting the allies in a stronger negotiating position. In September Sevastopol finally surrendered and the allies had full control of the Black Sea theatre. Russia came to terms. On 27 February 1856 an armistice was signed and after a month's negotiations an agreement was signed at the [[Congress of Paris (1856)|Congress of Paris]]. Palmerston's demand for a demilitarised Black Sea was secured, although his wish for the Crimea to be returned to the Ottomans was not. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|peace treaty]] was signed on 30 March 1856. In April 1856 Palmerston was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]] by Victoria.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 437-53/</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Palmerston-engraving.jpg|thumb|Original engraving by D.J.

When the Chinese Commissioner [[Ye Mingchen]] refused to apologize, the British shelled his compound. The commissioner retaliated with a proclamation that called on the people of Canton to \"unite in exterminating these troublesome English villains\" and offered a $100 bounty for the head of any Englishman. The [[Thirteen Factories|British factories]] outside the city were also burned to the ground by incensed locals. Palmerston supported Parkes while in Parliament the British policy was strongly attacked on moral grounds by [[Richard Cobden]] and [[William Gladstone]]. Playing the patriotism card, Palmerston said that Cobden demonstrated \"an anti-English feeling, an abnegation of all those ties which bind men to their country and to their fellow countrymen, which I should hardly have expected from the lips of any member of this House. Everything that was English was wrong, and everything that was hostile to England was right.\"<ref name=R467>Ridley, p. 467.</ref> He went on to say that if a motion of censure was carried it would signal that the House had voted to \"abandon a large community of British subjects at the extreme end of the globe to a set of barbarians \u2013 a set of kidnapping, murdering, poisoning barbarians.\"<ref name=R467/> The censure motion was carried by a majority of sixteen and the [[1857 United Kingdom general election|election of 1857 followed]]. Palmerston's stance proved popular among a large section of the workers, the growing middle classes and the country's commercial and financial interests. With the expanded franchise, his party swept on a wave of popular feeling to a majority of 83, the largest since 1835. Cobden and [[John Bright]] lost their seats.\n\nIn China the [[Second Opium War]] (1856\u20131860) was another humiliating defeat for a Qing dynasty,<ref>J. Y. Wong, ''Deadly Dreams: Opium, Imperialism, and the Arrow War (1856\u20131860) in China'' (1998)</ref> already reeling as a result of the domestic [[Taiping Rebellion]].\n\n===Resignation===\n[[Image:Lord-Palmerston-Addressing-The-House-Of-Commons-During-The-Debates-On-The-Treaty-Of-France-In-February-1860,-1863.jpg|thumb|250px|Lord Palmerston Addressing the House of Commons During the Debates on the [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty|Treaty of France]] in February 1860, as painted by [[John Phillip]] (1863)]]\nAfter the election, Palmerston passed the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]], which for the first time made it possible for courts to grant a divorce and removed divorce from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. The opponents in Parliament, who included Gladstone, were the first in British history to try to kill a bill by filibuster. Nonetheless, Palmerston was determined to get the bill through, which he did.  In June news came to Britain of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Palmerston sent Sir [[Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde|Colin Campbell]] and reinforcements to India. Palmerston also agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown. This was enacted in the [[Government of India Act 1858]].  After the Italian republican [[Felice Orsini]] tried to assassinate the French emperor with a bomb made in Britain, the French were outraged (see [[Orsini affair]]). Palmerston introduced a Conspiracy to Murder bill, which made it a felony to plot in Britain to murder someone abroad. At first reading, the Conservatives voted for it but at second reading they voted against it. Palmerston lost by nineteen votes. Therefore, in February 1858 he was forced to resign.<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 472-82.</ref>\n\n==Opposition: 1858\u20131859==\nThe Conservatives lacked a majority, and Russell introduced a resolution in March 1859 arguing for widening the franchise, which the Conservatives opposed but which was carried. Parliament was dissolved and [[1859 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] ensued, which the Whigs won. Palmerston rejected an offer from Disraeli to become Conservative leader, but he attended the meeting of 6 June 1859 in Willis's Rooms at St James Street, where the Liberal Party was formed. The Queen asked [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]] to form a government, but although Palmerston agreed to serve under him, Russell did not. Therefore, on 12 June the Queen asked Palmerston to become prime minister. Russell and Gladstone agreed to serve under him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Victoria |title=The Letters of Queen Victoria: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog|year=1907|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lettersqueenvic07bensgoog/page/n483 439]\u201340}}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister: 1859\u20131865==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Second premiership of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second premiership of the Viscount Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of Lord Palmerston]], [[Second prime ministership of the Viscount Palmerston]] -->\n{{Further|Liberal government, 1859\u20131866}}\nHistorians usually regard Palmerston, starting in 1859, as the first Liberal.<ref>David Loades, ed., '' Readers Guide to British History'' (2003) 2: 998</ref> In his last premiership Palmerston oversaw the passage of important legislation.

The MP Sir [[William Henry Gregory|William Gregory]] was told by a member of the Cabinet that \"at the beginning of each session and after each holiday, Mr Gladstone used to come in charged to the muzzle with all sorts of schemes of all sorts of reforms which were absolutely necessary in his opinion to be immediately undertaken. Palmerston used to look fixedly at the paper before him, saying nothing until there was a lull in Gladstone's outpouring. He then rapped the table and said cheerfully: 'Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business'.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 563.</ref> Palmerston told Lord Shaftesbury: \"Gladstone will soon have it all his own way and whenever he gets my place we shall have strange doings\". He told another friend that he thought Gladstone would wreck the Liberal Party and end up in a madhouse.<ref>Ridley, p. 566.</ref>\n\nWhen in May 1864 the MP [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines]] introduced a Reform Bill in the Commons, Palmerston ordered Gladstone to not commit himself and the government to any particular scheme.<ref>Philip Guedalla (ed.), ''Gladstone and Palmerston, being the Correspondence of Lord Palmerston with Mr. Gladstone 1851\u20131865'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1928), p. 279.</ref> Instead Gladstone said in his speech in the Commons that he did not see why any man should not have the vote unless he was mentally incapacitated, but added that this would not come about unless the working class showed an interest in reform. Palmerston believed that this was incitement to the working class to begin agitating for reform and told Gladstone: \"What every Man and Woman too have a Right to, is to be well governed and under just Laws, and they who propose a change ought to shew that the present organization does not accomplish those objects\".<ref>Guedalla, p. 282.</ref>\n\n[[Second Italian War of Independence|French intervention in Italy]] had created an invasion scare and Palmerston established a [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] which reported in 1860. It recommended a huge [[Palmerston Forts|programme of fortifications]] to protect the [[Royal Navy Dockyards]] and ports, which Palmerston vigorously supported. Objecting to the enormous expense, Gladstone repeatedly threatened to resign as Chancellor when the proposals were accepted. Palmerston said that he had received so many resignation letters from Gladstone that he feared that they would set fire to the chimney.<ref>Ridley, p. 564.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Lord Lyons===\nDuring the advent and occurrence of the [[American Civil War]], the British Ambassador to the United States was Palmerston's close friend and ally [[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons, 2nd Baron Lyons]]. Palmerston had first appointed Richard Lyons to the Foreign Service in 1839, and was a close friend of his father, [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons]], with whom he had vehemently advocated increased aggression in the [[Crimean War]]. Palmerston and Lyons both had similar sociopolitical sympathies: both advocated monarchy and foreign interventionism. Throughout the American Civil War, Palmerston and Richard Lyons maintained an extensive confidential correspondence. Their actions were responsible for the peaceful resolution of the [[Trent Affair]]. When Lyons resigned from the position of American Ambassador, Palmerston attempted to persuade him to return, but Lyons declined the offer.<ref name=\"Jenkins Lyons\">{{cite book|title=Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War|author=Jenkins, Brian|publisher=McGill-Queen\u2019s Press, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\nPalmerston's sympathies in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) were with the secessionist [[Confederate States of America]]. Although a professed opponent of the slave trade and [[slavery]], he held a lifelong hostility towards the United States, and believed a dissolution of the Union would weaken America, thereby enhancing British power. Additionally, the Confederacy \"would afford a valuable and extensive market for British manufactures\".<ref>Ridley, p. 552.</ref><ref>Kevin Peraino, \"Lincoln vs. Palmerston\" in Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 120\u201369.</ref>\n\nBritain issued a [[s:British proclamation of neutrality in the American Civil War|proclamation of neutrality]] at the beginning of the Civil War on 13 May 1861. The Confederacy was recognised as a [[belligerent]] but it was too premature to recognise it as a sovereign state. The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[William Seward]], threatened to treat as hostile any country which recognised the Confederacy. Britain depended more on American corn than Confederate cotton, and a war with the U.S. would not be in Britain's economic interest.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Paterson|author2=J.

He was very pleased with the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in July 1861, but 15 months later he felt: <blockquote>\"...the American War... has manifestly ceased to have any attainable object as far as the Northerns are concerned, except to get rid of some more thousand troublesome Irish and Germans. It must be owned, however, that the Anglo-Saxon race on both sides have shown courage and endurance highly honourable to their stock.\"<ref name=R559>Ridley, p. 559.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]] in November 1861 produced public outrage in Britain and a diplomatic crisis. A U.S. Navy warship stopped the British steamer ''Trent'' and seized two Confederate envoys ''en route'' to Europe.  Palmerston called the action \"a declared and gross insult\", demanded the release of the two diplomats and ordered 3,000 troops to Canada.  In a letter to Queen Victoria on 5 December 1861 he said that if his demands were not met: <blockquote>\"Great Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon be forgotten.\"<ref name=R554>Ridley, p. 554.</ref></blockquote> In another letter to his foreign secretary, he predicted war between Britain and the Union:\n<blockquote>\"It is difficult not to come to the conclusion that the rabid hatred of England which animates the exiled Irishmen who direct almost all the Northern newspapers, will so excite the masses as to make it impossible for Lincoln and Seward to grant our demands; and we must therefore look forward to war as the probable result.\"<ref name=R554/></blockquote>\nIn fact, Irishmen did not control any major newspapers in the North, and the U.S. decided to release the prisoners rather than risk war. Palmerston was convinced the presence of troops in Canada persuaded the U.S. to acquiesce.<ref>Kenneth Bourne, \"British Preparations for War with the North, 1861\u20131862,\" ''The English Historical Review'' Vol 76 No 301 (Oct 1961) pp 600\u2013632 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/558199 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nAfter President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s announcement in September 1862 that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in ninety days, the cabinet debated intervention as a humanitarian move to stop a likely race war. At the same time however there was a cabinet crisis in France over the overthrow of the Greek king and the growing Eastern Question with regard to Russia. The British Government had to determine whether the situation in North America or the containment of Russia was more urgent. The decision was to give priority to threats closer to home and to decline France's suggestion of a joint intervention in America; the threatened race war over slavery never happened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eichhorn | first1 = Niels | year = 2014 | title = The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma? | url = | journal = American Nineteenth Century History | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 287\u2013310 | doi = 10.1080/14664658.2014.959819 }}</ref> Palmerston rejected all further efforts of the Confederacy to gain British recognition.<ref name=\"R559\"/>\n[[Image:Lord Palmerston 1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Carte de visite]] depicting Lord Palmerston, 1863]]\n\nThe raiding ship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], built in the British port of [[Birkenhead]], was another difficulty for Palmerston. On 29 July 1862, a law officer's report he had commissioned advised him to detain ''Alabama'', as its construction was a breach of Britain's neutrality. Palmerston ordered ''Alabama'' detained on 31 July, but it had already put to sea before the order reached Birkenhead. In her subsequent cruise, ''Alabama'' captured or destroyed many Union merchant ships, as did other raiders fitted out in Britain.  The U.S. accused Britain of complicity in the construction of the raiders.  This was the basis of the postwar [[Alabama claims|''Alabama'' claims]] for damages against Britain, which Palmerston refused to pay.  After his death, Gladstone acknowledged the U.S. claim and agreed to arbitration, paying out $15,500,000 in damages.\n\nIn the autumn of 1862, Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, opened a cabinet debate on whether Britain should intervene. Gladstone had a favourable image of the Confederacy, and indeed of slavery (his family wealth depended on slavery in the [[British West Indies|West Indies]]). He emphasized the humanitarian intervention to stop the staggering death toll, risk of a race war, and failure of the Union to achieve decisive military results, but Prime Minister Palmerston had other concerns at the same time, including a crisis connected with the overthrow of the Greek king, which put the Eastern Question in play. The Cabinet decided that the American situation was less urgent than the need to contain Russian expansion,  so it rejected Gladstone's suggestions.<ref>Niels Eichhorn, \"The Intervention Crisis of 1862: A British Diplomatic Dilemma?\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 15#3 (2014) pp 287\u2013310.</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\nThe [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]n Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]] wanted to annex the Danish territory of [[Schleswig]] and the German territory of [[Holstein]], whose Duke was the King of Denmark, chiefly for its port of [[Kiel]], and had an alliance with Austria for this purpose. In a speech to the Commons on 23 July 1863, Palmerston said the British government, like those of France and Russia, wished that \"the independence, the integrity, and the rights of Denmark may be maintained. We are convinced\u2014I am convinced at least\u2014that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow those rights and interfere with that independence, those who made the attempt would find in the result that it would not be Denmark alone with which they would have to contend\".<ref>Ridley, pp. 570\u2013571.</ref> Palmerston's stance derived from the traditional belief that France was the greater threat to Britain and was much stronger than Austria and Prussia.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\">Ridley, p. 571.</ref>\n\nFor five months Bismarck did nothing. However, in November the Danish government instituted a new constitution whereby Holstein was bound closer to Denmark. Schleswig had already been a part of Denmark for centuries. By the year's end, the Prussian and Austrian armies were massing on the [[River Eider]]. On 1 February 1864 the Prussian-Austrian armies [[Second Schleswig War|invaded Schleswig-Holstein]], and ten days afterwards the Danish government requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his soldiers that were placed on the borders of Prussia's Rhineland provinces. Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 571\"/>\n\nIn April Austria's navy was on its way to attack Copenhagen, and Palmerston saw the Austrian ambassador and informed him that Britain could not allow their navy to sail through the English Channel if their intent was to attack Denmark, and if it entered the Baltic the result would be war with Britain. The ambassador replied that the Austrian navy would not enter the Baltic and it did not do so.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\">Ridley, p. 572.</ref>\n\nPalmerston accepted Russell's suggestion that the war should be settled at a conference, but at the ensuing [[London Conference of 1864]] in May and June the Danes refused to accept their loss of Schleswig-Holstein. The armistice ended on 26 June and Prussian-Austrian troops quickly invaded more of Denmark. On 25 June the Cabinet was against going to war to save Denmark, but Russell's suggestion to send the Royal Navy to defend Copenhagen was only carried by Palmerston's vote. Palmerston, however, said the fleet could not be sent in view of the deep division in the Cabinet.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 572\"/>\n\nOn 27 June Palmerston gave his statement to the Commons and said Britain would not go to war with the German powers unless the existence of Denmark as an independent power was at stake or that Denmark's capital was threatened. The Conservatives replied that Palmerston had betrayed the Danes and a vote of censure in the House of Lords was carried by nine votes. In the debate in the Commons the Conservative MP [[Jonathan Peel|General Peel]] said: \"It is come to this, that the words of the Prime Minister of England{{sic}}, uttered in the Parliament of England{{sic}}, are to be regarded as mere idle menaces to be laughed at and despised by foreign powers?\"  Palmerston replied in the last night of the debate: \"I say that England stands as high as she ever did and those who say she had fallen in the estimation of the world are not the men to whom the honour and dignity of England should be confided\".<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) pp. 573-74.</ref>\n\nThe vote of censure was defeated by 313 votes to 295, with Palmerston's old enemies in the pacifist camp, Cobden and Bright, voting for him. The result of the vote was announced at 2:30 in the morning, and when Palmerston heard the news he ran up the stairs to the Ladies' Gallery and embraced his wife. Disraeli wrote: \"What pluck to mount those dreadful stairs at three o'clock in the morning, and eighty years of age!\"<ref>Ridley, ''Lord Palmerston'' (1970) p. 574.</ref>\n\nIn a speech at his constituency at [[Tiverton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tiverton]] in August, Palmerston told his constituents:\n\n<blockquote>I am sure every Englishman who has a heart in his breast and a feeling of justice in his mind, sympathizes with those unfortunate Danes (cheers), and wishes that this country could have been able to draw the sword successfully in their defence (continued cheers); but I am satisfied that those who reflect on the season of the year when that war broke out, on the means which this country could have applied for deciding in one sense that issue, I am satisfied that those who make these reflections will think that we acted wisely in not embarking in that dispute. (Cheers.) To have sent a fleet in midwinter to the Baltic every sailor would tell you was an impossibility, but if it could have gone it would have been attended by no effectual result. Ships sailing on the sea cannot stop armies on land, and to have attempted to stop the progress of an army by sending a fleet to the Baltic would have been attempting to do that which it was not possible to accomplish. (Hear, hear.) If England could have sent an army, and although we all know how admirable that army is on the peace establishment, we must acknowledge that we have no means of sending out a force at all equal to cope with the 300,000 or 400,000 men whom the 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of Germany could have pitted against us, and that such an attempt would only have insured a disgraceful discomfiture\u2014not to the army, indeed, but to the Government which sent out an inferior force and expected it to cope successfully with a force so vastly superior. (Cheers.) ... we did not think that the Danish cause would be considered as sufficiently British, and as sufficiently bearing on the interests and the security and the honour of England, as to make it justifiable to ask the country to make those exertions which such a war would render necessary.<ref>\u2018Lord Palmerston At Tiverton\u2019, ''The Times'' (24 August 1864), p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEuropean leaders watched in confusion, unable to settle the matter by peaceful compromise. British diplomacy was in the same state.  His biographer William Baring Pemberton noticed: \"Palmerston's failure to understand Bismarck lies at the root of his misunderstanding of the Schleswig-Holstein question, and it derived from an old man's inability to adapt himself to a changing world\".<ref>William Baring Pemberton, ''Lord Palmerston'' (Batchworth Press, 1954)  p.332</ref>  Thus Britain was unable to stop Prussia and misunderstood Bismarck's ambitions. Russian historian Vinogradov V. N. writes: \"In place of the former insight came bias in judgments and stubbornness in defending outdated views. Palmerston continued to consider Prussia as \"instrument in the hands of Austria\", its army - weak and doomed to defeat, and its public - consisting of romantically minded students and dreamy professors. And Otto von Bismarck quietly annexed to the Prussia two Duchies, and at the same time the County of Lauenburg\".<ref>Vinogradov V.N. Lord Parmerston in European diplomacy. New and recent history. 2006. N5. In Russian.</ref> Britain actually approved the first step to the emergence of the Reich, to the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia by [[Blood and Iron (speech)|\"blood and iron\"]].\n\n===Electoral victory===\nPalmerston won another [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election in July 1865]], increasing his majority.  The leadership of Palmerston was a great electoral asset to the Liberal Party.<ref>Ridley, p. 579.</ref> He then had to deal with the outbreak of [[Fenian]] violence in Ireland. Palmerston ordered the [[Viceroy of Ireland]], [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Wodehouse]], to take measures against this, including a possible suspension of trial-by-jury and a monitoring of Americans travelling to Ireland. He believed that the [[Fenian]] agitation was caused by America. On 27 September 1865 he wrote to the Secretary for War:\n<blockquote>The American assault on Ireland under the name of Fenianism may be now held to have failed, but the snake is only scotched and not killed. It is far from impossible that the American conspirators may try and obtain in our North American provinces compensation for their defeat in Ireland.<ref>Ridley, p. 581.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe advised that more armaments be sent to Canada and more troops be sent to Ireland. During these last few weeks of his life, Palmerston pondered on developments in foreign affairs. He began thinking of a new friendship with France as \"a sort of preliminary defensive alliance\" against America and looked forward to Prussia becoming more powerful as this would balance against the growing threat from Russia.  In a letter to Russell he warned that Russia \"will in due time become a power almost as great as the old Roman Empire&nbsp;... Germany ought to be strong in order to resist Russian aggression.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 582.</ref> Palmerston's successors had a very different task-to restrain an aggressive Germany.\n\n==Death==\nPalmerston enjoyed robust health in old age,<ref>Hibbert, Christopher ''Disraeli: A Personal History'' (2004) p. 256</ref> living at [[Romsey]] in his home Foxhills, built in about 1840. On 12 October 1865 he caught a chill, and instead of retiring immediately to bed he spent an hour and a half [[Death during consensual sex#Notable cases|dawdling]]. He then had a violent fever but his condition stabilised for the next few days. However, on the night of 17 October his health worsened, and when his doctor asked him if he believed in regeneration of the world through Jesus Christ, Palmerston replied: \"Oh, surely.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\">Ridley, p. 583.</ref> His last words were, \"That's Article 98; now go on to the next.\" (He was thinking about diplomatic treaties.)<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 583\"/> An apocryphal version of his last words is: \"Die, my dear doctor? That is the last thing I shall do.\" He died at 10:45 am on Wednesday, 18 October 1865 two days before his eighty-first birthday. Although Palmerston wanted to be buried at [[Romsey Abbey]], the Cabinet insisted that he should have a [[state funeral]] and be buried at [[Westminster Abbey]], which he was, on 27 October 1865. He was the fourth person not of royalty to be granted a state funeral (after [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]).\n\nQueen Victoria wrote after his death that though she regretted his passing, she had never liked or respected him: \"Strange, and solemn to think of that strong, determined man, with so much worldly ambition \u2013 gone! He had often worried and distressed us, though as Pr. Minister he had behaved ''very well''.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\">Ridley, p. 584.</ref> [[Florence Nightingale]] reacted differently upon hearing of his death: \"He will be a great loss to us. Tho' he made a joke when asked to do the right thing, he always did it. No one else will be able to carry things thro' the Cabinet as he did. I shall lose a powerful protector...He was so much more in earnest than he appeared. He did not do himself justice.\"<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 584\"/>\n\nHe was succeeded by his stepson [[William Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple|William Cowper-Temple]] (later created [[Baron Mount Temple|The 1st Baron Mount Temple]]), whose inheritance included a 10,000-acre estate in the north of [[County Sligo]] in the west of [[Ireland]], on which his stepfather had commissioned the building of the incomplete [[Classiebawn Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sligoheritage.com/archirishvillage.htm|title= Profile of an Irish Village-Palmerston and the Conquest, Colonisation and Evolution of Mullaghmore, Co. Sligo|accessdate = 26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHistorian Algernon Cecil, summed up his greatness:\n: Palmerston placed his trust... in the Press which he was at pains to manipulate; in Parliament, which he learnt better than any man then living to manage; and the Country, whose temper he knew how to catch and the weight of his name and resources he brought to bear upon every negotiation with a patriotic effontry that has never been excelled.<ref>Algernon Cecil, ''British Foreign Secretaries, 1807\u20131916'' (1927) p 139</ref>\n\nPalmerston has traditionally been viewed as \"a Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad\".<ref>Ridley, p. 587.</ref> He believed that the British constitution as secured by the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 was the best which human hands had made, with a constitutional monarchy subject to the laws of the land but retaining some political power. He supported the rule of law and opposed further democratisation after the [[Reform Act 1832]]. He wished to see this liberal system of a mixed constitution in-between the two extremes of absolute monarchy and republican democracy replace the absolute monarchies on the Continent.<ref>Ridley, p. 588.</ref> More recently some historians have seen his domestic policies as Prime Minister as not merely liberal but genuinely progressive by the standards of his era.<ref>David Steele, ''Palmerston and Liberalism, 1855\u20131865'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991).</ref>\n\n[[File:\"Capture of the King of Delhi by Captain Hodson\".jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Palmerston agreed to transfer the authority of the [[British East India Company]] to the Crown.]]\nHowever, it is in foreign affairs that Palmerston is chiefly remembered. Palmerston's principal aim in foreign policy was to advance the national interests of England.<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\"/> Palmerston is famous for his patriotism. [[Lord John Russell]] said that \"his heart always beat for the honour of England\".<ref>''The Times'' (10 November 1865), p. 7.</ref> Palmerston believed it was in Britain's interests that liberal governments be established on the Continent. He also practised brinkmanship and bluff in that he was prepared to threaten war to achieve Britain's interests.<ref>Ridely, p. 589.</ref>\n\nPalmerston's foreign policy achievements were very short-term. The peace conditions of the Congress of Paris collapsed with the defeat of France in the war with Prussia in 1870-71. The European balance was upset with the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia in 1871.\n\nWhen in 1886 [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] became Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's government, [[John Bright]] asked him if he had read about Palmerston's policies as Foreign Secretary. Rosebery replied that he had. \"Then\", said Bright, \"you know what to avoid. Do the exact opposite of what he did. His administration at the Foreign Office was one long crime.\"<ref>Ridley, p. 591.</ref> The [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]] said of Palmerston in 1866: \"He loved his country and his country loved him. He lived for her honour, and she will cherish his memory.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Edinburgh Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miQ4AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA275|year=1866|page=275}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Gladstone recounted a story of when \"a Frenchman, thinking to be highly complimentary, said to Palmerston: 'If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman'; to which Pam coolly replied: 'If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Ridley, p. 589\">Ridley, p. 589.</ref> When [[Winston Churchill]] campaigned for rearmament in the 1930s, he was compared to Palmerston in warning the nation to look to its defences.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Winston Churchill. The Wilderness Years'' (London: Book Club Associates, 1981), pp. 106\u2013107.</ref> The policy of [[appeasement]] led General [[Jan Smuts]] to write in 1936 that \"we are afraid of our shadows. I sometimes long for a ruffian like Palmerston or any man who would be more than a string of platitudes and apologies.\"<ref>W. K. Hancock, ''Smuts. Volume II: The Fields of Force. 1919\u20131950'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 281.</ref>\n\nHe was also an avowed [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] whose attempts to abolish the slave trade was one of the most consistent elements of his foreign policy. His opposition to the slave trade created tensions with South American countries and the United States over his insistence that the [[Royal Navy]] had the right to search the vessels of any country if they suspected the vessels were being used in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].\n\nHistorian [[A.J.P. Taylor]] has summarised his career by emphasising the paradoxes:\n:For twenty years junior minister in a Tory government, he became the most successful of Whig Foreign Secretaries; though always a Conservative, he ended his life by presiding over the transition from Whiggism to Liberalism. He was the exponent of British strength, yet was driven from office for truckling to a foreign despot; he preached the Balance of Power, yet helped to inaugurate the policy of isolation and of British withdrawal from Europe. Irresponsible and flippant, he became the first hero of the serious middle-class electorate. He reached high office solely through an irregular family connection; he retained it through skilful use of the press\u2014the only Prime Minister to become an accomplished leader-writer.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, \"Lord Palmerston,\" ''History Today'' Jan 1991, Vol. 41#1 p 1</ref>\n\nPalmerston is also remembered for his light-hearted approach to government. He is once said to have claimed of a particularly intractable problem relating to [[Schleswig-Holstein question|Schleswig-Holstein]], that only three people had ever understood the problem: one was [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]], who was dead; the second was a German professor, who had gone insane; and the third was himself, who had forgotten it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Douglas|last1=Hurd|author1-link=Douglas Hurd|title=Choose Your Weapons: The British Foreign Secretary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpBc5JZsd5gC&pg=RA1-PR33#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-85851-5|page=33}}</ref>\n\n''The Life of Lord Palmerston up to 1847'' was written by Lord Dalling ([[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Sir H.

The whole work was reissued in a revised and slightly abridged form by Ashley in 2 volumes in 1879, with the title ''The Life and Correspondence of Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston''; the letters are judiciously curtailed, but unfortunately without indicating where the excisions occur; the appendices of the original work are omitted, but much fresh matter is added, and this edition is undoubtedly the standard biography.<ref>Stanley Lane-Poole, '[[s:Temple, Henry John (DNB00)|Temple, Henry John]]', ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885\u20131900, Volume 56''.</ref>\n\n===Places named===\n[[File:Palmerston - geograph.org.uk - 259077.jpg|thumb|right|Palmerston's Memorial in Southampton]]\n*The Town of [[Palmerston, Ontario|Palmerston]] located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada was founded and named after Lord Palmerston in 1875.

When sheets of water on a roughly planar surface first enter a depression in it, this erodes the top edge of the depression. This either causes the stream to grow longer at the very top of the stream, which moves its origin back, or causes the canyon formed by the stream to grow wider, by erosion along the length of its top side edge as sheets of water flow over the edge. Widening of the canyon by erosion inside the canyon, below the canyon side top edge, or origin or the stream, such as erosion caused by the streamflow inside it, is not called headwall erosion.\n\nHeadward erosion is a [[fluvial]] process of [[erosion]] that lengthens a [[stream]], a [[valley]] or a [[gully]] at its [[source (river or stream)|head]] and also enlarges its [[drainage basin]]. The stream erodes away at the rock and soil at its headwaters in the opposite direction that it flows. Once a stream has begun to cut back, the erosion is sped up by the steep gradient the water is flowing down. As water erodes a path from its headwaters to its mouth at a standing body of water, it tries to cut an ever-shallower path. This leads to increased erosion at the steepest parts, which is headward erosion. If headward erosion continues long enough, it can cause a stream to break through into a neighboring [[drainage basin|watershed]] and [[stream capture|capture]] drainage that previously flowed to another stream.\n\nFor example, headward erosion by the [[Shenandoah River]] in the U.S. state of [[Virginia]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Potomac River]], permitted the Shenandoah to capture successively the original upstream segments of [[Beaverdam Creek (Virginia)|Beaverdam Creek]], [[Gap Run]] and [[Goose Creek (Potomac River)|Goose Creek]], three smaller tributaries of the Potomac.  As each capture added to the Shenandoah's [[effluent|discharge]], it accelerated the process of headward erosion until the Shenandoah captured all drainage to the Potomac west of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].\n\n==Stream types created by headward erosion==\n\nThree kinds of streams are formed by headward erosion: ''insequent streams'', ''subsequent streams'', and ''obsequent and resequent streams'' (''See [[Fluvial landforms of streams]]''.) '''Insequent streams''' form by random headward erosion, usually from sheetflow of water over the landform surface. The water collects in channels where the velocity and erosional power increase, cutting into and extending the heads of gullies. '''Subsequent streams''' form by selective headward erosion by cutting away at less resistive rocks in the terrain. '''Obsequent and resequent streams''' form after time in an area of insequent or subsequent streams. Obsequent streams are insequent streams that now flow in an opposite direction of the original drainage pattern. Resequent streams are subsequent streams that have also changed direction from their original drainage patterns. (Easterbrook, p. 149)\n\n==Drainage patterns created by headward erosion==\n\nHeadward erosion creates three major kinds of drainage patterns: ''[[Drainage_system_(geomorphology)|dendritic]] patterns'', ''[[Drainage_system_(geomorphology)|trellis]] patterns'', and ''rectangular and angular patterns''. '''Dendritic patterns''' form in homogenous landforms where the underlying bedrock has no structural control over where the water flows. They have a very characteristic pattern of branching at acute angles with no common or similarly repeating pattern. '''Trellis patterns''' form in where the underlying bedrock where there is repeating weaker and stronger types of rock. The trellis pattern cuts down deeper into the weaker bedrock, and is characterized by nearly parallel streams that branch at higher angles. '''Rectangular and angular patterns''' are characterized by branching of tributaries at nearly right angles and tributaries which themselves exhibit right-angle bends in their channels. These usually form in jointed igneous bedrocks, horizontal sedimentary beds with well-developed jointing or intersecting faults. (Easterbrook, p. 149-150)\n\nFour minor kinds of drainage patterns also can be created: ''[[wikt:radial|radial]] patterns'', ''[[wikt:annular|annular]] patterns'', ''[[Centripetal force|centripetal]] patterns'' and ''[[wikt:parallel|parallel]] patterns''. '''Radial patterns''' are characterized by flow of water outward from a central point, such as down a newly formed cinder volcano cone or an intrusive domes. '''Annular patterns''' form on domes of alternating weak and hard bedrocks. The pattern formed is similar to that of a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] when viewed from above, as the weaker bedrocks are eroded and the harder are left in place. '''Centripetal patterns''' form where water flows into a central location, such as in a [[karst topography|karst]] limestone terrain where the water flows down into a [[sinkhole]] and then underground. Parallel patterns are not very common and form on unidirectional regional slope or parallel landform features. They are usually limited to a small, generalized area.

{"title_page": "Berg report", "text_new": "[[File:Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa.JPG|thumb|Cover of Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa, World Bank report published in 1981]]\n\nThe '''Berg report''' is the name most commonly used for the [[World Bank]]-published report \"Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Plan for Action,\" written by Elliot Berg in 1981. The report was written in response to a 1979 request from the African Governors of the World Bank for a paper analyzing the development problems facing African countries. It also responds to a set of policies determined by African Chiefs of State in 1980, called the [[Lagos Plan of Action]]. While the Lagos Plan endorsed inward-looking policies of African self-reliance, the Berg report advocated for outward-looking policies of increased international trade.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe report is historically important for having marked a shift in African countries\u2019 economic policies towards [[economic liberalization]]. It details several policy recommendations in its plan for action, including \u201c(1) more suitable trade and exchange-rate policies; (2) increased efficiency of resource use in the public sector; and (3) improvement in agriculture policies.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Elliot|title=Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action|date=1981|publisher=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|page=5|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/04/13/000178830_98101911444774/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> In terms of trade and exchange-rate policies, the report recommends liberalizations including \u201ccorrection of overvalued exchange rates [\u2026]; improved price incentives for exports and for agriculture; lower and more uniform protection for industry; and reduced use of direct controls.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Elliot|title=Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action|date=1981|publisher=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|page=30|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/04/13/000178830_98101911444774/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> For efficient resource usage, the Berg report identifies government and parastatal agencies as being overextended, and suggests streamlining public services, in part by allowing a greater share of these to be provided by the private sector. In the area of agriculture, they propose promoting export of cash crops by reducing taxes and other unfavorable terms of trade, as well as making domestic food markets more efficient by loosening regulation and increasing the role of the private sector in inputs (such as fertilizer) and in marketing foodstuffs (e.g. deregulating food prices).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Elliot|title=Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action|date=1981|publisher=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|pages=61\u201369|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/04/13/000178830_98101911444774/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> The report concludes with a strong appeal to international aid organizations to support African governments as they shift towards the policies of economic liberalization recommended by the World Bank.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe recommendations contained in the World Bank's report held real significance for African political leaders, as the Bank is a major development lending agency with the power to affect the identification and design of development projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=John|title=Review: The World Bank.

The report was written in response to a 1979 request from the African Governors of the World Bank for a paper analyzing the development problems facing African countries. It also responds to a set of policies determined by African Chiefs of State in 1980, called the [[Lagos Plan of Action]]. While the Lagos Plan endorsed inward-looking policies of African self-reliance, the Berg report advocated for outward-looking policies of increased international trade.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe report is historically important for having marked a shift in African countries\u2019 economic policies towards [[economic liberalization]]. It details several policy recommendations in its plan for action, including \u201c(1) more suitable trade and exchange-rate policies; (2) increased efficiency of resource use in the public sector; and (3) improvement in agriculture policies.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Elliot|title=Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action|date=1981|publisher=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|page=5|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/04/13/000178830_98101911444774/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> In terms of trade and exchange-rate policies, the report recommends liberalizations including \u201ccorrection of overvalued exchange rates [\u2026]; improved price incentives for exports and for agriculture; lower and more uniform protection for industry; and reduced use of direct controls.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Elliot|title=Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action|date=1981|publisher=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|page=30|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/04/13/000178830_98101911444774/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> For efficient resource usage, the Berg report identifies government and parastatal agencies as being overextended, and suggests streamlining public services, in part by allowing a greater share of these to be provided by the private sector. In the area of agriculture, they propose promoting export of cash crops by reducing taxes and other unfavorable terms of trade, as well as making domestic food markets more efficient by loosening regulation and increasing the role of the private sector in inputs (such as fertilizer) and in marketing foodstuffs (e.g. deregulating food prices).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Elliot|title=Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action|date=1981|publisher=International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|pages=61\u201369|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2000/04/13/000178830_98101911444774/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref> The report concludes with a strong appeal to international aid organizations to support African governments as they shift towards the policies of economic liberalization recommended by the World Bank.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe recommendations contained in the World Bank\u2019s report held real significance for African political leaders, as the Bank is a major development lending agency with the power to affect the identification and design of development projects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Howell|first1=John|title=Review: The World Bank.
