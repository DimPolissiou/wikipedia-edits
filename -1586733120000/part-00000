Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Unique Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a uniform property marking system (UPMS) that generated unique identification numbers (UIN) for storage and retrieval on a uniform identification system (UIS). The use of numerous different identifiers inhibited police efforts to return stolen property to its owners.\n\nOf the 21 police departments implementing a form of property marking programs contacted during the 1979 GAO survey:\n\n*5 recommended [[driver's license]] numbers\n*5 recommended [[Social Security number]]s\n*2 utilized a state-devised identifier\n*9 did not encourage the use of a specific identifier\n\nEven with a recommended identifier, participants in the program used vague identifiers such as initials or identifiers that were subject to change such as [[ZIP code]]s and telephone numbers making the return of stolen goods difficult.\n\nAn evaluation funded by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] in 1975 found that Operation Identification participants did experience few burglaries than their neighbors. However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens. These companies frequently dispense with marking property or use pre-Internet marking strategies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.serialnumberregistry.ca/  |title=Serial Number Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immobilise.com/  |title=Immobilise |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are newer companies that issue uniquely numbered identifier tags associated with a unique website that allows only the rightful owner of the property to enter and access serial numbers. If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]]. This strategy, via the internet, also connects a [[Good Samaritan]] with the rightful owner if the identifying tag is intact, using a regulated [[Anonymous P2P]] communication strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/  |title=My Property ID Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the United States===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] recommend similar property marking techniques to Operation Identification. They suggest the use of approved marking solutions in the form of a special marker pen or paint only visible under ultraviolet (UV) light to mark or etch personal property with the postcode, house or flat number or the first three letters of the owner's address. They also encourage that valuable items are registered with an accredited property database.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/residential-burglary/mark-your-property/  |title=Mark your property to deter burglars |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Metropolitan Police |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==LPCB guidelines==\nIn 1996, the Loss Prevention Certification\u00a0Board (LPCB) issued its first set of guidelines\u00a0for the migration of Operation Identification to the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bregroup.com/products/lpcb  |title=LPCB standards and certification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=BRE Group |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n*''Loss Prevention Standard LPS 1224'' Issue 3.1 (2014) lists the requirements for companies providing secure asset registration services.

Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Operation Identification City Park Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Operation Identification sign in [[Denver]], Colorado]]\n\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported spending roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) to fund 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency.

However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens.

Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife.

Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> and Henry's wife for just six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref>\n\n==Catherine Parr==\n{{Main|Catherine Parr}}\n[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]\n[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543\u20131547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables</ref> through more than one ancestor.<ref>{{cite

Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]].

Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife.

Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I

During the next few years, Hill traveled through the country, returning to his habits from the prior decade of initiating various short-lived business ventures.\n\nDuring 1935, Hill's wife Florence filed for a divorce in [[Florida]].\n\n=== ''Think and Grow Rich'' ===\nDuring 1937, Hill published the best-selling book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'', which became Hill's best-known work. Hill's new wife Rosa Lee Beeland contributed substantially to the authoring and editing of ''Think and Grow Rich''.

The formula was detailed further for home-study courses, including the seventeen-volume \"Mental Dynamite\" series ending 1941.\n\nHill said his philosophy was superior to others, and that its principles were responsible for Americans' successes.

Although he did not explicitly identify this secret in the book, he offered, 20 pages into the book: \n\"If you truly desire money so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. The object is to want money, and to be so determined to have it that you convince yourself that you will have it... You may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great quantities unless you work yourself into a white heat of desire for money, and actually believe you will possess it.\"  In the introduction Hill states of the \"secret\" that Andrew Carnegie 'carelessly tossed it into my mind', and that it also inspired [[Manuel L. Quezon]] of the Philippine Islands <!--(then Resident Commissioner of the Philippine Islands)--> to 'gain freedom for his people, and went on to lead them as its first president.' Although he mentions a 'burning desire for money' repeatedly throughout the book, he also suggests it is not in fact his \"secret\" at all. By contrast, at the end of his first book, [[The Law of Success]], nine years earlier, he identifies his secret as [[The Golden Rule]]: Only by working harmoniously in co-operation with other individuals or groups of individuals and thus creating value and benefit for them will one create sustainable achievement for oneself.\n\nHe presented the notion of a \"Definite Major Purpose\" as a challenge to his readers to ask themselves, \"In what do I truly believe?\"  According to Hill, \"98%\" of people had few or no strong beliefs, which made success unlikely.<ref name=\"Think\">{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Napoleon |title=Think and Grow Rich |page=viii |location=Chicago, Illinois |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0qAh2gHd4YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Think+and+Grow+Rich&cd=7#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Combined Registry Company |year=1937 |isbn=1-60506-930-2}}</ref>\n\nHill used a story of his son, Blair, who he says was an inspiration to him because although Blair was born without ears, and though his doctor told Hill his son would neither be able to hear nor speak, Blair grew up able to hear and speak almost normally. Hill reports that his son, during his last year of college, read chapter two of the manuscript of ''Think And Grow Rich'', discovered Hill's secret \"for himself\", and then inspired \"hundreds and thousands\" of people who could not hear or speak.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Napoleon |title=Think and Grow Rich |pages=11, 52\u201363 |location=Chicago, Illinois |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0qAh2gHd4YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Think+and+Grow+Rich&cd=7#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Combined Registry Company |year=1937 |isbn=1-60506-930-2 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1952 to 1962, Hill taught his ''Philosophy of Personal Achievement \u2013 Lectures on Science of Success'' in association with [[W.

With Peace of Mind'' (1967). He described them as unseen friends, unseen watchers, strange beings, and the [[Ascended Master|Great School of Masters]] that had been guarding him, and who maintain a \"school of wisdom\".  Hill states that the \"Master\" spoke to him audibly, revealing secret knowledge. Hill further insists that the Masters \"can disembody themselves and travel instantly to any place they choose in order to acquire essential knowledge, or to give knowledge directly, by voice, to anyone else.\" ''Grow Rich!

Napoleon Hill's collaboration with [[Andrew Carnegie]] has never been confirmed by Carnegie or the Carnegie estate, and Hill allegedly only started making claims of interviewing Carnegie after he had died. Aside from Hill's writings, there are no accounts of the meeting taking place.

During the next few years, Hill traveled through the country, returning to his habits from the prior decade of initiating various short-lived business ventures.\n\nDuring 1935, Hill's wife Florence filed for a divorce in [[Florida]].\n\n=== ''Think and Grow Rich'' ===\nDuring 1937, Hill published the best-selling book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'', which became Hill's best-known work. Hill's new wife Rosa Lee Beeland contributed substantially to the authoring and editing of ''Think and Grow Rich''. Hill's biographers would later say this book sold 20 million copies during 50 years, although as Richard Lingeman remarks in his brief biography, \"Alice Payne Hackett's '70 Years of Best Sellers' suggests the amount was considerably less.\"<ref name=\"Lingeman\" />\n\nWealthy once more, Hill re-initiated his lavish lifestyle and purchased a new estate in [[Mount Dora, Florida]].

The formula was detailed further for home-study courses, including the seventeen-volume \"Mental Dynamite\" series ending 1941.\n\nHill said his philosophy was superior to others, and that its principles were responsible for Americans' successes.

Although he did not explicitly identify this secret in the book, he offered, 20 pages into the book: \n\"If you truly desire money so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in convincing yourself that you will acquire it. The object is to want money, and to be so determined to have it that you convince yourself that you will have it... You may as well know, right here, that you can never have riches in great quantities unless you work yourself into a white heat of desire for money, and actually believe you will possess it.\"  In the introduction Hill states of the \"secret\" that Andrew Carnegie 'carelessly tossed it into my mind', and that it also inspired [[Manuel L. Quezon]] of the Philippine Islands <!--(then Resident Commissioner of the Philippine Islands)--> to 'gain freedom for his people, and went on to lead them as its first president.' Although he mentions a 'burning desire for money' repeatedly throughout the book, he also suggests it is not in fact his \"secret\" at all. By contrast, at the end of his first book, [[The Law of Success]], nine years earlier, he identifies his secret as [[The Golden Rule]]: Only by working harmoniously in co-operation with other individuals or groups of individuals and thus creating value and benefit for them will one create sustainable achievement for oneself.\n\nHe presented the notion of a \"Definite Major Purpose\" as a challenge to his readers to ask themselves, \"In what do I truly believe?\"  According to Hill, \"98%\" of people had few or no strong beliefs, which made success unlikely.<ref name=\"Think\">{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Napoleon |title=Think and Grow Rich |page=viii |location=Chicago, Illinois |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0qAh2gHd4YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Think+and+Grow+Rich&cd=7#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Combined Registry Company |year=1937 |isbn=1-60506-930-2}}</ref>\n\nHill used a story of his son, Blair, who he says was an inspiration to him because although Blair was born without ears, and though his doctor told Hill his son would neither be able to hear nor speak, Blair grew up able to hear and speak almost normally.

With Peace of Mind'' was allegedly influenced by Hill's spirit voices; Hill cites the \"Master\", saying, \"Much of what he said already has been presented to you in the chapters of this book or will follow in other chapters.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Napoleon |title=Think and Grow Rich |location=Chicago, Illinois |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0qAh2gHd4YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Think+and+Grow+Rich&cd=7#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Combined Registry Company |year=1937 |isbn=1-60506-930-2}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nNapoleon Hill died aged 87 on November 8, 1970.<ref>{{cite news|title=Napoleon Hill|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11491720/napoleon_hill_18831970/|newspaper=The Bee|date=November 10, 1970|page=7|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = June 5, 2017}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\nAside from charges of fraud, the authenticity of many of Hill's claims have been widely disputed. Napoleon Hill's collaboration with [[Andrew Carnegie]] has never been confirmed by Carnegie or the Carnegie estate, and Hill allegedly only started making claims of interviewing Carnegie after he had died. Aside from Hill's writings, there are no accounts of the meeting taking place. According to Andrew Carnegie biographer [[David Nasaw]] he said of the alleged meeting between Carnegie and Hill that he \"found no evidence of any sort that Carnegie and Hill ever met\" and \"I found no evidence that the book was authentic.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Novak |first1=Matt |title=The Untold Story of Napoleon Hill, the Greatest Self-Help Scammer of All Time |url=https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/the-untold-story-of-napoleon-hill-the-greatest-self-he-1789385645 |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOutside of Hill's own writings, and aside from briefly meeting [[Thomas Edison]] in 1923, the evidence is lacking for many of Hill's other claims of meeting other famous men. According to the official Napoleon Hill biography the reason for this is that the all the photos, letters from presidents, and endorsement letters from famous men were all lost in a fire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=J.

Napoleon Hill claimed to have aided [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] negotiate Germany's surrender in [[World War I]], but there is no known evidence. He claimed he helped F.D.R. write his [[fireside chats]] with no known evidence. He claimed to be an attorney although his official biography notes \"there is no record of his having actually performed legal services for anyone.\" There are no known records of Hill interviewing the famous men he claimed to have interviewed, such as [[Charles M. Schwab]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[John D. Rockefeller]], Edwin C. Barnes, and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Farnham |first1=Alan | date=7 August 1995 | title=Seamy Side Of A Self-Help Swami A New Biography Reveals That Napoleon Hill, Author Of Think & Grow Rich, Which Has Sold Ten Million Copies, Knew Failure Well. |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/08/07/205128/index.htm |website=Fortune |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHill's works were inspired by the philosophy of [[New Thought]] and the writings of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and are listed as New Thought reading.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKNYynQkccYC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=Occult+History+Mysticism+Shaped+dale+carnegie+napoleon+hill#v=onepage&q=Occult%20History%20Mysticism%20Shaped%20dale%20carnegie%20napoleon%20hill&f=false|title=Occult America: The Secret History of how Mysticism Shaped Our Nation|last=Horowitz|first=Mitch|date=January 1, 2009 |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=9780553806755|location=|pages=87}}</ref><ref>Starker, S.

Large, dark spots appear in rows along its back, becoming especially distinct at the center of the back where they are interspersed with smaller and paler spots. Bands of color occur toward the tip of the tail. The overall coloration is brownish in the nominate subspecies, ''V. panoptes panoptes'', and reddish in  ''V. panoptes rubidus''.<ref name=\"Storr1980\" />\n\n[[File:Argus Monitor and Lace Monitor.jpg|thumb|Argus monitor (left), lace monitor (right)]]\n\nThe individual size of the sexes differs greatly, with the female reaching an average total length of three feet (90&nbsp;cm), while the male reaches an average of 4\u20135 feet (120\u2013140&nbsp;cm). The larger subspecies is ''V. panoptes panoptes'' and the smaller one is ''V. panoptes horni''. It is a reasonably lean monitor and does not put on the bulk that its African cousins often do. Most Argus monitors are yellow in color, with a background of brown or dark tan, but their color often varies on an individual basis or on their place of origin.\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Monitor1.jpg|thumb|Argus monitor \"tripod\" stance]]\nThe Argus monitor is a versatile [[predator]] and inhabits a large variety of [[biomes]] and [[habitat]]s. They are primarily terrestrial, meaning they spend a great deal of time on the ground. This species is an avid digger and will dig large burrows or take over an already existing burrow, where they spend a sizable portion of their time. Despite this, they will eagerly [[forage]] in trees and in the water. These large lizards are quite fast and will run up to 100 yards/meters to the nearest tree or burrow when they are chased. The Argus monitor is [[riparian]] in habits and as such, it can usually be found around a permanent source of water. The Argus will often \"tripod\" in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] and in the wild, raising up on their hind legs and supporting themselves with the tail. This unusual behavior is used to spot potential prey or enemies from a distance or when they are threatened. They exhibit this behavior regularly in captivity.  This habit provides them a unique characteristic that separates them from most other monitors.\n\nIn [[Arnhem Land]], they lay 6 to 13 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] between January and February.<ref name=\"Ehmann, Harald 1992 p. 152\" />\n\nIts [[prey]] consists of almost anything that it can overpower. This includes [[fish]], [[crab]]s, small [[birds]], [[rodents]], [[insects]] and even other [[Monitor lizard|monitors]]. The Argus monitor frequently preys on the [[dwarf monitor]]s that it shares its range with. [[Spiny-tailed goanna]]s and [[Kimberley rock monitor]]s are eaten regularly. Argus monitors have great senses, with smell being the most acute. Like all monitors, the Argus has a forked tongue and a [[vomeronasal organ]] in the roof of its mouth. It uses this organ in the same manner as snakes do and can often be seen flicking their tongues in search of a meal.\n<!-- Parthogenesis suspected: Amphibia-Reptilia 26:507 -->\n\nRecent studies suggest that the [[cane toad]] infestation, a novel and toxic species, has severely damaged the population structure of Argus monitors within the [[Top End]]. It is estimated that numbers have dropped by as much as 90% in many areas.<ref name=\"ABCnews2010\" />\n\n==In captivity==\nMany individuals of this species are captive bred as a conservation effort against poisoning from the cane toad infestation of the species\u2019 native range. They hunt for prey by keying in on movement, chasing it down and overpowering it. Argus monitors are fed insects, fish and mice. ''V. panoptes'' are husky lizards that can be a challenge to physically handle. They do not like to be restrained, and can use their sharp claws in their attempts to squirm free. If left to wander freely on open ground, their ability to suddenly flee makes escape likely.<ref name=\"Burokas\" /> ''V. panoptes'' prefer to bask each morning and return to bask as needed to maintain optimal body temperatures at {{convert|80|to|90|F|C|1}}.

It is used as a sign of respect and a greeting in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Indonesia]], also used among [[East Asia]]n Buddhists, Taoists and Shintoists and amongst [[yoga]] practitioners and adherents of similar traditions. The gesture is incorporated into many yoga [[asanas]], and is used for worship in many [[Eastern religions]].\n\nThe [[modern yoga]] pose '''pra\u1e47\u0101m\u0101sana''' ({{lang-sa|\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0928|links=no}}) consists of standing with the hands in A\u00f1jali Mudr\u0101.\n\n===Etymology===\n''Anjali'' is [[Sanskrit]] for \"divine offering\", \"a gesture of reverence\", \"benediction\", \"salutation\", and is derived from ''anj'', meaning \"to honour or celebrate\".<ref name=yj1 />\n\n''[[Mudra]]'' means \"seal\" or \"sign\". The meaning of the phrase is thus \"salutation seal\".<ref name=\"Rea 2007\"/>\n\nThe gesture is also known as ''hrdayanjali mudra'' meaning \"reverence to the heart seal\" (from ''hrd'', meaning \"heart\") and ''atmanjali mudra'' meaning \"reverence to the self seal\" (from ''atman'', meaning \"self\").<ref name=yj1/>\n\n===Description===\n[[File:Indian sadhu performing namaste.jpg|thumb|left|A [[sadhu]] performing Anjali Mudra at his crown chakra in front of a sculptured figure in the same posture]]\nAnjali mudra is performed by pressing the palms of the hands together.  The fingers are together with fingertips pointing up.  The hands are pressed together firmly and evenly.<ref name=yj1/>\n[[File:Namaskar-India.jpg|thumb|Namaskar in India]]\n\nIn the most common form of anjali mudra, the hands are held at the [[Anahata|heart chakra]] with thumbs resting lightly against the [[sternum]].<ref name=yj1 />  The gesture may also be performed at the [[Ajna]] or [[brow chakra]] with thumb tips resting against the \"third eye\" or at the [[Sahasrara|crown chakra]] (above the head).  In some yoga postures, the hands are placed in anjali mudra position to one side of the body or behind the back.\n\nAnjali mudra is normally accompanied by a slight bowing of the head.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n===Symbolic meaning===\nAnjali mudra has the same meaning as the Sanskrit greeting ''[[Namaste]]'' and can be performed while saying ''Namaste'' or ''Pranam'', or in place of vocalizing the word.\n\nThe gesture is used for both greetings and farewells, but carries a deeper significance than a simple \"hello\" or \"goodbye\".  The joining together of the palms is said to provide connection between the right and left hemispheres of the brain and represents unification.<ref name=yj1 /><ref name=\"Rea 2007\"/> This yoking is symbolic of the practitioner's connection with the divine in all things. Hence, anjali mudra honours both the self and the other.<ref name=\"Rea 2007\"/>\n\n===Physical benefits===\nAnjali mudra is performed as part of a physical yoga practice with an aim to achieving several benefits.  It is a \"centering pose\" which, according to practitioners, helps to alleviate mental stress and anxiety and is therefore used to assist the practitioner in achieving focus and coming into a meditative state.<ref name=yj1 />\n\nThe physical execution of the pose helps to promote flexibility in the hands, wrists, fingers and arms.<ref name=yj1 />\n\n===Use in full-body asanas===\nWhile anjali mudra may be performed by itself from any seated or standing posture, the gesture is also incorporated into physical yoga practice as part of many full-body asanas, including:\n\n* [[Anjaneyasana]] (lunge) \u2013 with arms overhead<ref>{{cite web|title=Low Lunge|publisher=[[Yoga Journal]]|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2494|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404091024/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2494|archive-date=2009-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Hanumanasana]] (monkey pose)<ref>{{cite web|title=Monkey Pose|publisher=[[Yoga Journal]]|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/874|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404091049/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/874|archive-date=2009-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Garland Pose|Malasana]] (garland pose)<ref>{{cite web|title=Garland Pose|publisher=[[Yoga Journal]]|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2472|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327145536/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2472|archive-date=2009-03-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Matsyasana]] (fish pose) \u2013 an advanced variant<ref>{{cite web|title=Fish Pose |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/786 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618074755/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/786 |archivedate=18 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Prasarita Padottanasana]] (wide-legged forward bend) \u2013 an advanced variant with hands behind the back<ref>{{cite web|title=Wide-Legged Forward Bend |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/693 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611095508/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/693 |archivedate=11 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Rajakapotasana]] (Pigeon Pose/King Pigeon Pose) \u2013 anjali mudra in Pigeon pose<ref>{{cite web|title=Pigeon Pose|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/pigeon-pose/|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926073722/http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/pigeon-pose/|archive-date=2014-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tadasana]]/samasthiti (mountain pose) \u2013 a variant of the pose used during [[sun salutation]] sequences<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain Pose|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/492|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722154021/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/492|archive-date=2009-07-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Utkatasana]] (chair pose, literally \"fierce pose\"), arms overhead\n* [[Urdhva Hastasana]] (upward salute/extended mountain pose) \u2013 arms overhead<ref>{{cite web|title=Upward Salute|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2489|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225707/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2489|archive-date=2009-02-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Virabhadrasana I]] (warrior I) \u2013 arms overhead<ref>{{cite web|title=Warrior I |publisher=Yoga Journal |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1708 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531091720/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1708 |archivedate=31 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Vrikshasana]] (tree pose)<ref>{{cite web |title=Tree Pose |publisher=Yoga Journal |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502125549/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496 |archivedate=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThe gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of [[Asia]] and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated.<ref name=ying/> ''Namaste'' or ''namaskar'' is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger.<ref name=jonesryan/> In some contexts, ''Namaste'' is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness.<ref>Joseph Shaules (2007), Deep Culture: The Hidden Challenges of Global Living, {{ISBN|978-1847690166}}, pp. 68\u201370</ref>\n\n''Namaskar'' is also part of the 16 [[upachara]]s used inside temples or any place of formal [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship).

In [[Kannada language|Kannada]], Sharanu (\u0cb6\u0cb0\u0ca3\u0cc1) is used in Northern Karnataka and Namask\u0101ra (\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb0) for singular and Namaskaragalu (\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cc1) is widely used in the rest of Karnataka for Namaste.

The gesture is incorporated into many yoga [[asanas]], and is used for worship in many [[Eastern religions]].\n\nThe [[modern yoga]] pose '''pra\u1e47\u0101m\u0101sana''' ({{lang-sa|\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0938\u0928|links=no}}) consists of standing with the hands in A\u00f1jali Mudr\u0101.\n\n===Etymology===\n''Anjali'' is [[Sanskrit]] for \"divine offering\", \"a gesture of reverence\", \"benediction\", \"salutation\", and is derived from ''anj'', meaning \"to honour or celebrate\".<ref name=yj1 />\n\n''[[Mudra]]'' means \"seal\" or \"sign\". The meaning of the phrase is thus \"salutation seal\".<ref name=\"Rea 2007\"/>\n\nThe gesture is also known as ''hrdayanjali mudra'' meaning \"reverence to the heart seal\" (from ''hrd'', meaning \"heart\") and ''atmanjali mudra'' meaning \"reverence to the self seal\" (from ''atman'', meaning \"self\").<ref name=yj1/>\n\n===Description===\n[[File:Indian sadhu performing namaste.jpg|thumb|left|A [[sadhu]] performing Anjali Mudra at his crown chakra in front of a sculptured figure in the same posture]]\nAnjali mudra is performed by pressing the palms of the hands together.  The fingers are together with fingertips pointing up.  The hands are pressed together firmly and evenly.<ref name=yj1/>\n[[File:Namaskar-India.jpg|thumb|Namaskar in India]]\n\nIn the most common form of anjali mudra, the hands are held at the [[Anahata|heart chakra]] with thumbs resting lightly against the [[sternum]].<ref name=yj1 />  The gesture may also be performed at the [[Ajna]] or [[brow chakra]] with thumb tips resting against the \"third eye\" or at the [[Sahasrara|crown chakra]] (above the head).  In some yoga postures, the hands are placed in anjali mudra position to one side of the body or behind the back.\n\nAnjali mudra is normally accompanied by a slight bowing of the head.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n===Symbolic meaning===\nAnjali mudra has the same meaning as the Sanskrit greeting ''[[Namaste]]'' and can be performed while saying ''Namaste'' or ''Pranam'', or in place of vocalizing the word.\n\nThe gesture is used for both greetings and farewells, but carries a deeper significance than a simple \"hello\" or \"goodbye\".  The joining together of the palms is said to provide connection between the right and left hemispheres of the brain and represents unification.<ref name=yj1 /><ref name=\"Rea 2007\"/> This yoking is symbolic of the practitioner's connection with the divine in all things. Hence, anjali mudra honours both the self and the other.<ref name=\"Rea 2007\"/>\n\n===Physical benefits===\nAnjali mudra is performed as part of a physical yoga practice with an aim to achieving several benefits.  It is a \"centering pose\" which, according to practitioners, helps to alleviate mental stress and anxiety and is therefore used to assist the practitioner in achieving focus and coming into a meditative state.<ref name=yj1 />\n\nThe physical execution of the pose helps to promote flexibility in the hands, wrists, fingers and arms.<ref name=yj1 />\n\n===Use in full-body asanas===\nWhile anjali mudra may be performed by itself from any seated or standing posture, the gesture is also incorporated into physical yoga practice as part of many full-body asanas, including:\n\n* [[Anjaneyasana]] (lunge) \u2013 with arms overhead<ref>{{cite web|title=Low Lunge|publisher=[[Yoga Journal]]|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2494|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404091024/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2494|archive-date=2009-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Hanumanasana]] (monkey pose)<ref>{{cite web|title=Monkey Pose|publisher=[[Yoga Journal]]|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/874|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404091049/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/874|archive-date=2009-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Garland Pose|Malasana]] (garland pose)<ref>{{cite web|title=Garland Pose|publisher=[[Yoga Journal]]|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2472|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327145536/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2472|archive-date=2009-03-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Matsyasana]] (fish pose) \u2013 an advanced variant<ref>{{cite web|title=Fish Pose |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/786 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618074755/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/786 |archivedate=18 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Prasarita Padottanasana]] (wide-legged forward bend) \u2013 an advanced variant with hands behind the back<ref>{{cite web|title=Wide-Legged Forward Bend |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/693 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611095508/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/693 |archivedate=11 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Rajakapotasana]] (Pigeon Pose/King Pigeon Pose) \u2013 anjali mudra in Pigeon pose<ref>{{cite web|title=Pigeon Pose|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/pigeon-pose/|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926073722/http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/pigeon-pose/|archive-date=2014-09-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tadasana]]/samasthiti (mountain pose) \u2013 a variant of the pose used during [[sun salutation]] sequences<ref>{{cite web|title=Mountain Pose|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/492|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722154021/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/492|archive-date=2009-07-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Utkatasana]] (chair pose, literally \"fierce pose\"), arms overhead\n* [[Urdhva Hastasana]] (upward salute/extended mountain pose) \u2013 arms overhead<ref>{{cite web|title=Upward Salute|publisher=Yoga Journal|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2489|accessdate=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225707/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/2489|archive-date=2009-02-26|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Virabhadrasana I]] (warrior I) \u2013 arms overhead<ref>{{cite web|title=Warrior I |publisher=Yoga Journal |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1708 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531091720/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/1708 |archivedate=31 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Vrikshasana]] (tree pose)<ref>{{cite web |title=Tree Pose |publisher=Yoga Journal |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496 |accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502125549/http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/496 |archivedate=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThe gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of [[Asia]] and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated.<ref name=ying/> ''Namaste'' or ''namaskar'' is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger.<ref name=jonesryan/> In some contexts, ''Namaste'' is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness.<ref>Joseph Shaules (2007), Deep Culture: The Hidden Challenges of Global Living, {{ISBN|978-1847690166}}, pp. 68\u201370</ref>\n\n''Namaskar'' is also part of the 16 [[upachara]]s used inside temples or any place of formal [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship).

In [[Nepal]], people generally use Namask\u0101ra for greeting and respecting their elders. In [[Odia language|Odia]] Namaste is also known as \u0b28\u0b2e\u0b38\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b3e\u0b30 (namask\u0101r) General greeting. In [[Kannada language|Kannada]], Sharanu (\u0cb6\u0cb0\u0ca3\u0cc1) is used in Northern Karnataka and Namask\u0101ra (\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb0) for singular and Namaskaragalu (\u0ca8\u0cae\u0cb8\u0ccd\u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb0\u0c97\u0cb3\u0cc1) is widely used in the rest of Karnataka for Namaste. In [[Telugu language|Telugu]], Namaste is also known as Dandamu (\u0c26\u0c02\u0c21\u0c2e\u0c41) or namaskaram (\u0c28\u0c2e\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c02) for singular and Dandaalu or namaskaralu for plural form. Pranamamu (\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c23\u0c3e\u0c2e\u0c2e\u0c41) is also used in formal Telugu.  In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the Namaste gesture is expressed as N\u014dm\u014dshkar (\u09a8\u09ae\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09be\u09b0), and as Pr\u014dn\u00e4m (Bengali: \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a3\u09be\u09ae) informally.

In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Namaste is known as ''Vanakkam'' (\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bae\u0bcd) which is derived from the root word ''vanangu'' (\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1) meaning ''to bow'' or ''to greet''. In [[Malayalam]], Namast\u0113 (\u0d28\u0d2e\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d47) and Namask\u0101ram (\u0d28\u0d2e\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d02) are used synonymously.

The castle is very small, with a length of only 100 meters. and consists of terraces built along the contour of the hill, protected by clay walls and dry moats. Vulnerable portions of the ramparts were faced with cut stone. The route to the [[inner bailey]] zigzagged through the second and third bailey, with gates in between. The top of the castle overlooks the anchorage of Uchiura, which was a strategic for the [[Late H\u014dj\u014d clan]] and later the [[Takeda clan]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 1570s, the Late H\u014dj\u014d clan based at [[Odawara Castle]] in [[Sagami province]] and the [[Takeda clan]] from [[Kai Province]] went to war over the disputed territories of the former [[Imagawa clan]] in [[Suruga Province]]. The Takeda clan occupied most of Suruga from 1569 and had inherited the Imagawa navy; however the H\u014dj\u014d clan also had a powerful navy, with which it controlled [[Sagami Bay]] and waged war against the [[Satomi clan]] of [[Awa Province (Chiba)|Awa Province]]. In the 1570s, the Takeda reached an agreement with the Satomi, which allowed them to shift their fleet to Suruga Province, and constructed Nagahama Castle, on the border of [[Izu Province|Izu]] and Suruga as a base of operations. Although the H\u014dj\u014d clan was unable to destroy the Takeda navy, their fleet was able to keep the Takeda fleet largely bound to port.\n\nAfter the fall of the Takeda clan in 1582, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came into conflict with [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Hideyoshi's forces included the [[Kuki clan]] based in [[Shima Province]] and the [[Murakami clan]] based in the [[Seto Inland Sea]], the two strongest naval powers in Sengoku Japan. During the 1590 [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Siege of Odawara]], the H\u014dj\u014d navy faced overwhelming odds and surrendered at Nagahama Castle and at [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]].

The castle is very small, with a length of only 100 meters. and consists of terraces built along the contour of the hill, protected by clay walls and dry moats. Vulnerable portions of the ramparts were faced with cut stone. The route to the [[inner bailey]] zigzagged through the second and third bailey, with gates in between. The top of the castle overlooks the anchorage of Uchiura, which was a strategic for the [[Late H\u014dj\u014d clan]] and later the [[Takeda clan]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 1570s, the Late H\u014dj\u014d clan based at [[Odawara Castle]] in [[Sagami province]] and the [[Takeda clan]] from [[Kai Province]] went to war over the disputed territories of the former [[Imagawa clan]] in [[Suruga Province]]. The Takeda clan occupied most of Suruga from 1569 and had inherited the Imagawa navy; however the H\u014dj\u014d clan also had a powerful navy, with which it controlled [[Sagami Bay]] and waged war against the [[Satomi clan]] of [[Awa Province (Chiba)|Awa Province]]. In the 1570s, the Takeda reached an agreement with the Satomi, which allowed them to shift their fleet to Suruga Province, and constructed Nagahama Castle, on the border of [[Izu Province|Izu]] and Suruga as a base of operations. Although the H\u014dj\u014d clan was unable to destroy the Takeda navy, their fleet was able to keep the Takeda fleet largely bound to port.\n\nAfter the fall of the Takeda clan in 1582, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came into conflict with [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Hideyoshi's forces included the [[Kuki clan]] based in [[Shima Province]] and the [[Murakami clan]] based in the [[Seto Inland Sea]], the two strongest naval powers in Sengoku Japan. During the 1590 [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Siege of Odawara]], the H\u014dj\u014d navy faced overwhelming odds and surrendered at Nagahama Castle and at [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]]. Nagahama Castle was abandoned soon afterwards.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book| title=Castles in Japan| last=Schmorleitz| first=Morton S.| year=1974| pages=[https://archive.org/details/castlesinjapan00schm/page/144 144\u2013145]| publisher=Charles E.
