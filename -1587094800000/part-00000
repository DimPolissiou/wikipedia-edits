Stockton''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=small|OM|PC|FRS}} (10&nbsp;February 1894&nbsp;\u2013 29 December 1986) was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1957 to 1963. Dubbed \"[[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]]\", he was known for his [[pragmatism]], wit and unflappability.\n\nMacmillan served in the [[Grenadier Guards]] during the First World War. He was wounded three times, most severely in September 1916 during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk, and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life. After the war Macmillan joined his family business, then entered Parliament at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] for the northern industrial constituency of [[Stockton-on-Tees (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockton-on-Tees]]. After losing his seat in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]], he regained it in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees, and against [[appeasement]]. Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Macmillan then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Churchill's successor [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]]. When Eden resigned in 1957 following the [[Suez Crisis]], Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]]. As a [[One-nation conservatism|One Nation Tory]] of the [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraelian]] tradition, haunted by memories of the [[Great Depression]], he believed in the [[Welfare state|post-war settlement]] and the necessity of a [[mixed economy]], championing a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] strategy of [[public investment]] to [[demand management|maintain demand]] and pursuing [[Tory corporatism|corporatist]] policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth. Benefiting from favourable international conditions,{{sfn|Middleton|1997|pages=422\u201323}} he presided over an [[Economic history of Britain|age of affluence]], marked by low unemployment and high\u2014if uneven\u2014growth. In his [[Bedford]] speech of July 1957 he told the nation they had 'never had it so good',{{sfn|Middleton|1997|p=422}} but warned of the dangers of inflation, summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s.<ref>Peter Hennessy, ''Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties'' (London: Allen Lane, 2006), pp. 533\u201334.</ref> The Conservatives were re-elected in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] with an increased majority. \n\nIn international affairs, Macmillan rebuilt the [[Special Relationship]] with the United States from the wreckage of the [[Suez Crisis]] (of which he had been one of the architects), and facilitated the [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Reconfiguring the nation's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age, he ended [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], strengthened the [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear forces]] by acquiring [[UGM-27 Polaris#British Polaris|Polaris]], and pioneered the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]] with the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence, he sought a new role for Britain in Europe, but his unwillingness to disclose [[Nuclear weapons of the United States|United States nuclear secrets]] to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom's entry into the [[European Economic Community]].<ref>Richard Lamb, ''The Macmillan Years 1957\u20131963: The Emerging Truth'' (London: John Murray, 1995), pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Near the end of his premiership, his government was rocked by the [[John Vassall|Vassall]] and [[Profumo affair|Profumo]] scandals, which to some, especially the [[Anti-establishment|rebellious youth]] of the 1960s, seemed to symbolise the moral decay of the British establishment.<ref name=\"Leitch\">{{citation |last=Leitch |first=David |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/the-spy-who-rocked-a-world-of-privilege-1313565.html |title=The spy who rocked a world of privilege |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 December 1996 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804024128/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/the-spy-who-rocked-a-world-of-privilege-1313565.html |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> After his resignation, Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an [[wikt:elder statesman|elder statesman]].

He reported directly to the Prime Minister instead of to the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Eden]].

This caused friction with Eden and the Foreign Office.<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 195\u201399</ref> He was based at [[Caserta]] for the rest of the war. He was appointed UK High Commissioner for the Advisory Council for Italy late in 1943.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 201</ref> He visited London in October 1943 and again clashed with Eden. Eden appointed [[Duff Cooper]] as Ambassador to France (still under German occupation) and [[Noel Charles]] as Ambassador to Italy to reduce Macmillan's influence.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 210</ref> In May 1944 Macmillan infuriated Eden by demanding an early peace treaty with Italy (at that time a pro-Allied regime under [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] held some power in the southern, liberated, part of Italy), a move which Churchill favoured. In June 1944 he argued for a British-led thrust up the [[Ljubljana Gap]] into Central Europe (Operation \"Armpit\") instead of the planned diversion of US and Free French forces to the South of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]). This proposal impressed Churchill and [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|General Alexander]], but did not meet with American approval. Eden sent out Robert Dixon to abolish the job of Resident Minister, there being then no job for Macmillan back in the UK, but he managed to prevent his job being abolished. Churchill visited Italy in August 1944. On 14 September 1944 Macmillan was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Allied Central Commission for Italy (in succession to General Macfarlane). He continued to be British Minister Resident at Allied Headquarters and British Political adviser to [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|\"Jumbo\" Wilson]], now Supreme Commander, Mediterranean. On 10 November 1944 he was appointed Acting President of the Allied Commission (the Supreme Commander being President).<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 218\u201322</ref>\n\nMacmillan visited Greece on 11 December 1944. As the Germans had withdrawn, British troops under [[Ronald Scobie|General Scobie]] had deployed to Athens, but there were concerns that the largely pro-communist Greek resistance, [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and its military wing [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]], would take power (see [[Dekemvriana]]) or come into conflict with British troops. Macmillan rode in a tank and was under sniper fire at the British Embassy. Despite the hostility of large sections of British and American opinion, who were sympathetic to the guerillas and hostile to what was seen as imperialist behaviour, he persuaded a reluctant Churchill, who visited Athens later in the month, to accept [[Damaskinos of Athens|Archbishop Damaskinos]] as Regent on behalf of the exiled [[George II of Greece|King George]]. A [[Varkiza agreement|truce]] was negotiated in January 1945, enabling a pro-British regime to remain in power, as Churchill had demanded in the [[Percentages agreement]] the previous autumn.<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 230\u201340</ref><ref>In 1947 the US would take over Britain's role as \"protector\" of Greece and Turkey, to keep the Soviets out of the Mediterranean, the so-called \"[[Truman Doctrine]]\"</ref>\n\nMacmillan was also the minister advising [[Charles Keightley|General Keightley]] of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]], the senior [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] commander in Austria responsible for [[Operation Keelhaul]], which included the forced repatriation of up to 70,000 prisoners of war to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1945. The deportations and Macmillan's involvement later became a source of controversy because of the harsh treatment meted out to [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and anti-partisans by the receiving countries, and because in the confusion V Corps went beyond the terms agreed at [[Yalta conference|Yalta]] and [[Allied Forces Headquarters]] directives by repatriating 4000 [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|White Russian troops]] and 11,000 civilian family members, who could not properly be regarded as Soviet citizens.{{sfn|Horne|2008|pp=251\u201386}}<ref>Sir [[Curtis Keeble]], 'Macmillan and the Soviet Union', in Richard Aldous and Sabine Lee (eds), ''Harold Macmillan: Aspects of a Political Life'' (London: Macmillan, 1999), pp. 199\u2013200.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n17/ferdinand-mount/too-obviously-cleverer |title=Too Obviously Cleverer |author=Ferdinand Mount |date=8 September 2011 |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=33 |issue=17 |accessdate=15 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121193333/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n17/ferdinand-mount/too-obviously-cleverer |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy-all |author-link=Ferdinand Mount }}</ref>\n\n===Air Secretary (1945)===\nMacmillan toyed with an offer to succeed [[Duff Cooper]] as MP for the safe Conservative seat of [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster St George's]].<ref name=\"Horne 1988, p. 243\"/> Criticised locally for his long absence, he suggested that Lady Dorothy stand for Stockton in 1945, as she had been nursing the seat for five years.

Macmillan thought at first that Housing, which ranked 13 out of 16 in the Cabinet list, was a poisoned chalice, writing in his diary (28 October 1951) that it was \"not my cup of tea at all ... I really haven't a clue how to set about the job\".

In April 1953 Beaverbrook encouraged Macmillan to think that in a future leadership contest he might emerge in a dead heat between Eden and Butler, as the young Beaverbrook (Max Aitken as he had been at the time) had helped [[Bonar Law]] to do in 1911.<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 257\u201358</ref> In July 1953 Macmillan considered postponing his gall bladder operation in case Churchill, who had just suffered a serious stroke while Eden was also in hospital, had to step down.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 259</ref>\n\nMacmillan achieved his housing target by the end of 1953, a year ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=139}}<ref name=\"HNDM\">{{cite news |title=The Housing Total Was 318,779 |work=Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail |date=5 February 1954 |accessdate=8 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000378/19540205/004/0001| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n===Defence Minister (1954\u201355)===\n[[File:Churchillcabinet1955.png|thumb|right|300px| Churchill's Cabinet, 1955 (Macmillan sitting on the far left)]]\nMacmillan was [[Secretary of State for Defence|Minister of Defence]] from October 1954, but found his authority restricted by Churchill's personal involvement.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=143}} In the opinion of ''[[The Economist]]'': 'He gave the impression that his own undoubted capacity for imaginative running of his own show melted way when an august superior was breathing down his neck.'<ref>''[[The Economist]]'' (16 April 1955).</ref>\n\nA major theme of his tenure at Defence was the ministry's growing reliance on the nuclear deterrent, in the view of some critics, to the detriment of conventional forces.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|pages=144\u201345}} The Defence White Paper of February 1955, announcing the decision to produce the [[Teller-Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]], received bipartisan support.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=145}}\n\n\"It breaks my heart to see the lion-hearted Churchill begin to sink into a sort of [[Philippe Petain|Petain]]\", Macmillan wrote in his diary as the Prime Minister's mental and physical powers visibly decayed.

He insisted on being \"undisputed head of the home front\" and that Eden's de facto deputy [[Rab Butler]], whom he was replacing as Chancellor, not have the title \"Deputy Prime Minister\" and not be treated as senior to him. He even tried (in vain) to demand that Salisbury, not Butler, should preside over the Cabinet in Eden's absence. Macmillan later claimed in his memoirs that he had still expected Butler, his junior by eight years, to succeed Eden, but correspondence with [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] at the time makes clear that Macmillan was very much thinking of the succession. As early as January 1956 he told Eden's press secretary William Clark that it would be \"interesting to see how long Anthony can stay in the saddle\".<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 261\u201362, 264</ref>\n\nMacmillan planned to reverse the 6d cut in income tax which Butler had made a year previously, but backed off after a \"frank talk\" with Butler, who threatened resignation, on 28 March 1956. He settled for spending cuts instead, and himself threatened resignation until he was allowed to cut bread and milk subsidies, something the Cabinet had not permitted Butler to do.<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 264\u201365</ref>\n\nOne of his innovations at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] was the introduction of [[premium bonds]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/18/newsid_4762000/4762748.stm 18 April 1956: Macmillan unveils premium bond scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106130300/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/18/newsid_4762000/4762748.stm |date=6 January 2017 }}, BBC News, 'On This Day 1950\u20132005'.</ref> announced in his budget of 17 April 1956.{{sfn|Horne|2008|p=383}} Although the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Opposition initially decried them as a 'squalid raffle', they proved an immediate hit with the public, with \u00a31,000 won in the first prize draw in June 1957.\n\n====Suez====\nIn November 1956 Britain invaded [[Egypt]] in collusion with France and Israel in the [[Suez Crisis]].

The Egyptian government, which came to be dominated by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], was opposed to the British military presence in the [[Arab World]]. The Egyptian nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal]] by Nasser on 26 July 1956 prompted the British government and the French government of [[Guy Mollet]] to commence plans for invading Egypt, regaining the canal, and toppling Nasser. Macmillan wrote in his diary: \"If Nasser 'gets away with it', we are done for. The whole Arab world will despise us ... [[Nuri al-Said|Nuri]] [es-Said, British-backed Prime Minister of Iraq] and our friends will fall. It may well be the end of British influence and strength forever. So, in the last resort, we must use force and defy opinion, here and overseas\".<ref>Bertjan Verbeek, ''Decision-making in Great Britain during the Suez crisis'' (2003) p. 95</ref>\n\nMacmillan threatened to resign if force was not used against Nasser.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 265</ref> He was heavily involved in the secret planning of the invasion with France and Israel. It was he who first suggested collusion with Israel.{{sfn|Beckett|2006|p=74}} On 5 August 1956 Macmillan met Churchill at Chartwell, and told him that the government's plan for simply regaining control of the canal was not enough and suggested involving Israel, recording in his diary for that day: \"Surely, if we landed we must seek out the Egyptian forces; destroy them; and bring down Nasser's government. Churchill seemed to agree with all this.\"<ref>Toye, Richard ''Churchill's Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made'' (2010) p. 304</ref> Macmillan knew President Eisenhower well, but misjudged his strong opposition to a military solution. Macmillan met Eisenhower privately on 25 September 1956 and convinced himself that the US would not oppose the invasion,{{sfn|Beckett|2006|pp=73\u201374}} despite the misgivings of the British Ambassador, Sir Roger Makins, who was also present. Macmillan failed to heed a warning from Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] that whatever the British government did should wait until after the US presidential election on 6 November, and failed to report Dulles' remarks to Eden.\n\nThe treasury was his portfolio, but he did not recognise the financial disaster that could result from US government actions. Sterling was draining out of the Bank of England at an alarming rate, and it was getting worse. The canal was blocked by the Egyptians, and most oil shipments were delayed as tankers had to go around Africa. The US government refused any financial help until Britain withdrew its forces from Egypt. When he did realise this, he changed his mind and called for withdrawal on US terms, while exaggerating the financial crisis.<ref name=\"Diane B. Kunz 1991 pp 130\">Diane B. Kunz, ''The Economic Diplomacy of the Suez Crisis'' (1991) pp. 130\u201340</ref> On 6 November Macmillan informed the Cabinet that Britain had lost $370m in the first few days of November alone.<ref>Howard 1987, p. 237</ref> Faced with Macmillan's prediction of doom, the cabinet had no choice but to accept these terms and withdraw. The Canal remained in Egyptian hands, and Nasser's government continued its support of Arab and African national resistance movements opposed to the British and French presence in the region and on the continent.<ref name=\"Diane B. Kunz 1991 pp 130\"/>\n\nIn later life Macmillan was open about his failure to read Eisenhower's thoughts correctly and much regretted the damage done to Anglo-American relations, but always maintained that the Anglo-French military response to the nationalisation of the Canal had been for the best.<ref>Williams, ''Harold Macmillan'' (2009) p. 267</ref> D. R. Thorpe rejects the charge that Macmillan deliberately played false over Suez (i.e. encouraged Eden to attack in order to destroy him as Prime Minister), noting that Macmillan privately put the chances of success at 51\u201349.<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 356</ref>\n\n====Succession to Eden====\nBritain's humiliation at the hands of the US caused deep anger among Conservative MPs. After the ceasefire a motion on the Order Paper attacking the US for \"gravely endangering the Atlantic Alliance\" attracted the signatures of over a hundred MPs.<ref>Howard 1987, p. 239</ref>\nMacmillan tried, but failed, to see Eisenhower (who was also refusing to see Foreign Secretary [[Selwyn Lloyd]]) behind Butler's and Eden's back. Macmillan had a number of meetings with [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|US Ambassador]] [[Winthrop Aldrich]], in which he said that if he were Prime Minister the US Administration would find him much more amenable. Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November. Eisenhower spoke highly of Macmillan (\"A straight, fine man, and so far as he is concerned, the outstanding one of the British he served with during the war\").<ref>Howard 1987, p. 242</ref><ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 352\u201353 Eisenhower said these words in a meeting with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[George M. Humphrey|Humphrey]] (who was pro-Butler), [[Under Secretary of State]] [[Herbert Hoover, Jr.|Hoover]] and [[White House Office of the Staff Secretary|Staff Secretary]] [[Andrew Goodpaster]]. It is unclear whether there was ''direct'' pressure from the US Administration for Macmillan to be chosen, or rather whether being the candidate best placed to rebuild bridges with the Americans was simply another reason why leading Conservatives preferred him to Butler. Published accounts do not agree about the date of the meeting. Williams (2008, p. 270) lists it as happening on 20 November, a date repeated in Michael Jago's 2015 biography of Rab Butler. Macmillan's other recent biographer D. R. Thorpe gives it as 24 ''December'', presumably an error as the footnote refers to Eisenhower's papers for November 1956, while in his biography of Anthony Eden (2003, p. 539) Thorpe gives it as 24 November.</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just announced British withdrawal, addressed the [[1922 committee]] (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by [[Enoch Powell]] as \"one of the most horrible things that I remember in politics ... (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old [[Actor-manager|actor manager]] succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting.\" He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be \"Greeks in the Roman Empire\", and according to [[Philip Goodhart]]'s recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote \"I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it was all I intended to do\". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) that he planned to retire and go to the Lords.<ref>Howard 1987, pp. 240\u201341</ref><ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 353\u201354</ref> He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 269</ref>\n\nButler later recorded that during his period as acting Head of Government at Number Ten, he noticed constant comings and goings of ministers to Macmillan's study in Number 11 next door\u2014and that those who attended all seemed to receive promotions when Macmillan became Prime Minister. Macmillan had opposed Eden's trip to Jamaica and told Butler (15 December, the day after Eden's return) that younger members of the Cabinet wanted Eden out.<ref>Howard 1987, p. 244</ref> Macmillan argued at Cabinet on 4 January that Suez should be regarded as a \"strategic retreat\" like [[Battle of Mons|Mons]] or [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. This did not meet with Eden's approval at Cabinet on 7 January.<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 358</ref>\n\nHis political standing destroyed, Eden resigned on grounds of ill health on 9 January 1957.{{sfn|Beckett|2006|pp=77\u201378}} At that time the Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for selecting a new leader, and [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] appointed Macmillan Prime Minister after taking advice from [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|the Marquess of Salisbury]], who had asked the Cabinet individually for their opinions, all but two or three opting for Macmillan. This surprised some observers who had expected that Eden's deputy [[Rab Butler]] would be chosen.<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 361\u201362</ref> The political situation after Suez was so desperate that on taking office on 10 January he told the Queen he could not guarantee his government would last \"six weeks\"\u2014though ultimately he would be in charge of the government for more than six years.<ref>Harold Macmillan, ''The Macmillan Diaries, The Cabinet Years, 1950\u20131957'', ed.

On his first evening as Prime Minister he took the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Chief Whip]] [[Edward Heath]] for oysters at the [[Turf Club (Gentlemen's Club)|Turf Club]]. He silenced the [[Vehicle_horn#Klaxon|klaxon]] on the Prime Ministerial car, which Eden had used frequently, and advertised his love of reading [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Jane Austen]].

This contrasted with the Treasury ministers who argued that support of sterling required spending cuts and, probably, a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958 the three Treasury ministers\u2014[[Peter Thorneycroft, Baron Thorneycroft|Peter Thorneycroft]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Nigel Birch]], [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]], and [[Enoch Powell]], the [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] and seen as their intellectual ringleader\u2014resigned. D. R. Thorpe argues that this, coming after the resignations of Labour ministers [[Aneurin Bevan]], [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] and [[Harold Wilson]] in April 1951 (who had wanted ''higher'' expenditure), and the cuts made by Butler and Macmillan as Chancellors in 1955\u201356, was another step in the development of \"Stop-Go economics\", as opposed to prudent medium-term management.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, pp401-7\">Thorpe 2010, pp. 401\u201307</ref> Macmillan, away on a tour of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], brushed aside this incident as \"a little local difficulty\".

A succession of prime ministers since the [[Second World War]] had been determined to persuade the United States to revive [[Special Relationship (US-UK)#Nuclear weapons development|wartime co-operation]] in the area of nuclear weapons research.

This contributed to the [[Windscale fire]] on the night of 10 October 1957, which broke out in the plutonium plant of Pile No. 1, and nuclear contaminants travelled up a chimney where the filters blocked some, but not all, of the contaminated material.

Kennedy]], whose sister [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen Cavendish]] had married [[William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington]], the nephew of Macmillan's wife. He was supportive throughout the [[Cuban missile crisis]] of 1962 and Kennedy consulted him by telephone every day. The [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador]] [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] was a close family friend of the President and actively involved in [[White House]] discussions on how to resolve the crisis.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} After Kennedy was assassinated, he wrote to Kennedy's wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] a letter of condolence.<ref>''[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/02/29/did-jfk-assassination-leave-jackie-kennedy-onassis-with-ptsd.html Did JFK assassination leave Jackie Kenneyd Onassis with PTSD?]''</ref>\n\n===Wind of Change===\n[[File:British Decolonisation in Africa.png|thumb|300px|right|British decolonisation in Africa.]]\nMacmillan's first government had seen the first phase of the [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n independence movement, which accelerated under his second government. He embarked on his \"Wind of Change\" tour of Africa, starting in [[Ghana]] on 6 January 1960. He made the famous [[Wind of Change (speech)|'wind of change' speech]] in [[Cape Town]] on 3 February 1960.<ref name=saho>{{cite web|title=Harold Macmillan begins his \"winds of change\" tour of Africa|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/harold-macmillan-begins-his-winds-change-tour-africa|website=South Africa History Online|publisher=South Africa History Online|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208113303/http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/harold-macmillan-begins-his-winds-change-tour-africa|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is considered a landmark in the process of [[decolonisation]].\n\nMacmillan felt that if the costs of holding onto a particular territory outweighed the benefits then it should be dispensed with. After securing a third term for the Conservatives in 1959 he appointed [[Iain Macleod]] as Colonial Secretary. Macleod greatly accelerated decolonisation and by the time he was moved to Conservative Party chairman and Leader of the Commons in 1961 he had made the decision to give independence to [[Nigeria]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Nyasaland]] (as [[Malawi]]) and [[Northern Rhodesia]] (as [[Zambia]]).<ref>Toye, Richard ''Churchill's Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made'' (2010) p. 306</ref>\n\nNigeria, the [[Southern Cameroons]] and [[British Somaliland]] were granted independence in 1960, [[Sierra Leone]] and Tanganyika in 1961, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Uganda]] in 1962, and Kenya in 1963. [[Zanzibar]] merged with Tanganyika to form [[Tanzania]] in 1963. All remained within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] but British Somaliland, which merged with [[Italian Somaliland]] to form [[Somalia]].\n\nMacmillan's policy overrode the hostility of white minorities and the [[Conservative Monday Club]]. South Africa left the multiracial Commonwealth in 1961 and Macmillan acquiesced to the dissolution of the [[Central African Federation]] by the end of 1963.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Sabah]] ([[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British North Borneo]]), [[Sarawak]] and [[Singapore]] became independent as [[Malaysia]] in 1963.\n\nThe speedy transfer of power maintained the goodwill of the new nations but critics contended it was premature. In justification Macmillan quoted [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] in 1851:\n\n{{quote|Many politicians of our time are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition that no people ought to be free until they are fit to use their freedom. The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story, who resolved not to go into the water until he had learnt to swim. If men are to wait for liberty until they become wise and good in slavery, they may indeed wait for ever.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|page=230}}}}\n\n====Skybolt crisis====\n[[File:JFKWHP-ST-A22-1-61.tif|thumb|Macmillan and [[John F.

For the replacement for Blue Steel he opted for Britain to join the American [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt missile]] project. From the same year Macmillan permitted the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] to station [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris submarines]] at [[Holy Loch#US Navy|Holy Loch]], Scotland, as a replacement for Thor. When Skybolt was unilaterally cancelled by [[United States Secretary of Defense|US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]], Macmillan negotiated with President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] the purchase of Polaris missiles under the [[Nassau agreement]] in December 1962.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Europe====\nMacmillan worked with states outside the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) to form the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA), which from 3 May 1960 established a free-trade area. Macmillan also saw the value of rapprochement with the EEC, to which his government sought belated entry, but Britain's application was vetoed by French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 29 January 1963. De Gaulle was always strongly opposed to British entry for many reasons. He sensed the British were inevitably closely linked to the Americans. He saw the EEC as a continental arrangement primarily between France and Germany, and if Britain joined, France's role would diminish.<ref>George Wilkes, ''Britain's failure to enter the European community 1961\u201363: the enlargement negotiations and crises in European, Atlantic and Commonwealth relations'' (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5JRGARSWO9EC&pg=PA63&dq=macmillan+degaulle+nuclear+%22european+community%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cW0sT8akLovSiALO8-TECg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=macmillan%20degaulle%20nuclear%20%22european%20community%22&f=false] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526233039/https://books.google.com/books?id=5JRGARSWO9EC&pg=PA63&dq=macmillan+degaulle+nuclear+%22european+community%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cW0sT8akLovSiALO8-TECg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA |date=26 May 2016 }} p. 63 online</ref><ref>Lamb, ''Macmillan Years'', pp. 164\u201365; Chapters 14 and 15.</ref>\n\n====Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963)====\nMacmillan's previous attempt to create an agreement at the May 1960 summit in Paris had collapsed due to the [[1960 U-2 incident]]. He was a force in the negotiations leading to the signing of the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] by the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union.

However, Butler and [[Reginald Maudling]] (who was very popular with backbench MPs at that time) declined to push for his resignation, especially after a tide of support from Conservative activists around the country.\n\n====Resignation====\nBy the summer of 1963 [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Conservative Party Chairman]] [[Oliver Poole, 1st Baron Poole|Lord Poole]] was urging the ageing Macmillan to retire.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, p. 551-2\"/> The full [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning]] report into the Profumo Scandal was published on 26 September 1963.<ref>Lamb 1995, p. 488</ref>\n\nMacmillan had a meeting with Butler on 11 September and was careful to keep his options open (retire now, retire in the New Year, or fight the next election). He talked the matter over with his son Maurice and other senior ministers. Over lunch with [[Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Earl of Swinton|Lord Swinton]] on 30 September he favoured stepping down, but only if Hailsham could be shoehorned in as his successor. He saw Butler on the morning of 7 October and told him he planned to stay on to lead the Conservatives into the next General Election, then was struck down by prostate problems on the night of 7\u20138 October, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 558\u201359</ref>\n\nMacmillan was operated on at 11.30am on Thursday 10 October. Although it is sometimes stated that he believed himself to have inoperable [[prostate cancer]], he in fact knew it was benign before the operation.<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 565</ref> Macmillan was almost ready to leave hospital within ten days of the diagnosis and could easily have carried on, in the opinion of his doctor Sir John Richardson.<ref>Lamb 1995, p. 491</ref> His illness gave him a way out.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, p. 566-7\">Thorpe 2010, pp. 566\u201367</ref>\n\n====Succession====\nWhile recovering in hospital, Macmillan wrote a memorandum (dated 14 October) recommending the process by which \"soundings\" would be taken of party opinion to select his successor, which was accepted by the Cabinet on 15 October. This time backbench MPs and junior ministers were to be asked their opinion, rather than just the Cabinet as in 1957, and efforts would be made to sample opinion amongst peers and constituency activists.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, p. 566-7\"/>\n\nEnoch Powell claimed that it was wrong of Macmillan to seek to monopolise the advice given to the Queen in this way. In fact, this was done at the Palace's request, so that the Queen was not being seen to be involved in politics as had happened in January 1957, and had been decided as far back as June when it had looked as though the government might fall over the Profumo scandal. [[Ben Pimlott]] later described this as the \"biggest political misjudgement of her reign\".<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 569\u201370 the quote appears in \"The Queen\" 1996, p. 335</ref>\n\nMacmillan was succeeded by Foreign Secretary [[Alec Douglas-Home]] in a controversial move; it was alleged that Macmillan had pulled strings and utilised the party's grandees, nicknamed 'The Magic Circle', who had slanted their \"soundings\" of opinion among MPs and Cabinet Ministers to ensure that Butler was (once again) not chosen.<ref>the \"soundings\" and the accompanying political intrigues are discussed in detail in [[Rab Butler]]'s biography</ref>\n\nHe finally resigned, receiving the Queen from his hospital bed, on 18 October 1963, after nearly seven years as prime minister. He felt privately that he was being hounded from office by a backbench minority:\n\n{{quote|Some few will be content with the success they have had in the assassination of their leader and will not care very much who the successor is. ...

P. Snow]] wrote to Macmillan that his reputation would endure as, like Churchill, he was \"psychologically interesting\".<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 619</ref>\n\nAn early biographer George Hutchinson called him \"The Last Edwardian at Number Ten\" (1980), mistakenly in the view of Nigel Fisher.<ref name=\"Fisher 1982, p.369\">Fisher 1982, p. 369</ref> Fisher described him as \"complex, almost chameleon\".<ref>Fisher 1982, p. 364</ref> At times he portrayed himself as the descendant of a Scottish crofter, as a businessman, aristocrat, intellectual and soldier. Labour leader Harold Wilson wrote that his \"role as a poseur was itself a pose\".<ref>Fisher 1982, p. 365</ref> Wilson also argued that behind the public nonchalance lay a real professional.<ref name=\"Fisher 1982, p.369\"/> Fisher also wrote that he \"had a talent for pursuing progressive policies but presenting them tactfully in a Conservative tone of voice\".<ref>Fisher 1982, p. 367</ref>\n\nHistorian John Vincent explores the image Macmillan crafted of himself for his colleagues and constituents:\n\n{{quote|He presented himself as a patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as a venerable elder statesman at home with modern youth. There was something in all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether he was ever a mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.<ref>John Vincent, \"Macmillan, Harold\" in Fred M. Leventhal, ed., ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995) p. 488.</ref>}}\n\nAlistair Horne, his official biographer, concedes that after his re-election in 1959 Macmillan's premiership suffered a series of major setbacks.<ref>Horne 1989, p. 214</ref>\n\nCampbell writes that: \"a late developer who languished on the back benches ... in the 1930s, Macmillan seized his opportunity when it came with flair and ruthlessness, and [until about 1962] filled the highest office with compelling style\". However, he argues that Macmillan is remembered as having been \"a rather seedy conjuror\", famous for Premium Bonds, Beeching's cuts to the railways and the Profumo Scandal. He is also remembered for \"stop-go\" economics: first expansion despite the opposition of Thorneycroft and his team, then Selwyn Lloyd's Pay Pause, and then finally the Maudling boom, with Britain's relative economic decline, especially compared to the EEC, becoming clear despite perceptions of consumer \"affluence\" in the late 1950s. In the 1980s the aged Macmillan was seen as \"a revered but slightly pathetic figure\".<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 292</ref>\n\n[[Dominic Sandbrook]] writes that Macmillan's final weeks were typical of his premiership, \"devious, theatrical and self-seeking\" although not without droll wit and intelligence. Macmillan is best remembered for the \"affluent society\", which he inherited rather than created in the late 1950s, but chancellors came and went and by the early 1960s economic policy was \"nothing short of a shambles\", while his achievements in foreign policy made little difference to the lives of the public. By the time he left office, largely unlamented at the time, he was associated not with prosperity but with \"anachronism and decay\".<ref name=\"Sandford 2005, pp. 711-2\">Sandford 2005, pp. 711\u201312</ref>\n\nD. R. Thorpe writes that by the early 1960s Macmillan was seen as \"the epitome of all that was wrong with anachronistic Britain. This was an unfair charge.\" \"The essence of his persona was as elusive as mercury.\" He was not a member of \"[[the Establishment]]\"\u2014in fact he was a businessman who had ''married into'' the aristocracy and a rebel Chancellor of Oxford. \"He had style in abundance, (and) was a star on the world stage\". Thorpe argues that despite his 1960 \"Winds of Change\" speech, he was largely pushed into rapid independence for African countries by Maudling and Macleod.<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 614\u201317</ref>\n\nRichard Lamb argues that Macmillan was \"by far the best of Britain's postwar Prime Ministers, and his administration performed better than any of their successors\". Lamb argues that it is unfair to blame Macmillan for excessively quick African independence (resulting in many former colonies becoming dictatorships), or for the Beeching Plan (which was accepted by Labour in 1964, although Macmillan himself had reservations and had asked civil servants to draw up plans for extra road-building), and argues that had he remained in power Macmillan would never have allowed inflation to get as far out of hand as it did in the 1970s.<ref>Lamb 1995, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nJohn Turner (1994) praised Macmillan's conduct of foreign affairs.<ref name=\"Sandford 2005, pp. 711-2\"/>\n\n==Retirement, 1963\u201386==\nMacmillan initially refused a peerage and retired from politics in September 1964, a month before the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], which the Conservatives narrowly lost to Labour, now led by [[Harold Wilson]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge64.shtml| title=News: 15 October 1964| work=BBC News| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223064907/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge64.shtml| archivedate=23 February 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Oxford chancellor (1960\u201386)===\nMacmillan had been elected [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford]] in 1960, in a campaign masterminded by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], and held this office for the rest of his life, frequently presiding over college events, making speeches and tirelessly raising funds.

He became President of the [[Carlton Club]] in 1977 and would often stay at the club when he had to stay in London overnight.

He was also a member of [[Buck's Club|Buck's]], [[Pratt's]], the [[Turf Club (gentlemen's club)|Turf Club]] and [[Beefsteak Club]].

Responding to a remark made by Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] about not having boots in which to go to school, Macmillan retorted: 'If Mr Wilson did not have boots to go to school that is because he was too big for them.'<ref>'The Wit and Wisdom Inside No 10', ''Daily Express'' (27 March 2008), p. 13.</ref>\n\nMacmillan accepted the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] in 1976.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=46872 |date=9 September 1976 |page=5299 }}</ref> In October of that year he called for 'a Government of National Unity' including all parties, which could command the public support to resolve the economic crisis.

As early as 1948 [[Humphry Berkeley]] wrote of how \"he makes a show of being feeble and decrepit\", mentioning how he had suddenly stopped shambling and sprinted for a train. Nigel Fisher tells an anecdote of how Macmillan initially greeted him to his house leaning on a stick, but later walked and climbed steps perfectly well, twice acting lame again and fetching his stick when he remembered his \"act\".

Stockton''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=small|OM|PC|FRS}} (10&nbsp;February 1894&nbsp;\u2013 29 December 1986) was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1957 to 1963. Dubbed \"[[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]]\", he was known for his [[pragmatism]], wit and unflappability.\n\nMacmillan served in the [[Grenadier Guards]] during the First World War. He was wounded three times, most severely in September 1916 during the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He spent the rest of the war in a military hospital unable to walk, and suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life. After the war Macmillan joined his family business, then entered Parliament at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]] for the northern industrial constituency of [[Stockton-on-Tees (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockton-on-Tees]]. After losing his seat in [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]], he regained it in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton-On-Tees, and against [[appeasement]]. Rising to high office during the Second World War as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Macmillan then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Churchill's successor [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]]. When Eden resigned in 1957 following the [[Suez Crisis]], Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]]. As a [[One-nation conservatism|One Nation Tory]] of the [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraelian]] tradition, haunted by memories of the [[Great Depression]], he believed in the [[Welfare state|post-war settlement]] and the necessity of a [[mixed economy]], championing a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] strategy of [[public investment]] to [[demand management|maintain demand]] and pursuing [[Tory corporatism|corporatist]] policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth. Benefiting from favourable international conditions,{{sfn|Middleton|1997|pages=422\u201323}} he presided over an [[Economic history of Britain|age of affluence]], marked by low unemployment and high\u2014if uneven\u2014growth. In his [[Bedford]] speech of July 1957 he told the nation they had 'never had it so good',{{sfn|Middleton|1997|p=422}} but warned of the dangers of inflation, summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s.<ref>Peter Hennessy, ''Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties'' (London: Allen Lane, 2006), pp. 533\u201334.</ref> The Conservatives were re-elected in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] with an increased majority. \n\nIn international affairs, Macmillan rebuilt the [[Special Relationship]] with the United States from the wreckage of the [[Suez Crisis]] (of which he had been one of the architects), and facilitated the [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonisation]] of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Reconfiguring the nation's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age, he ended [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], strengthened the [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear forces]] by acquiring [[UGM-27 Polaris#British Polaris|Polaris]], and pioneered the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]] with the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence, he sought a new role for Britain in Europe, but his unwillingness to disclose [[Nuclear weapons of the United States|United States nuclear secrets]] to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom's entry into the [[European Economic Community]].<ref>Richard Lamb, ''The Macmillan Years 1957\u20131963: The Emerging Truth'' (London: John Murray, 1995), pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Near the end of his premiership, his government was rocked by the [[John Vassall|Vassall]] and [[Profumo affair|Profumo]] scandals, which to some, especially the [[Anti-establishment|rebellious youth]] of the 1960s, seemed to symbolise the moral decay of the British establishment.<ref name=\"Leitch\">{{citation |last=Leitch |first=David |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/the-spy-who-rocked-a-world-of-privilege-1313565.html |title=The spy who rocked a world of privilege |newspaper=The Independent |date=8 December 1996 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804024128/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/the-spy-who-rocked-a-world-of-privilege-1313565.html |archivedate=4 August 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> After his resignation, Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an [[wikt:elder statesman|elder statesman]].

Macmillan took control of the magazine ''New Outlook'' and made sure it published political tracts rather than purely theoretical work.<ref name=\"Horne 1988, p. 103\"/>\n\nIn 1936, Macmillan proposed the creation of a cross-party forum of antifascists to create democratic unity but his ideas were rejected by the leadership of both the Labour and Conservative parties.<ref>Seidman, Michael. Transatlantic Antifascisms: From the Spanish Civil War to the End of World War II. Cambridge University Press, 2017, p.89</ref>\n\nMacmillan supported Chamberlain's first flight for talks with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] at Berchtesgaden, but not his subsequent flights to Bad Godesberg and Munich. After [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] he was looking for a \"1931 in reverse\", i.e. a Labour-dominated coalition in which some Conservatives would serve, the reverse of the Conservative-dominated coalition which had governed Britain since 1931.<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 117\u201318</ref> He supported the independent candidate, [[Sandie Lindsay, 1st Baron Lindsay of Birker|Lindsay]], at the [[1938 Oxford by-election|Oxford by-election]]. He wrote a pamphlet \"The Price of Peace\" calling for alliance between Britain, France and the USSR, but expecting Poland to make territorial \"accommodation\" to Germany (i.e. give up the [[Danzig corridor]]). In \"Economic Aspects of Defence\", early in 1939, he called for a Ministry of Supply.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 119</ref>\n\n===Phoney War (1939\u201340)===\nMacmillan visited Finland in February 1940, then the subject of great sympathy in Britain as it was being attacked by the USSR, then [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|loosely allied]] to Nazi Germany. His last speech from the backbenches was to attack the government for not doing enough to help Finland. Britain was saved from a potentially embarrassing commitment when the [[Winter War]] ended in March 1940 (Finland would later [[Military history of Finland during World War II|fight on the German side]] against the USSR).<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 134\u201335</ref>\n\nMacmillan voted against the Government in the [[Norway Debate]], helping to bring down [[Neville Chamberlain]] as Prime Minister, and tried to join in with [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Colonel Josiah Wedgwood]] singing \"[[Rule, Britannia!]]\" in the House of Commons Chamber.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 139</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply (1940\u201342)===\nMacmillan at last attained office by serving in the wartime coalition government as the [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Ministry of Supply]] from 1940. Channon commented (29 May 1940) that there was \"some amusement over Harold Macmillan's so obvious enjoyment of his new position\".<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 252</ref>\n\nMacmillan's job was to provide armaments and other equipment to the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]]. He travelled up and down the country to co-ordinate production, working with some success under [[Lord Beaverbrook]] to increase the supply and quality of [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]].{{sfn|Fisher|1982|pages=78\u201379}}\n\n===Colonial Under-Secretary (1942)===\n[[File:Harold Macmillan in 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|Macmillan in 1942]]\nMacmillan was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in 1942, in his own words \"leaving a madhouse to enter a mausoleum\".<ref>Harold Macmillan, ''The Blast of War, 1939\u201345'' (London: Macmillan, 1967), p. 161.</ref> Though a junior minister he was a member of the [[Privy Council]], and he spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretaries]] [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]]. Macmillan was given responsibility for increasing colonial production and trade, and signalled the future policy direction when in June 1942 he declared:\n\n{{quote|The governing principle of the [[British Empire|Colonial Empire]] should be the principle of partnership between the various elements composing it. Out of partnership comes understanding and friendship. Within the fabric of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] lies the future of the Colonial territories.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|page=82}}}}\n\nMacmillan predicted that the Conservatives faced landslide defeat after the war, causing Channon to write (6 Sep 1944) of \"the foolish prophecy of that nice ass Harold Macmillan\". In October 1942 Harold Nicolson recorded Macmillan as predicting \"extreme socialism\" after the war.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 254</ref> Macmillan nearly resigned when [[Oliver Stanley]] was appointed Secretary of State in November 1942, as he would no longer be the spokesman in the Commons as he had been under Cranborne.

He reported directly to the Prime Minister instead of to the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[Anthony Eden]]. [[Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos|Oliver Lyttelton]] had a similar job at Cairo, while [[Robert Daniel Murphy|Robert Murphy]] was Macmillan's US counterpart.<ref name=\"Horne 1988, p. 151-60\"/> Macmillan built a rapport with US General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], then Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean (SACMED), which proved helpful in his career,{{sfn|Horne|2008|page=158}} and [[Richard Crossman]] later recalled that Macmillan's \"Greeks in the Roman Empire\" metaphor dated from this time (i.e. that as the US replaced Britain as the world's leading power, British politicians and diplomats should aim to guide her in the same way that Greek slaves and freedmen had advised powerful Romans).<ref>Horne 1988, p. 160</ref> At the [[Casablanca Conference]] Macmillan helped to secure US acceptance, if not recognition, of the [[Free French]] leader [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref>Horne 1988, p. 170</ref>\n\nMacmillan was badly burned in a plane crash, trying to climb back into the plane to rescue a Frenchman. He had to have a plaster cast put on his face. In his delirium he imagined himself back in a Somme casualty clearing station and asked for a message to be passed to his mother, now dead.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 174</ref>\n\nTogether with [[Gladwyn Jebb]] he helped to negotiate the Italian armistice in August 1943, between the [[Operation Husky|fall of Sicily]] and the [[Operation Avalanche|Salerno Landings]]. This caused friction with Eden and the Foreign Office.<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 195\u201399</ref> He was based at [[Caserta]] for the rest of the war. He was appointed UK High Commissioner for the Advisory Council for Italy late in 1943.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 201</ref> He visited London in October 1943 and again clashed with Eden. Eden appointed [[Duff Cooper]] as Ambassador to France (still under German occupation) and [[Noel Charles]] as Ambassador to Italy to reduce Macmillan's influence.<ref>Horne 1988, p. 210</ref> In May 1944 Macmillan infuriated Eden by demanding an early peace treaty with Italy (at that time a pro-Allied regime under [[Pietro Badoglio|Badoglio]] held some power in the southern, liberated, part of Italy), a move which Churchill favoured. In June 1944 he argued for a British-led thrust up the [[Ljubljana Gap]] into Central Europe (Operation \"Armpit\") instead of the planned diversion of US and Free French forces to the South of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]). This proposal impressed Churchill and [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|General Alexander]], but did not meet with American approval. Eden sent out Robert Dixon to abolish the job of Resident Minister, there being then no job for Macmillan back in the UK, but he managed to prevent his job being abolished. Churchill visited Italy in August 1944. On 14 September 1944 Macmillan was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Allied Central Commission for Italy (in succession to General Macfarlane). He continued to be British Minister Resident at Allied Headquarters and British Political adviser to [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|\"Jumbo\" Wilson]], now Supreme Commander, Mediterranean. On 10 November 1944 he was appointed Acting President of the Allied Commission (the Supreme Commander being President).<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 218\u201322</ref>\n\nMacmillan visited Greece on 11 December 1944. As the Germans had withdrawn, British troops under [[Ronald Scobie|General Scobie]] had deployed to Athens, but there were concerns that the largely pro-communist Greek resistance, [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and its military wing [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]], would take power (see [[Dekemvriana]]) or come into conflict with British troops. Macmillan rode in a tank and was under sniper fire at the British Embassy. Despite the hostility of large sections of British and American opinion, who were sympathetic to the guerillas and hostile to what was seen as imperialist behaviour, he persuaded a reluctant Churchill, who visited Athens later in the month, to accept [[Damaskinos of Athens|Archbishop Damaskinos]] as Regent on behalf of the exiled [[George II of Greece|King George]]. A [[Varkiza agreement|truce]] was negotiated in January 1945, enabling a pro-British regime to remain in power, as Churchill had demanded in the [[Percentages agreement]] the previous autumn.<ref>Horne 1988, pp. 230\u201340</ref><ref>In 1947 the US would take over Britain's role as \"protector\" of Greece and Turkey, to keep the Soviets out of the Mediterranean, the so-called \"[[Truman Doctrine]]\"</ref>\n\nMacmillan was also the minister advising [[Charles Keightley|General Keightley]] of [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]], the senior [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] commander in Austria responsible for [[Operation Keelhaul]], which included the forced repatriation of up to 70,000 prisoners of war to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1945. The deportations and Macmillan's involvement later became a source of controversy because of the harsh treatment meted out to [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and anti-partisans by the receiving countries, and because in the confusion V Corps went beyond the terms agreed at [[Yalta conference|Yalta]] and [[Allied Forces Headquarters]] directives by repatriating 4000 [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II|White Russian troops]] and 11,000 civilian family members, who could not properly be regarded as Soviet citizens.{{sfn|Horne|2008|pp=251\u201386}}<ref>Sir [[Curtis Keeble]], 'Macmillan and the Soviet Union', in Richard Aldous and Sabine Lee (eds), ''Harold Macmillan: Aspects of a Political Life'' (London: Macmillan, 1999), pp. 199\u2013200.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n17/ferdinand-mount/too-obviously-cleverer |title=Too Obviously Cleverer |author=Ferdinand Mount |date=8 September 2011 |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=33 |issue=17 |accessdate=15 January 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121193333/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n17/ferdinand-mount/too-obviously-cleverer |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy-all |author-link=Ferdinand Mount }}</ref>\n\n===Air Secretary (1945)===\nMacmillan toyed with an offer to succeed [[Duff Cooper]] as MP for the safe Conservative seat of [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster St George's]].<ref name=\"Horne 1988, p. 243\"/> Criticised locally for his long absence, he suggested that Lady Dorothy stand for Stockton in 1945, as she had been nursing the seat for five years.

(London, Phoenix) p. 32</ref>\n\nAlthough Macmillan played an important role in drafting the \"[[Industrial Charter]]\" (\"Crossbencher\" in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' called it the second edition of ''The Middle Way'') he now, as MP for a safe seat, adopted a somewhat more right-wing public persona, defending private enterprise and fiercely opposing the Labour government in the House of Commons.<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 255\u201356</ref>\n\n==Political career, 1951\u201357==\n\n===Housing Minister (1951\u201354)===\nWith the Conservative victory in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]] Macmillan became [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government|Minister of Housing & Local Government]] under Churchill, who entrusted him with fulfilling the pledge to build 300,000 houses per year (up from the previous target of 200,000 a year), made in response to a speech from the floor at the 1950 Party Conference. Macmillan thought at first that Housing, which ranked 13 out of 16 in the Cabinet list, was a poisoned chalice, writing in his diary (28 October 1951) that it was \"not my cup of tea at all ... I really haven't a clue how to set about the job\".

In April 1953 Beaverbrook encouraged Macmillan to think that in a future leadership contest he might emerge in a dead heat between Eden and Butler, as the young Beaverbrook (Max Aitken as he had been at the time) had helped [[Bonar Law]] to do in 1911.<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 257\u201358</ref> In July 1953 Macmillan considered postponing his gall bladder operation in case Churchill, who had just suffered a serious stroke while Eden was also in hospital, had to step down.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 259</ref>\n\nMacmillan achieved his housing target by the end of 1953, a year ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=139}}<ref name=\"HNDM\">{{cite news |title=The Housing Total Was 318,779 |work=Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail |date=5 February 1954 |accessdate=8 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000378/19540205/004/0001| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n===Defence Minister (1954\u201355)===\n[[File:Churchillcabinet1955.png|thumb|right|300px| Churchill's Cabinet, 1955 (Macmillan sitting on the far left)]]\nMacmillan was [[Secretary of State for Defence|Minister of Defence]] from October 1954, but found his authority restricted by Churchill's personal involvement.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=143}} In the opinion of ''[[The Economist]]'': 'He gave the impression that his own undoubted capacity for imaginative running of his own show melted way when an august superior was breathing down his neck.'<ref>''[[The Economist]]'' (16 April 1955).</ref>\n\nA major theme of his tenure at Defence was the ministry's growing reliance on the nuclear deterrent, in the view of some critics, to the detriment of conventional forces.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|pages=144\u201345}} The Defence White Paper of February 1955, announcing the decision to produce the [[Teller-Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]], received bipartisan support.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=145}}\n\n\"It breaks my heart to see the lion-hearted Churchill begin to sink into a sort of [[Philippe Petain|Petain]]\", Macmillan wrote in his diary as the Prime Minister's mental and physical powers visibly decayed.

He insisted on being \"undisputed head of the home front\" and that Eden's de facto deputy [[Rab Butler]], whom he was replacing as Chancellor, not have the title \"Deputy Prime Minister\" and not be treated as senior to him. He even tried (in vain) to demand that Salisbury, not Butler, should preside over the Cabinet in Eden's absence. Macmillan later claimed in his memoirs that he had still expected Butler, his junior by eight years, to succeed Eden, but correspondence with [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]] at the time makes clear that Macmillan was very much thinking of the succession. As early as January 1956 he told Eden's press secretary William Clark that it would be \"interesting to see how long Anthony can stay in the saddle\".<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 261\u201362, 264</ref>\n\nMacmillan planned to reverse the 6d cut in income tax which Butler had made a year previously, but backed off after a \"frank talk\" with Butler, who threatened resignation, on 28 March 1956.

The Egyptian government, which came to be dominated by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], was opposed to the British military presence in the [[Arab World]]. The Egyptian nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal]] by Nasser on 26 July 1956 prompted the British government and the French government of [[Guy Mollet]] to commence plans for invading Egypt, regaining the canal, and toppling Nasser. Macmillan wrote in his diary: \"If Nasser 'gets away with it', we are done for. The whole Arab world will despise us ... [[Nuri al-Said|Nuri]] [es-Said, British-backed Prime Minister of Iraq] and our friends will fall. It may well be the end of British influence and strength forever. So, in the last resort, we must use force and defy opinion, here and overseas\".<ref>Bertjan Verbeek, ''Decision-making in Great Britain during the Suez crisis'' (2003) p. 95</ref>\n\nMacmillan threatened to resign if force was not used against Nasser.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 265</ref> He was heavily involved in the secret planning of the invasion with France and Israel. It was he who first suggested collusion with Israel.{{sfn|Beckett|2006|p=74}} On 5 August 1956 Macmillan met Churchill at Chartwell, and told him that the government's plan for simply regaining control of the canal was not enough and suggested involving Israel, recording in his diary for that day: \"Surely, if we landed we must seek out the Egyptian forces; destroy them; and bring down Nasser's government. Churchill seemed to agree with all this.\"<ref>Toye, Richard ''Churchill's Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made'' (2010) p. 304</ref> Macmillan knew President Eisenhower well, but misjudged his strong opposition to a military solution. Macmillan met Eisenhower privately on 25 September 1956 and convinced himself that the US would not oppose the invasion,{{sfn|Beckett|2006|pp=73\u201374}} despite the misgivings of the British Ambassador, Sir Roger Makins, who was also present. Macmillan failed to heed a warning from Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] that whatever the British government did should wait until after the US presidential election on 6 November, and failed to report Dulles' remarks to Eden.\n\nThe treasury was his portfolio, but he did not recognise the financial disaster that could result from US government actions. Sterling was draining out of the Bank of England at an alarming rate, and it was getting worse. The canal was blocked by the Egyptians, and most oil shipments were delayed as tankers had to go around Africa. The US government refused any financial help until Britain withdrew its forces from Egypt. When he did realise this, he changed his mind and called for withdrawal on US terms, while exaggerating the financial crisis.<ref name=\"Diane B. Kunz 1991 pp 130\">Diane B.

Kunz 1991 pp 130\"/>\n\nIn later life Macmillan was open about his failure to read Eisenhower's thoughts correctly and much regretted the damage done to Anglo-American relations, but always maintained that the Anglo-French military response to the nationalisation of the Canal had been for the best.<ref>Williams, ''Harold Macmillan'' (2009) p. 267</ref> D. R. Thorpe rejects the charge that Macmillan deliberately played false over Suez (i.e. encouraged Eden to attack in order to destroy him as Prime Minister), noting that Macmillan privately put the chances of success at 51\u201349.<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 356</ref>\n\n====Succession to Eden====\nBritain's humiliation at the hands of the US caused deep anger among Conservative MPs. After the ceasefire a motion on the Order Paper attacking the US for \"gravely endangering the Atlantic Alliance\" attracted the signatures of over a hundred MPs.<ref>Howard 1987, p. 239</ref>\nMacmillan tried, but failed, to see Eisenhower (who was also refusing to see Foreign Secretary [[Selwyn Lloyd]]) behind Butler's and Eden's back. Macmillan had a number of meetings with [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|US Ambassador]] [[Winthrop Aldrich]], in which he said that if he were Prime Minister the US Administration would find him much more amenable. Eisenhower encouraged Aldrich to have further meetings. Macmillan and Butler met Aldrich on 21 November. Eisenhower spoke highly of Macmillan (\"A straight, fine man, and so far as he is concerned, the outstanding one of the British he served with during the war\").<ref>Howard 1987, p. 242</ref><ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 352\u201353 Eisenhower said these words in a meeting with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[George M. Humphrey|Humphrey]] (who was pro-Butler), [[Under Secretary of State]] [[Herbert Hoover, Jr.|Hoover]] and [[White House Office of the Staff Secretary|Staff Secretary]] [[Andrew Goodpaster]]. It is unclear whether there was ''direct'' pressure from the US Administration for Macmillan to be chosen, or rather whether being the candidate best placed to rebuild bridges with the Americans was simply another reason why leading Conservatives preferred him to Butler. Published accounts do not agree about the date of the meeting. Williams (2008, p. 270) lists it as happening on 20 November, a date repeated in Michael Jago's 2015 biography of Rab Butler. Macmillan's other recent biographer D. R. Thorpe gives it as 24 ''December'', presumably an error as the footnote refers to Eisenhower's papers for November 1956, while in his biography of Anthony Eden (2003, p. 539) Thorpe gives it as 24 November.</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 22 November 1956 Butler, who had just announced British withdrawal, addressed the [[1922 committee]] (Conservative backbenchers) with Macmillan. After Butler's downbeat remarks, ten minutes or so in length, Macmillan delivered a stirring thirty-five minute speech described by [[Enoch Powell]] as \"one of the most horrible things that I remember in politics ... (Macmillan) with all the skill of the old [[Actor-manager|actor manager]] succeeded in false-footing Rab. The sheer devilry of it verged upon the disgusting.\" He expounded on his metaphor that henceforth the British must aim to be \"Greeks in the Roman Empire\", and according to [[Philip Goodhart]]'s recollection almost knocked Butler off his chair with his expansive arm gestures. Macmillan wrote \"I held the Tory Party for the weekend, it was all I intended to do\". Macmillan had further meetings with Aldrich and Winston Churchill after Eden left for Jamaica (23 November) while briefing journalists (disingenuously) that he planned to retire and go to the Lords.<ref>Howard 1987, pp. 240\u201341</ref><ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 353\u201354</ref> He was also hinting that he would not serve under Butler.<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 269</ref>\n\nButler later recorded that during his period as acting Head of Government at Number Ten, he noticed constant comings and goings of ministers to Macmillan's study in Number 11 next door\u2014and that those who attended all seemed to receive promotions when Macmillan became Prime Minister. Macmillan had opposed Eden's trip to Jamaica and told Butler (15 December, the day after Eden's return) that younger members of the Cabinet wanted Eden out.<ref>Howard 1987, p. 244</ref> Macmillan argued at Cabinet on 4 January that Suez should be regarded as a \"strategic retreat\" like [[Battle of Mons|Mons]] or [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]]. This did not meet with Eden's approval at Cabinet on 7 January.<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 358</ref>\n\nHis political standing destroyed, Eden resigned on grounds of ill health on 9 January 1957.{{sfn|Beckett|2006|pp=77\u201378}} At that time the Conservative Party had no formal mechanism for selecting a new leader, and [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] appointed Macmillan Prime Minister after taking advice from [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|the Marquess of Salisbury]], who had asked the Cabinet individually for their opinions, all but two or three opting for Macmillan. This surprised some observers who had expected that Eden's deputy [[Rab Butler]] would be chosen.<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 361\u201362</ref> The political situation after Suez was so desperate that on taking office on 10 January he told the Queen he could not guarantee his government would last \"six weeks\"\u2014though ultimately he would be in charge of the government for more than six years.<ref>Harold Macmillan, ''The Macmillan Diaries, The Cabinet Years, 1950\u20131957'', ed.

On his first evening as Prime Minister he took the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Chief Whip]] [[Edward Heath]] for oysters at the [[Turf Club (Gentlemen's Club)|Turf Club]]. He silenced the [[Vehicle_horn#Klaxon|klaxon]] on the Prime Ministerial car, which Eden had used frequently, and advertised his love of reading [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[Jane Austen]]. On the door of the Private Secretaries' room at Number Ten he hung a quote from ''[[The Gondoliers]]'': \"Quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot\".<ref>Horne 1989, pp. 5, 13</ref>\n\nMacmillan filled government posts with 35 Old Etonians, seven of them in Cabinet.<ref>David Butler, ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000'', Macmillan, 8th edition, 2000.</ref> He was also devoted to family members: when [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire]] was later appointed (Minister for Colonial Affairs from 1963 to 1964 among other positions) he described his uncle's behaviour as \"the greatest act of nepotism ever\".<ref>Gyles Brandreth. ''Brief encounters: meetings with remarkable people'' (2001) p. 214</ref>\n\nHe was nicknamed \"[[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]]\" in 1958 by the cartoonist \"Vicky\" ([[Victor Weisz]]). It was intended as mockery but backfired, coming to be used in a neutral or friendly fashion. Vicky tried to label him with other names, including \"Mac the Knife\" at the time of widespread [[Night of the Long Knives (1962)|cabinet changes in 1962]], but none caught on.<ref>Colin Seymour-\u00dcre, ''Prime ministers and the media: issues of power and control'' (2003) p. 261</ref>\n\n====Economy====\nBesides Foreign Affairs, the economy was Macmillan's other prime concern.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (1997) pp. 223\u2013303.</ref> His [[One Nation Conservatism|One Nation]] approach to the economy was to seek high or full employment, especially with a General Election looming. This contrasted with the Treasury ministers who argued that support of sterling required spending cuts and, probably, a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958 the three Treasury ministers\u2014[[Peter Thorneycroft, Baron Thorneycroft|Peter Thorneycroft]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Nigel Birch]], [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]], and [[Enoch Powell]], the [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] and seen as their intellectual ringleader\u2014resigned. D. R. Thorpe argues that this, coming after the resignations of Labour ministers [[Aneurin Bevan]], [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] and [[Harold Wilson]] in April 1951 (who had wanted ''higher'' expenditure), and the cuts made by Butler and Macmillan as Chancellors in 1955\u201356, was another step in the development of \"Stop-Go economics\", as opposed to prudent medium-term management.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, pp401-7\">Thorpe 2010, pp. 401\u201307</ref> Macmillan, away on a tour of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], brushed aside this incident as \"a little local difficulty\".

He worked to narrow the post-[[Suez Crisis|Suez Crisis (1956)]] rift with the United States, where his wartime friendship with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] was key; the two had a productive conference in [[Bermuda]] as early as March 1957.\n\nIn February 1959, Macmillan visited the [[Soviet Union]]. Talks with [[Nikita Khrushchev]] eased tensions in East-West relations over [[West Berlin]] and led to an agreement in principle to stop nuclear tests and to hold a further summit meeting of [[NATO|Allied]] and Soviet heads of government.{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=214}}\n\nIn the Middle East, faced by the 1958 collapse of the [[Baghdad Pact]] and the spread of Soviet influence, Macmillan acted decisively to restore the confidence of [[Persian Gulf]] allies, using the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Special Air Service|special forces]] to defeat a revolt backed by [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Egypt]] against the Sultan of Oman, [[Said bin Taimur]], in July 1957;{{sfn|Fisher|1982|p=193}} deploying airborne battalions to defend [[Jordan]] against Syrian subversion in July 1958;<ref>Horne, ''Macmillan'', Volume II, pp. 94\u201395.</ref> and deterring a threatened Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] by landing a brigade group in July 1960.<ref>Horne, ''Macmillan'', Volume II, p. 419.</ref>\n\nMacmillan was a major proponent and architect of [[decolonisation]].

A succession of prime ministers since the [[Second World War]] had been determined to persuade the United States to revive [[Special Relationship (US-UK)#Nuclear weapons development|wartime co-operation]] in the area of nuclear weapons research. Macmillan believed that one way to encourage such co-operation would be for the United Kingdom to speed up the development of its own [[Teller\u2013Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]], which was [[Grapple X|successfully tested]] on 8 November 1957.\n\nMacmillan's decision led to increased demands on the [[Windscale#The Windscale Piles|Windscale]] and (subsequently) [[Calder Hall nuclear power station|Calder Hall]] nuclear plants to produce [[Plutonium#Explosives|plutonium]] for military purposes.<ref>Nick Rufford, 'A-bomb links kept secret from Queen', ''Sunday Times'' (3 January 1988).</ref> As a result, safety margins for radioactive materials inside the Windscale reactor were eroded. This contributed to the [[Windscale fire]] on the night of 10 October 1957, which broke out in the plutonium plant of Pile No. 1, and nuclear contaminants travelled up a chimney where the filters blocked some, but not all, of the contaminated material. The radioactive cloud spread to south-east England and fallout reached mainland Europe. Although scientists had warned of the dangers of such an accident for some time, the government blamed the workers who had put out the fire for 'an error of judgement', rather than the political pressure for fast-tracking the megaton bomb.<ref>'Windscale: Britain's Biggest Nuclear Disaster', broadcast on Monday, 8 October 2007, at 2100 BST on BBC Two.</ref><ref>Paddy Shennan, 'Britain's Biggest Nuclear Disaster', ''Liverpool Echo'' (13 October 2007), p. 26.</ref>\n\nConcerned that public confidence in the nuclear programme might be shaken and that technical information might be misused by opponents of defence co-operation in the [[United States Congress|US Congress]], Macmillan withheld all but the summary of a report into the fire prepared for the [[Atomic Energy Authority]] by [[William Penney, Baron Penney|Sir William Penney]], director of the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]].<ref>John Hunt.

The [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador]] [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|David Ormsby-Gore]] was a close family friend of the President and actively involved in [[White House]] discussions on how to resolve the crisis.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} After Kennedy was assassinated, he wrote to Kennedy's wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] a letter of condolence.<ref>''[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/02/29/did-jfk-assassination-leave-jackie-kennedy-onassis-with-ptsd.html Did JFK assassination leave Jackie Kenneyd Onassis with PTSD?]''</ref>\n\n===Wind of Change===\n[[File:British Decolonisation in Africa.png|thumb|300px|right|British decolonisation in Africa.]]\nMacmillan's first government had seen the first phase of the [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n independence movement, which accelerated under his second government. He embarked on his \"Wind of Change\" tour of Africa, starting in [[Ghana]] on 6 January 1960.

After securing a third term for the Conservatives in 1959 he appointed [[Iain Macleod]] as Colonial Secretary. Macleod greatly accelerated decolonisation and by the time he was moved to Conservative Party chairman and Leader of the Commons in 1961 he had made the decision to give independence to [[Nigeria]], [[Tanganyika]], [[Kenya]], [[Nyasaland]] (as [[Malawi]]) and [[Northern Rhodesia]] (as [[Zambia]]).<ref>Toye, Richard ''Churchill's Empire: The World That Made Him and the World He Made'' (2010) p. 306</ref>\n\nNigeria, the [[Southern Cameroons]] and [[British Somaliland]] were granted independence in 1960, [[Sierra Leone]] and Tanganyika in 1961, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Uganda]] in 1962, and Kenya in 1963. [[Zanzibar]] merged with Tanganyika to form [[Tanzania]] in 1963. All remained within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] but British Somaliland, which merged with [[Italian Somaliland]] to form [[Somalia]].\n\nMacmillan's policy overrode the hostility of white minorities and the [[Conservative Monday Club]]. South Africa left the multiracial Commonwealth in 1961 and Macmillan acquiesced to the dissolution of the [[Central African Federation]] by the end of 1963.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Sabah]] ([[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British North Borneo]]), [[Sarawak]] and [[Singapore]] became independent as [[Malaysia]] in 1963.\n\nThe speedy transfer of power maintained the goodwill of the new nations but critics contended it was premature. In justification Macmillan quoted [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]] in 1851:\n\n{{quote|Many politicians of our time are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition that no people ought to be free until they are fit to use their freedom.

For the replacement for Blue Steel he opted for Britain to join the American [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt missile]] project. From the same year Macmillan permitted the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] to station [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris submarines]] at [[Holy Loch#US Navy|Holy Loch]], Scotland, as a replacement for Thor.

Macmillan also saw the value of rapprochement with the EEC, to which his government sought belated entry, but Britain's application was vetoed by French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 29 January 1963. De Gaulle was always strongly opposed to British entry for many reasons. He sensed the British were inevitably closely linked to the Americans. He saw the EEC as a continental arrangement primarily between France and Germany, and if Britain joined, France's role would diminish.<ref>George Wilkes, ''Britain's failure to enter the European community 1961\u201363: the enlargement negotiations and crises in European, Atlantic and Commonwealth relations'' (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5JRGARSWO9EC&pg=PA63&dq=macmillan+degaulle+nuclear+%22european+community%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cW0sT8akLovSiALO8-TECg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=macmillan%20degaulle%20nuclear%20%22european%20community%22&f=false] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526233039/https://books.google.com/books?id=5JRGARSWO9EC&pg=PA63&dq=macmillan+degaulle+nuclear+%22european+community%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cW0sT8akLovSiALO8-TECg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA |date=26 May 2016 }} p. 63 online</ref><ref>Lamb, ''Macmillan Years'', pp. 164\u201365; Chapters 14 and 15.</ref>\n\n====Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963)====\nMacmillan's previous attempt to create an agreement at the May 1960 summit in Paris had collapsed due to the [[1960 U-2 incident]]. He was a force in the negotiations leading to the signing of the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] by the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union.

However, Butler and [[Reginald Maudling]] (who was very popular with backbench MPs at that time) declined to push for his resignation, especially after a tide of support from Conservative activists around the country.\n\n====Resignation====\nBy the summer of 1963 [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|Conservative Party Chairman]] [[Oliver Poole, 1st Baron Poole|Lord Poole]] was urging the ageing Macmillan to retire.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, p. 551-2\"/> The full [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Denning]] report into the Profumo Scandal was published on 26 September 1963.<ref>Lamb 1995, p. 488</ref>\n\nMacmillan had a meeting with Butler on 11 September and was careful to keep his options open (retire now, retire in the New Year, or fight the next election). He talked the matter over with his son Maurice and other senior ministers. Over lunch with [[Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Earl of Swinton|Lord Swinton]] on 30 September he favoured stepping down, but only if Hailsham could be shoehorned in as his successor. He saw Butler on the morning of 7 October and told him he planned to stay on to lead the Conservatives into the next General Election, then was struck down by prostate problems on the night of 7\u20138 October, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.<ref>Campbell 2009, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 558\u201359</ref>\n\nMacmillan was operated on at 11.30am on Thursday 10 October. Although it is sometimes stated that he believed himself to have inoperable [[prostate cancer]], he in fact knew it was benign before the operation.<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 565</ref> Macmillan was almost ready to leave hospital within ten days of the diagnosis and could easily have carried on, in the opinion of his doctor Sir John Richardson.<ref>Lamb 1995, p. 491</ref> His illness gave him a way out.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, p. 566-7\">Thorpe 2010, pp. 566\u201367</ref>\n\n====Succession====\nWhile recovering in hospital, Macmillan wrote a memorandum (dated 14 October) recommending the process by which \"soundings\" would be taken of party opinion to select his successor, which was accepted by the Cabinet on 15 October. This time backbench MPs and junior ministers were to be asked their opinion, rather than just the Cabinet as in 1957, and efforts would be made to sample opinion amongst peers and constituency activists.<ref name=\"Thorpe 2010, p. 566-7\"/>\n\nEnoch Powell claimed that it was wrong of Macmillan to seek to monopolise the advice given to the Queen in this way. In fact, this was done at the Palace's request, so that the Queen was not being seen to be involved in politics as had happened in January 1957, and had been decided as far back as June when it had looked as though the government might fall over the Profumo scandal. [[Ben Pimlott]] later described this as the \"biggest political misjudgement of her reign\".<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 569\u201370 the quote appears in \"The Queen\" 1996, p. 335</ref>\n\nMacmillan was succeeded by Foreign Secretary [[Alec Douglas-Home]] in a controversial move; it was alleged that Macmillan had pulled strings and utilised the party's grandees, nicknamed 'The Magic Circle', who had slanted their \"soundings\" of opinion among MPs and Cabinet Ministers to ensure that Butler was (once again) not chosen.<ref>the \"soundings\" and the accompanying political intrigues are discussed in detail in [[Rab Butler]]'s biography</ref>\n\nHe finally resigned, receiving the Queen from his hospital bed, on 18 October 1963, after nearly seven years as prime minister. He felt privately that he was being hounded from office by a backbench minority:\n\n{{quote|Some few will be content with the success they have had in the assassination of their leader and will not care very much who the successor is. ...

P. Snow]] wrote to Macmillan that his reputation would endure as, like Churchill, he was \"psychologically interesting\".<ref>Thorpe 2010, p. 619</ref>\n\nAn early biographer George Hutchinson called him \"The Last Edwardian at Number Ten\" (1980), mistakenly in the view of Nigel Fisher.<ref name=\"Fisher 1982, p.369\">Fisher 1982, p. 369</ref> Fisher described him as \"complex, almost chameleon\".<ref>Fisher 1982, p. 364</ref> At times he portrayed himself as the descendant of a Scottish crofter, as a businessman, aristocrat, intellectual and soldier. Labour leader Harold Wilson wrote that his \"role as a poseur was itself a pose\".<ref>Fisher 1982, p. 365</ref> Wilson also argued that behind the public nonchalance lay a real professional.<ref name=\"Fisher 1982, p.369\"/> Fisher also wrote that he \"had a talent for pursuing progressive policies but presenting them tactfully in a Conservative tone of voice\".<ref>Fisher 1982, p. 367</ref>\n\nHistorian John Vincent explores the image Macmillan crafted of himself for his colleagues and constituents:\n\n{{quote|He presented himself as a patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as a venerable elder statesman at home with modern youth. There was something in all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether he was ever a mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.<ref>John Vincent, \"Macmillan, Harold\" in Fred M. Leventhal, ed., ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995) p. 488.</ref>}}\n\nAlistair Horne, his official biographer, concedes that after his re-election in 1959 Macmillan's premiership suffered a series of major setbacks.<ref>Horne 1989, p. 214</ref>\n\nCampbell writes that: \"a late developer who languished on the back benches ... in the 1930s, Macmillan seized his opportunity when it came with flair and ruthlessness, and [until about 1962] filled the highest office with compelling style\". However, he argues that Macmillan is remembered as having been \"a rather seedy conjuror\", famous for Premium Bonds, Beeching's cuts to the railways and the Profumo Scandal. He is also remembered for \"stop-go\" economics: first expansion despite the opposition of Thorneycroft and his team, then Selwyn Lloyd's Pay Pause, and then finally the Maudling boom, with Britain's relative economic decline, especially compared to the EEC, becoming clear despite perceptions of consumer \"affluence\" in the late 1950s. In the 1980s the aged Macmillan was seen as \"a revered but slightly pathetic figure\".<ref>Campbell 2009, p. 292</ref>\n\n[[Dominic Sandbrook]] writes that Macmillan's final weeks were typical of his premiership, \"devious, theatrical and self-seeking\" although not without droll wit and intelligence. Macmillan is best remembered for the \"affluent society\", which he inherited rather than created in the late 1950s, but chancellors came and went and by the early 1960s economic policy was \"nothing short of a shambles\", while his achievements in foreign policy made little difference to the lives of the public. By the time he left office, largely unlamented at the time, he was associated not with prosperity but with \"anachronism and decay\".<ref name=\"Sandford 2005, pp. 711-2\">Sandford 2005, pp. 711\u201312</ref>\n\nD. R. Thorpe writes that by the early 1960s Macmillan was seen as \"the epitome of all that was wrong with anachronistic Britain. This was an unfair charge.\" \"The essence of his persona was as elusive as mercury.\" He was not a member of \"[[the Establishment]]\"\u2014in fact he was a businessman who had ''married into'' the aristocracy and a rebel Chancellor of Oxford. \"He had style in abundance, (and) was a star on the world stage\". Thorpe argues that despite his 1960 \"Winds of Change\" speech, he was largely pushed into rapid independence for African countries by Maudling and Macleod.<ref>Thorpe 2010, pp. 614\u201317</ref>\n\nRichard Lamb argues that Macmillan was \"by far the best of Britain's postwar Prime Ministers, and his administration performed better than any of their successors\". Lamb argues that it is unfair to blame Macmillan for excessively quick African independence (resulting in many former colonies becoming dictatorships), or for the Beeching Plan (which was accepted by Labour in 1964, although Macmillan himself had reservations and had asked civil servants to draw up plans for extra road-building), and argues that had he remained in power Macmillan would never have allowed inflation to get as far out of hand as it did in the 1970s.<ref>Lamb 1995, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nJohn Turner (1994) praised Macmillan's conduct of foreign affairs.<ref name=\"Sandford 2005, pp. 711-2\"/>\n\n==Retirement, 1963\u201386==\nMacmillan initially refused a peerage and retired from politics in September 1964, a month before the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]], which the Conservatives narrowly lost to Labour, now led by [[Harold Wilson]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge64.shtml| title=News: 15 October 1964| work=BBC News| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223064907/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge64.shtml| archivedate=23 February 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Oxford chancellor (1960\u201386)===\nMacmillan had been elected [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford]] in 1960, in a campaign masterminded by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], and held this office for the rest of his life, frequently presiding over college events, making speeches and tirelessly raising funds.

Macmillan's grave is on the right.]]\nMacmillan had often play-acted being an old man long before real old age set in. As early as 1948 [[Humphry Berkeley]] wrote of how \"he makes a show of being feeble and decrepit\", mentioning how he had suddenly stopped shambling and sprinted for a train. Nigel Fisher tells an anecdote of how Macmillan initially greeted him to his house leaning on a stick, but later walked and climbed steps perfectly well, twice acting lame again and fetching his stick when he remembered his \"act\". However, in genuine old age he became almost blind, causing him to need sticks and a helping arm.<ref>Fisher 1982, pp. 361\u201362</ref>\n\nMacmillan died at [[Birch Grove]], the Macmillan family mansion on the edge of [[Ashdown Forest]] near Chelwood Gate in [[East Sussex]], four days after Christmas in 1986. His age was 92 years and 322 days\u2014 the greatest age attained by a British Prime Minister until surpassed by Lord Callaghan on 14 February 2005.\nHis grandson and heir [[Alexander Macmillan, 2nd Earl of Stockton|Alexander, Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden]], said: \"In the last 48 hours he was very weak but entirely reasonable and intelligent.

Harold Macmillan was, of course, not solely or even pre-eminently responsible for that.

Arsenal were the champions and Chelsea, who had spent heavily throughout the season, were the runners up. Arsenal ended the season [[The Invincibles (football)|without a single defeat]] \u2013 the first team ever to do so in a 38-game league season and the second team overall (the first was [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1889, 115 years earlier, during a 22-game league season).\n\n==Season summary==\n\nHaving qualified for the Champions' League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a \u00a3100&nbsp;million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner [[Roman Abramovich]]. Manchester United's attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], but the midfield was weakened following the \u00a325&nbsp;million pre-season sale of [[David Beckham]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after [[Rio Ferdinand]] was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the \"failure or refusal to take a drugs test\". The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand's club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/motive-is-always-considered-in-deciding-guilt-576995.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Motive is always considered in deciding guilt | first=Nick | last=Harris | date=18 December 2003 | accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> [[Manchester City F.C.|City]] themselves had just moved from [[Maine Road]] to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/club-history|title=Club History|publisher=Manchester City Football Club }}</ref>\n\nArsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] in the 2003 close season, but French striker [[Thierry Henry]] was instrumental in Arsenal's success. Away from the Premier League, [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]]'s team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions. They were knocked-out by [[2003\u201304 Football League Cup|League Cup]] eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. They lost their defence of the [[2003\u201304 FA Cup|FA Cup]] (which they held for two seasons in a row) after losing to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-final. Arsenal were knocked out of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-finals by Chelsea (3\u20132 on aggregate). These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal thumped [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] only days later. Arsenal's [[The Invincibles (football)|Invincibles]] finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats and 90 points.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. The other relegation place went to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after [[David O'Leary]] was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were finally relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football \u2013 just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals.\n\nIn his third season as Middlesbrough manager, [[Steve McClaren]] had guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy \u2013 sealed with a 2\u20131 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to League Cup success in 1996. He was also the first manager to take Middlesbrough into European competition \u2013 they would be competing in the 2004\u201305 [[UEFA Cup]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2002\u201303 Football League First Division|First Division]].

Arsenal were the champions and Chelsea, who had spent heavily throughout the season, were the runners up. Arsenal ended the season [[The Invincibles (football)|without a single defeat]] \u2013 the first team ever to do so in a 38-game league season and the second team overall (the first was [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1889, 115 years earlier, during a 22-game league season).\n\n==Season summary==\n\nHaving qualified for the Champions' League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a \u00a3100&nbsp;million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner [[Roman Abramovich]]. Manchester United's attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], but the midfield was weakened following the \u00a325&nbsp;million pre-season sale of [[David Beckham]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after [[Rio Ferdinand]] was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the \"failure or refusal to take a drugs test\". The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand's club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/motive-is-always-considered-in-deciding-guilt-576995.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Motive is always considered in deciding guilt | first=Nick | last=Harris | date=18 December 2003 | accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> [[Manchester City F.C.|City]] themselves had just moved from [[Maine Road]] to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/club-history|title=Club History|publisher=Manchester City Football Club }}</ref>\n\nArsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] in the 2003 close season, but French striker [[Thierry Henry]] was instrumental in Arsenal's success. Away from the Premier League, [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]]'s team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions. They were knocked-out by [[2003\u201304 Football League Cup|League Cup]] eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. They lost their defence of the [[2003\u201304 FA Cup|FA Cup]] (which they held for two seasons in a row) after losing to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-final. Arsenal were knocked out of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-finals by Chelsea (3\u20132 on aggregate). These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal thumped [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] only days later. Arsenal's [[The Invincibles (football)|Invincibles]] finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats and 90 points.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. The other relegation place went to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after [[David O'Leary]] was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were finally relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football \u2013 just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals.\n\nIn his third season as Middlesbrough manager, [[Steve McClaren]] had guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy \u2013 sealed with a 2\u20131 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to League Cup success in 1996. He was also the first manager to take Middlesbrough into European competition \u2013 they would be competing in the 2004\u201305 [[UEFA Cup]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2002\u201303 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], returning to the top flight after an absence of fifteen, one and nineteen years respectively. This was also both Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers' first season in the Premier League.

It is the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by population|third-most populous city in the Philippines]] after [[Quezon City]] and [[Manila]], the most populous city in the country outside [[Metro Manila]], and the most populous in Mindanao.{{PH census|2015}} As of the 2015 census the city had a population of 1,632,991.\n\nIt is geographically situated in the province of [[Davao del Sur]] and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but the city is governed and administered independently from it. The city is divided into three congressional districts, which are subdivided into 11 administrative districts with a total of 182 [[barangay]]s.\n\nDavao City is the center of [[Metro Davao]], the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Philippines|third-most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines]]. (As of the 2015 census this had a population of 2.5 million, compared with Metro Manila's 12.8 million and [[Metro Cebu]]'s 2.8 million.) The city serves as the main trade, commerce, and industry hub of Mindanao, and the regional center of [[Davao Region]]. Davao is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the Philippines. The city is also nicknamed the \"[[Durian]] Capital of the Philippines\".\n\n==Etymology==\nThe region's name is derived from its [[Bagobo]] origins. The Bagobos were indigenous to the Philippines. The word ''davao'' came from the phonetic blending of three [[Lumad peoples|Bagobo]] subgroups' names for the [[Davao River]], a major waterway emptying into the [[Davao Gulf]] near the city. The aboriginal Obos, who inhabit the hinterlands of the region, called the river ''Davah'' (with a gentle vowel ending, although later pronunciation is with a hard ''v'' or ''b''); the Clatta (or Giangan/Diangan) called it ''Dawaw'', and the Tagabawas called it ''Dabo''. To the Obos, ''davah'' also means \"a place beyond the high grounds\" (alluding to settlements at the mouth of the river surrounded by high, rolling hills).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/central-cultural-communities/bagobo/ |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2018 |first1=Sonia D. |last1=Mangune |title=Bagobo |website=ncca.gov.ph |publisher=[[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Spanish era===\nAlthough the Spaniards began to explore the Davao Gulf area as early as the 16th century, Spanish influence was negligible in the Davao region until 1844, when the Spanish Governor General of the Philippines [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa, 1st Count of Manila|Narciso Claver\u00eda]] ordered the [[Davao Gulf]] region, including what is now Davao City, to be claimed Davao City for the Spanish Crown, despite protests by the [[Maguindanao Sultanate|Sultan of Maguindanao]]. Official colonization of the area, however, began in 1848 when an expedition of 70 men and women led by Jos\u00e9 Cruz de Uyanguren of [[Bergara|Vergara]], Spain, made a landing on the estuary of the [[Davao River]] the same year, intent on colonizing the vicinity. Nearby, a settlement was situated on the banks of the river, ruled by a Muslim Bagobo chieftain named Datu Bago.\n\nBeing the strongest chieftain in the region, Datu Bago imposed heavy tribute on the [[Mandaya]] tribes nearby, therefore also making him the most loathed chieftain in the region. Cruz de Uyanguren has orders from the higher authorities in [[Manila]] to colonize the Davao Gulf region, which included the Bagobo settlement on the northern riverbank. At this juncture, a Mandaya chieftain named Datu Daupan, who then ruled [[Samal Island]], came to him, seeking for an alliance against Datu Bago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-davao/20140706/281612418502280|title=PressReader.com - Your favorite newspapers and magazines.|website=www.pressreader.com}}</ref> The two chieftains were archrivals, and Cruz de Uyanguren took advantage of it, initiating an alliance between Spain and the Mandayas of Samal Island. Intent on taking the settlement for Spain, he and his men accordingly assaulted it, but the Bagobo natives fiercely resisted the attacks, which resulted in his Samal Mandaya allies to retreat and not fight again. Thus, a three-month long inconclusive battle for the possession of the settlement ensued which was only decided when an infantry company which sailed its way via warships from [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] came in as reinforcements, thus ensuring the takeover of the settlement and its surroundings by the Spaniards while the defeated Bagobos fled further inland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philippinescities.com/davao-city-davao-del-sur/|title=Davao City History &#124; Tourist Spots and Festivals &#124; Philippines Cities}}</ref>\n\nAfter Cruz de Oyanguren defeated Bago, he founded the town of ''Nueva Vergara'', the future Davao, on 29 June 1848<ref>{{cite book |first1=Camilo T. |last1=Nunez |first2=Dante P. |last2=Diansay |year=2003 |title=Cateel Centennial Book |publisher=Local Government Unit of Cateel |pages=550}}</ref> in an area of mangrove swamps which is now Bolton Riverside, in honor of his home in Spain and becoming its first [[governor]].

The city has a total land area of {{convert|2,443.61|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by area|largest city in the Philippines in terms of land area]]. It is the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by population|third-most populous city in the Philippines]] after [[Quezon City]] and [[Manila]], the most populous city in the country outside [[Metro Manila]], and the most populous in Mindanao.{{PH census|2015}} As of the 2015 census the city had a population of 1,632,991.\n\nIt is geographically situated in the province of [[Davao del Sur]] and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but the city is governed and administered independently from it. The city is divided into three congressional districts, which are subdivided into 11 administrative districts with a total of 182 [[barangay]]s.\n\nDavao City is the center of [[Metro Davao]], the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Philippines|third-most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines]]. (As of the 2015 census this had a population of 2.5 million, compared with Metro Manila's 12.8 million and [[Metro Cebu]]'s 2.8 million.) The city serves as the main trade, commerce, and industry hub of Mindanao, and the regional center of [[Davao Region]]. Davao is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the Philippines. The city is also nicknamed the \"[[Durian]] Capital of the Philippines\".\n\n==Etymology==\nThe region's name is derived from its [[Bagobo]] origins. The Bagobos were indigenous to the Philippines. The word ''davao'' came from the phonetic blending of three [[Lumad peoples|Bagobo]] subgroups' names for the [[Davao River]], a major waterway emptying into the [[Davao Gulf]] near the city. The aboriginal Obos, who inhabit the hinterlands of the region, called the river ''Davah'' (with a gentle vowel ending, although later pronunciation is with a hard ''v'' or ''b''); the Clatta (or Giangan/Diangan) called it ''Dawaw'', and the Tagabawas called it ''Dabo''. To the Obos, ''davah'' also means \"a place beyond the high grounds\" (alluding to settlements at the mouth of the river surrounded by high, rolling hills).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/central-cultural-communities/bagobo/ |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=25 May 2018 |first1=Sonia D. |last1=Mangune |title=Bagobo |website=ncca.gov.ph |publisher=[[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Spanish era===\nAlthough the Spaniards began to explore the Davao Gulf area as early as the 16th century, Spanish influence was negligible in the Davao region until 1844, when the Spanish Governor General of the Philippines [[Narciso Claver\u00eda y Zald\u00faa, 1st Count of Manila|Narciso Claver\u00eda]] ordered the [[Davao Gulf]] region, including what is now Davao City, to be claimed Davao City for the Spanish Crown, despite protests by the [[Maguindanao Sultanate|Sultan of Maguindanao]]. Official colonization of the area, however, began in 1848 when an expedition of 70 men and women led by Jos\u00e9 Cruz de Uyanguren of [[Bergara|Vergara]], Spain, made a landing on the estuary of the [[Davao River]] the same year, intent on colonizing the vicinity. Nearby, a settlement was situated on the banks of the river, ruled by a Muslim Bagobo chieftain named Datu Bago.\n\nBeing the strongest chieftain in the region, Datu Bago imposed heavy tribute on the [[Mandaya]] tribes nearby, therefore also making him the most loathed chieftain in the region. Cruz de Uyanguren has orders from the higher authorities in [[Manila]] to colonize the Davao Gulf region, which included the Bagobo settlement on the northern riverbank. At this juncture, a Mandaya chieftain named Datu Daupan, who then ruled [[Samal Island]], came to him, seeking for an alliance against Datu Bago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-davao/20140706/281612418502280|title=PressReader.com - Your favorite newspapers and magazines.|website=www.pressreader.com}}</ref> The two chieftains were archrivals, and Cruz de Uyanguren took advantage of it, initiating an alliance between Spain and the Mandayas of Samal Island. Intent on taking the settlement for Spain, he and his men accordingly assaulted it, but the Bagobo natives fiercely resisted the attacks, which resulted in his Samal Mandaya allies to retreat and not fight again. Thus, a three-month long inconclusive battle for the possession of the settlement ensued which was only decided when an infantry company which sailed its way via warships from [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] came in as reinforcements, thus ensuring the takeover of the settlement and its surroundings by the Spaniards while the defeated Bagobos fled further inland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philippinescities.com/davao-city-davao-del-sur/|title=Davao City History &#124; Tourist Spots and Festivals &#124; Philippines Cities}}</ref>\n\nAfter Cruz de Oyanguren defeated Bago, he founded the town of ''Nueva Vergara'', the future Davao, on 29 June 1848<ref>{{cite book |first1=Camilo T. |last1=Nunez |first2=Dante P. |last2=Diansay |year=2003 |title=Cateel Centennial Book |publisher=Local Government Unit of Cateel |pages=550}}</ref> in an area of mangrove swamps which is now Bolton Riverside, in honor of his home in Spain and becoming its first [[governor]].

The areological mechanism of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] occurs more often than that of the [[trade wind]]s and because it experiences rare cyclones the climate is not purely equatorial but subequatorial. Average monthly temperatures are always above {{convert|26|C|1}}, and average monthly rainfall is above {{convert|77|mm|in|2}}. This gives the city a tropical climate, without a true [[dry season]]; while there is significant rainfall in winter, the largest rainfall occurs during the summer months (see climate chart, below).\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n| location     = Davao City (1981\u20132010, extremes 1903\u20132012)\n| metric first = yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 35.0\n| Feb record high C = 36.7\n| Mar record high C = 36.7\n| Apr record high C = 37.0\n| May record high C = 37.3\n| Jun record high C = 35.2\n| Jul record high C = 35.6\n| Aug record high C = 36.0\n| Sep record high C = 35.1\n| Oct record high C = 35.6\n| Nov record high C = 36.2\n| Dec record high C = 35.0\n|year record high C = 37.3\n| Jan high C = 30.8\n| Feb high C = 31.2\n| Mar high C = 32.2\n| Apr high C = 33.0\n| May high C = 32.6\n| Jun high C = 31.8\n| Jul high C = 31.5\n| Aug high C = 31.7\n| Sep high C = 31.9\n| Oct high C = 32.3\n| Nov high C = 32.1\n| Dec high C = 31.4\n| year high C = 31.9\n| Jan mean C = 27.1\n| Feb mean C = 27.3\n| Mar mean C = 27.9\n| Apr mean C = 28.6\n| May mean C = 28.6\n| Jun mean C = 28.0\n| Jul mean C = 27.7\n| Aug mean C = 27.9\n| Sep mean C = 27.9\n| Oct mean C = 28.1\n| Nov mean C = 28.0\n| Dec mean C = 27.5\n| year mean C = 27.9\n| Jan low C = 23.3\n| Feb low C = 23.3\n| Mar low C = 23.6\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 24.6\n| Jun low C = 24.2\n| Jul low C = 23.9\n| Aug low C = 24.0\n| Sep low C = 23.9\n| Oct low C = 23.9\n| Nov low C = 23.9\n| Dec low C = 23.7\n| year low C = 23.9\n| Jan record low C = 17.0\n| Feb record low C = 16.1\n| Mar record low C = 17.4\n| Apr record low C = 19.1\n| May record low C = 20.2\n| Jun record low C = 20.3\n| Jul record low C = 20.0\n| Aug record low C = 18.5\n| Sep record low C = 20.0\n| Oct record low C = 19.2\n| Nov record low C = 19.1\n| Dec record low C = 16.2\n|year record low C = 16.1\n| Jan rain mm = 140.3\n| Feb rain mm = 109.4\n| Mar rain mm = 108.4\n| Apr rain mm = 124.7\n| May rain mm = 158.7\n| Jun rain mm = 186.7\n| Jul rain mm = 165.0\n| Aug rain mm = 170.0\n| Sep rain mm = 170.4\n| Oct rain mm = 174.8\n| Nov rain mm = 138.1\n| Dec rain mm = 112.6\n|year rain mm = 1759.1\n| rain colour = green\n| unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan rain days = 14\n| Feb rain days = 12\n| Mar rain days = 11\n| Apr rain days = 11\n| May rain days = 16\n| Jun rain days = 18\n| Jul rain days = 16\n| Aug rain days = 15\n| Sep rain days = 15\n| Oct rain days = 16\n| Nov rain days = 16\n| Dec rain days = 14\n|year rain days = 174\n| Jan humidity = 82\n| Feb humidity = 81\n| Mar humidity = 78\n| Apr humidity = 77\n| May humidity = 80\n| Jun humidity = 82\n| Jul humidity = 83\n| Aug humidity = 82\n| Sep humidity = 82\n| Oct humidity = 81\n| Nov humidity = 82\n| Dec humidity = 81\n| year humidity = 81\n| source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181002033257/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvaldavdelsur1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = 2 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/d9212dc8-8164-44ae-8170-cf3a306c7d82\n| title = Davao City, Davao del Sur Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 1 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20181002033407/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrdavcitydavdelsur.csv\n| archivedate = 2 October 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/f35bb79e-e78b-4316-94c5-73ac6b09cbe5\n| title = Davao City, Davao del Sur Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = 1 October 2018}}</ref>\n| date     = January 2013}}\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nMount Apo is home to many bird species, 111 of which are [[Endemism|endemic]] to the area.
