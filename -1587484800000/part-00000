The 21-story WAC clubhouse opened in December 1930 and was designed in the [[Art Deco]] style by Seattle architect Sherwood D. Ford.\n\nThe five-story WAC includes a 25-yard pool, full-size basketball court, running track, handball and racquetball courts, and pilates and yoga studios. The top ten floors house the Inn at the WAC, a 109-room boutique hotel. The club also offers a full-service day spa and a wellness center with nutrition, physical therapy, and naturopathic services. The building is also home to three restaurants, a private ballroom, social areas, and numerous meeting spaces.\n\nThe idea of the [[Century 21 Exposition]] was first conceived by club members within the building in January 1955.<ref name=\"Emporis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=seattletower-seattle-wa-usa|title=Emporis.com page}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Washington Athletic Club became a City of Seattle Landmark,<ref>[https://www.cityofseattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/w.htm Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for W], Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle.

Clarke put together a committee of Seattle attorneys, [[capitalist]]s and bankers to raise money to form a new athletic club to serve the city's skyrocketing population.<ref name=25th/> They began soliciting $100 founders' memberships to hire an architect and construct a clubhouse and by early 1928 over 1,000 had been collected. Funds were stored in a [[trust (law)|trust]] that couldn't be accessed until 2,000 memberships were sold. In February 1928, Clarke announced a 120 x 96' site had been chosen at the corner of 6th and University Streets. The committee hired the Seattle architectural firm of Baker, Vogel & Roush to design a building. Their plans were of an elegant twelve-story structure with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] influences. The building would cost around $1 million and construction was to begin in June 1928.<ref>\"Million-Dollar Athletic Club is Assured by City\" ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' February 29, 1928.

Pg. 22.</ref> The new committee chose to scrap the club's original design, now becoming dated, and hired architect Sherwood D.

Comer, then president of the club and a holder of major financial interest.<ref name=25th/> His first proposal was for an elaborate 12-story building in the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival Style]], unique to the region and similar in style to Seattle's Fox Theatre that Ford would later design.<ref>\"How Club Will Look\" ''Seattle Times'' July 29, 1928.

The new design was of an imposing 21-story [[art deco]] skyscraper with a central tower. It would be constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]] while the exterior consisted of brick and decorative [[terracotta]] tile and would be completely fireproof.<ref>\"Washington Athletic Club Building [Advertisement]\" ''Seattle Times'' January 6, 1930.

The 21-story WAC clubhouse opened in December 1930 and was designed in the [[Art Deco]] style by Seattle architect Sherwood D. Ford.\n\nThe five-story WAC includes a 25-yard pool, full-size basketball court, running track, handball and racquetball courts, and pilates and yoga studios. The top ten floors house the Inn at the WAC, a 109-room boutique hotel. The club also offers a full-service day spa and a wellness center with nutrition, physical therapy, and naturopathic services. The building is also home to three restaurants, a private ballroom, social areas, and numerous meeting spaces.\n\nThe idea of the [[Century 21 Exposition]] was first conceived by club members within the building in January 1955.<ref name=\"Emporis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=seattletower-seattle-wa-usa|title=Emporis.com page}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Washington Athletic Club became a City of Seattle Landmark,<ref>[https://www.cityofseattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/w.htm Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for W], Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle. Accessed October 8, 2010.</ref> and in 2018 its 6th Street building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Club's early formation and plans===\nIn mid 1928, Seattle newcomer and [[realtor]] Noel B. Clarke put together a committee of Seattle attorneys, [[capitalist]]s and bankers to raise money to form a new athletic club to serve the city's skyrocketing population.<ref name=25th/> They began soliciting $100 founders' memberships to hire an architect and construct a clubhouse and by early 1928 over 1,000 had been collected. Funds were stored in a [[trust (law)|trust]] that couldn't be accessed until 2,000 memberships were sold. In February 1928, Clarke announced a 120 x 96' site had been chosen at the corner of 6th and University Streets. The committee hired the Seattle architectural firm of Baker, Vogel & Roush to design a building. Their plans were of an elegant twelve-story structure with [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] influences. The building would cost around $1 million and construction was to begin in June 1928.<ref>\"Million-Dollar Athletic Club is Assured by City\" ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' February 29, 1928. Pg. 1, 3.</ref> By March 1928, only 1,200 of the needed 2,000 members had signed up for the new club, causing a delay in the plans.<ref>\"800 Join Seattle's New Athletic Club\" ''Seattle Times'' March 30, 1928.

Pg. 2.</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the original construction deadline, a new board of 26 of Seattle's most prominent businessmen came together to continue Clarke's work.<ref>\"Governors are Elected for Washington Athletic Club\" ''Seattle Times'' August 19, 1928. Pg. 22.</ref> The new committee chose to scrap the club's original design, now becoming dated, and hired architect Sherwood D. Ford to design something different at a new site chosen at the southwest corner of 6th Avenue and Union Street, owned by W.D. Comer, then president of the club and a holder of major financial interest.<ref name=25th/> His first proposal was for an elaborate 12-story building in the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival Style]], unique to the region and similar in style to Seattle's Fox Theatre that Ford would later design.<ref>\"How Club Will Look\" ''Seattle Times'' July 29, 1928.

Pg. 28.</ref> In late September 1928, plans had changed again and club officials brought in Kenneth McCleod, manager of the [[Olympic Club]] in [[San Francisco]], to consult with architect Ford to re-design the building in a way that would make optimal use of the lot.<ref>\"Olympic Club Manager to Help Locals\" ''Seattle Times'' September 25, 1928.

The new design was of an imposing 21-story [[art deco]] skyscraper with a central tower. It would be constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]] while the exterior consisted of brick and decorative [[terracotta]] tile and would be completely fireproof.<ref>\"Washington Athletic Club Building [Advertisement]\" ''Seattle Times'' January 6, 1930.

Duthie & Company|Wallace Bridge Company]], who also constructed the structures of the [[Harborview Medical Center]] in Seattle and the [[St. Johns Bridge]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], manufactured and assembled the building's steel frame.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago. The inmates are assigned to dig one hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \"builds their character\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\nAn argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse. Stanley's bad luck is blamed on the curse left on his great-great-grandfather and the Yelnats family easily believes in the power of this curse.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both Stanley and Elya are similar to fairy tale characters and are morally good, heroic protagonists who must overcome the challenges predestined for them.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both story lines are accompanied by a magic that is seen in the mountain stream, Madame Zeroni's song, and the healing power of the onions. Each of these elements in ''Holes'' mirror elements frequently found in fairy tales.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Names ===\nThroughout the novel, [[name]]s act as a theme that allows the characters to [[Dissociation (psychology)|disassociate]] their lives at Camp Green Lake from their lives back in the real world. Names also demonstrate [[irony]]\u2014Camp Green Lake is not actually a camp, it's located in a desert, and there is no lake. The \"campers\" all label themselves differently and identify with names such as Armpit and X-Ray and the guards are referred to as counselors.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago. The inmates are assigned to dig one hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \"builds their character\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\n=== Camp Green Lake ===\nThe Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \"interesting\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley befriends Zero, a [[street child]] and a descendant of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later).

The utility is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortis Ontario Inc., a division of [[Fortis Inc.|Fortis Inc]].

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide, and was positively reviewed for its performances, although the Earth-based elements of the film received some criticism. Two sequels have been released, ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' in 2017. A fourth film, ''Thor: Love and Thunder'', is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth.

Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After he confronts Odin, a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,{{refn|name=CosmicCube|group=N|Identified off-screen as the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref name=\"CosmicCube\" />}} which Fury says may hold untold power.

Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\"/> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier.\"<ref name=\"Warmoth\" /> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]: <br />A scientist and Thor's love interest. Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation.<ref name=\"portman\" /> When asked why she took the role, Portman replied, \"I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh's directing it, so I was just like, 'Kenneth Branagh doing ''Thor'' is super-weird, I've gotta do it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"portmanthorweird\" /> Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked, \"I signed on to do it before there was a script. And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. Really, I know it sounds silly, but it is those little things that makes girls think it's possible. It doesn't give them a [role] model of 'Oh, I just have to dress cute in movies'\".<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n[[File:TomHiddlestonApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity of the [[Loki|same name]]. Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' and ''[[Wallander (British TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> Initially, Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki. Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now.

And if you've seen any of the Frost Giants, you know that I am, of course, the [[Napoleon]] of Frost Giants. We've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. But, no. Can't you tell by the commanding presence? I am the boss\".<ref name=\"feoreaudio\"/> He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that \"during the breaks, Tony, myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on. So that was enormously helpful.\"<ref name=\"Seeton\" />\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Volstagg]]: <br />A member of the [[Warriors Three]], a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth.<ref name=\"three\" /> Stevenson previously worked with Kenneth Branagh in the 1998 film ''[[The Theory of Flight]]'', and with Marvel Studios as the titular character in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics. He's Falstaff with muscles.

It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time! I wouldn't like to do a whole movie of green screen, though. You kind of forget the plot a little\u2014like being in a Broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through\".<ref name=\"Gornstein\" /> Elba stated he has made a four-picture commitment with Marvel Studios.<ref name=Truitt /> Elba's casting prompted a proposed boycott by the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] and a debate amongst comic book fans, some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god. In response Elba called the debate \"ridiculous\".<ref name=\"Belonsky\" /><ref name=\"McClintock\" /><ref name=\"Child\" />\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as Darcy Lewis: <br />A political science major who is Jane Foster's intern.<ref name=\"darcy\" /> Dennings described her character as Foster's \"little helper [[gnome]]\".<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Dennings stated that her role was expanded during the rehearsal process.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> Dennings explained, \"She's kind of like a cute, clueless, little puppy or maybe a hamster. There wasn't much on the page for the Darcy role to begin with and I didn't even see a script before I took the job so I didn't really know who Darcy was at first. But she really evolved\u2014she's so much fun now even. She's very [[Scooby-Doo]] if that makes sense.

About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving. I know in my life, my karma is, 'If you don't like it, tough, move on.' And I move on. I'm a little like Odin myself\".<ref name=\"Boucher\" /> In May 2016, [[Mel Gibson]] stated he was approached about the role but \"didn't do it\".<ref name=\"MelGibson\" />\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Hogun]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an [[\u00c6sir]].<ref name=\"three\" /> Ray Stevenson said of Asano's character, \"He doesn't speak much but when he does, everybody shuts up.

He would like to think of himself, I was saying, as the [[R. Kelly]] of Asgard. He's a lover, not a fighter\". Dallas mentioned that [[Errol Flynn]] was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me. I watched a lot of his movies and kind of got that into my bones. I tried to bring out that little bit of Flynn-ness in it.

It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds.

Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to Digital Domain when creating [[J\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]].<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of [[Fuel VFX]], said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifr\u00f6st would look like, \"You can't [[Google]] what these things look like\u2014they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.

Branagh stated the footage contains \"things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide, and was positively reviewed for its performances, although the Earth-based elements of the film received some criticism. Two sequels have been released, ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' in 2017. A fourth film, ''Thor: Love and Thunder'', is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], [[Norway]], and seize the source of their power, the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].\n\nIn the present,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the latter of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After he confronts Odin, a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,{{refn|name=CosmicCube|group=N|Identified off-screen as the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref name=\"CosmicCube\" />}} which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:ChrisHemsworthApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemsworth promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] [[deity]] of the [[Thor|same name]].

Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\"/> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier.\"<ref name=\"Warmoth\" /> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]: <br />A scientist and Thor's love interest. Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation.<ref name=\"portman\" /> When asked why she took the role, Portman replied, \"I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh's directing it, so I was just like, 'Kenneth Branagh doing ''Thor'' is super-weird, I've gotta do it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"portmanthorweird\" /> Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked, \"I signed on to do it before there was a script. And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]].

Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' and ''[[Wallander (British TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> Initially, Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki. Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now.

And if you've seen any of the Frost Giants, you know that I am, of course, the [[Napoleon]] of Frost Giants. We've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. But, no. Can't you tell by the commanding presence? I am the boss\".<ref name=\"feoreaudio\"/> He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that \"during the breaks, Tony, myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on.

Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics.

It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time!

About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving.

Dallas mentioned that [[Errol Flynn]] was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me.

Jackson]], who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury at the end of the film ''Iron Man'', signed on to reprise the role in ''Thor'' as part of an unprecedented nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"samjackson\" /> In the same month, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.<ref name=\"Brady\" />\n\nHowever, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in ''Thor''. When asked why not Jackson explained, \"I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for ''Thor'' to serve as \"connective tissue\" for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Davis2\" />\n\nIn May 2009, [[Chris Hemsworth]] was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> The next day, Marvel announced that [[Tom Hiddleston]], who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> In July 2009, Marvel announced that [[Natalie Portman]] would portray Jane Foster.<ref name=\"portman\" /> [[Jaimie Alexander]] and [[Colm Feore]] were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> In an interview with Swedish news site ''Ystads Allehanda'', [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> By late October [[Anthony Hopkins]] had been cast as [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in the film.<ref name=\"hopkins\" /> The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by [[Stuart Townsend]], Hogun was to be played by [[Tadanobu Asano]] and Volstagg was to be played by [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]].<ref name=\"three\" /> [[Idris Elba]] was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall.<ref name=\"elba\" /> Natalie Portman revealed that [[Kat Dennings]] would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.<ref name=\"darcy\" /><ref name=\"kat\" />\n\nIn December 2009, [[Rene Russo]] was cast as [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigga]], Thor's stepmother and Odin's wife.<ref name=\"frigga\" /> Later that month, actors Joseph Gatt, [[Troy Brenna]], and Joshua Cox had been cast in the film, though none of their roles were revealed.<ref name=\"newactors\" /> In January 2010, Adriana Barraza had joined the film's cast, in a supporting capacity.<ref name=\"barraza\" /> Only days before filming began, Stuart Townsend was replaced by [[Joshua Dallas]] as Fandral, citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"townsendexit\" /> When ''[[Spider-Man 4]]''{{'}}s production stalled, Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of ''Thor'' by two weeks to May 6, 2011.<ref name=\"date\" />\n\nThe [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] introduced Marvel Entertainment, Kenneth Branagh, \"the screenwriter, and a few people on the design and production side of things\" to three physicists ([[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]], [[Kevin Hand]], and Jim Hartle), as well as physics student Kevin Hickerson, to provide a realistic science background for the Thor universe. The consultation resulted in a change in Jane Foster's profession, from nurse to particle physicist, and the terminology ([[Einstein-Rosen bridge]]) to describe the [[Bifrost Bridge]].<ref name=\"SEE\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:KennethBranaghApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films\u2014''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'', ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''\u2014at Raleigh's [[Manhattan Beach, California]] facility.<ref name=\"RaleighStudios\" /> ''Production Weekly'' reported that filming on Marvel's ''Thor'' was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] from March until late-April.<ref name=\"Baxter\" /> [[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2010.<ref name=\"thorfilmingbegins\" /> A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from ''Iron Man'' and ''Iron Man 2'' as Agent Coulson.<ref name=\"coulson\" /> In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with [[Del Mar, California]] to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for ''Thor'' involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film.<ref name=\"delmar\" /> On March 15, 2010, production of ''Thor'' moved to [[Galisteo, New Mexico]] where [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]],<ref name=\"CerroPelonRanch\" /> an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.<ref name=\"Bord\" /><ref name=\"Paramount\" />\n\nBranagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world: \"Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film\".<ref name=\"Boucher3\" />\n\nBy April, the prospect for filming parts of ''Thor'' in Del Mar, California had fallen through. Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed [[Northern California]] location to film a beachfront scene for the film. The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters.<ref name=\"Horn\" /> Filming wrapped on May 6, 2010.<ref name=\"huver\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Thor \u2013 Bifrost sequence.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = HubblePAO.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The film's [[Bifr\u00f6st]] travel sequences (top) were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography (bottom).\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots.<ref name=\"rehoots\" /> In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\".<ref name=\"Esmas\" /> Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants.<ref name=\"tait\" /> On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".<ref name=\"tait\" /> In April 2011, the [[IMAX Corporation]], Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in [[IMAX 3D]], continuing the partnership which began on ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"imax\" /> Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to Digital Domain when creating [[J\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]].<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of [[Fuel VFX]], said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifr\u00f6st would look like, \"You can't [[Google]] what these things look like\u2014they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.

The 2-disc and 3-disc packs includes a digital copy, the first in a series of [[Marvel One-Shots]], ''The Consultant'', and 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes.<ref name=\"DVD Release\" />\n\nBranagh said that the DVD includes at least 20 minutes of [[deleted scene]]s. Branagh stated the footage contains \"things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill in a little bit of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research.\"<ref name=\"Marshall4\" /> In its first week of release, ''Thor'' took the number one spot on Blu-ray/DVD sales chart and topped ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'''s rental chart for the week.<ref name=\"Arnold\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetAnnounced\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Boxset release\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Thor'' earned $181&nbsp;million in [[North America]] and $268.3&nbsp;million in other territories for a worldwide total of $449.3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\"/> It was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo4\" />\n\n''Thor'' earned $25.5 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, including $3.3 million from Thursday previews,<ref name=\"BOWknd1\" /> for a total weekend gross of $65.7 million. $6.2 million of the gross came from IMAX 3D, while 60% of the gross was from 3D screenings.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo5\" /><ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo6\" /> It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2011 in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo7\"/> and the highest-grossing comic-book film from May\u2013August 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo8\"/>\n\n''Thor''{{'}}s opening in Australia generated $5.8 million and placing second behind [[Universal Pictures]]' ''[[Fast Five]]''.
