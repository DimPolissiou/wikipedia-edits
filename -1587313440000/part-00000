Tiffany. He was one of the first and most prolific [[ophthalmologist]]s of Kansas City, living on Millionaire Row on [[Troost Avenue]]. He had traveled England and Scotland, and loved the [[Tudor architecture]] of castles, so he wanted to build one of his own at 100 Garfield Ave in Kansas City. Its floors and roof are made of reinforced concrete, with walls of solid stone from a quarry at 2nd and Lydia.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news | publisher=The Telegraph | title=Pendleton Heights Holiday Homes Tour and Artist\u2019s Market | date=December 5, 2019 | url=https://martincitytelegraph.com/2019/12/05/four-historic-homes-tours-offer-a-festive-start-to-holidays/ | accessdate=April 17, 2020}}</ref> It was completed in 1908, at 4,200 square feet, at a cost of {{US$|75000|1908}}.<ref name=\"Tiffany NEN\">{{cite web | first=Michael | last=Bushnell | title=The Northeast\u2019s \u201cTiffany Castle\u201d\n | url=http://northeastnews.net/pages/41036-2/ | date=October 3, 2018 | work=Northeast News | accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> The home has been sold eight times since, most recently listed for {{US$|600000}},<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fox4kc.com/news/tiffany-castle-on-the-market-for-those-looking-to-live-a-fairy-tale-life/|title=Tiffany Castle on the market for those looking to live a fairy tale|date=January 8, 2015}}</ref> and is part of the neighborhood's tradition of historical Christmas tours.<ref name=\"Tiffany KSHB\">{{cite web | first=Matt | last=Reeb | date=April 11, 2013 | work=KSHB | title=Tiffany Castle, nestled in Historic Northeast, is back on the market | url=http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/tiffany-castle-nestled-in-historic-northeast-kansas-city-is-looking-for-a-new-owner | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212083932/http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/tiffany-castle-nestled-in-historic-northeast-kansas-city-is-looking-for-a-new-owner | archivedate=December 12, 2013 | accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\nTiffany's major real estate endeavor was founding the town of [[Tiffany Springs, Kansas City, Missouri|Tiffany Springs]], which he intended to become a major spa resort to rival the successful [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]]. In the late 1880s, he bought 1,100 acres in central Platte County which includes an [[Artesian aquifer]]. His plans were not substantially realized, so the city of Kansas City eventually annexed most of this land, much of which became the [[Kansas City International Airport]].<ref name=\"Tiffany NEN\"/> Tiffany Springs is now a neighborhood of Kansas City.\n\n==See also==\n*[[City workhouse castle]], the other castle in Kansas City\n*[[List of landmarks in Kansas City]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Kansas City, Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Smuckola", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor copy editing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Castle"}

The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009.

The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality; one of many weaknesses in the EPI.<ref>Nor does the EPI gauge how well the biodiversity is faring compared to a pristine situation.</ref> Denmark performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) in the areas of environmental effects of fisheries (128)<ref>This is 128 out of only 136 countries, as only 136 countries are represented in this area of the EPI report.</ref> and forest management (96).

From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style.\nDuring the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, both in the capital and the provinces. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign \"Danish by Design\"], ''DDC''.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.\n\n=== Painting and photography ===\n{{Main|Danish art|Photography in Denmark}}\n[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Woman in Front of a Mirror'', (1841), by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]\n\nWhile Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u20131951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century.

The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, [[Denmark\u2013Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the [[First Schleswig War]]. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, Denmark lost the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]], however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum|further autonomy]] in 2009.

The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality; one of many weaknesses in the EPI.<ref>Nor does the EPI gauge how well the biodiversity is faring compared to a pristine situation.</ref> Denmark performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) in the areas of environmental effects of fisheries (128)<ref>This is 128 out of only 136 countries, as only 136 countries are represented in this area of the EPI report.</ref> and forest management (96).

[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign \"Danish by Design\"], ''DDC''.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.\n\n=== Painting and photography ===\n{{Main|Danish art|Photography in Denmark}}\n[[File:C W Eckersberg 1841 - Kvinde foran et spejl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Woman in Front of a Mirror'', (1841), by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]\n\nWhile Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th and 16th century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128170607/http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ |date=28 November 2009 }}.

These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u20131951), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century.

He started in 1955 as an assistant to [[John Lounsbery]] for ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. In 1957, Bluth left Disney only two years after being hired. Afterward, Bluth spent two and a half years in Argentina on a [[missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] for the [[LDS Church]]. He returned to the United States where he opened the Bluth Brothers Theater with his younger brother [[Toby Bluth|Fred]], though he occasionally worked for Disney.\n\nBluth returned to college and got a degree in English Literature from Brigham Young University. Bluth returned to the animation business and joined [[Filmation]] in 1967, working on layouts for ''[[The Archies]]'' and other projects. He returned full-time to Disney in 1971, where he worked on ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', and ''[[The Rescuers]]'', and directed animation on ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]''. His last involvement with Disney was the 1978 short ''[[The Small One]]''. Then he made and produced his first own short film, ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'', which takes place in his hometown Payson, Utah, during the 1940s as Banjo travels to [[Salt Lake City]] to find the urban world.\n\n==Independent years==\n\n===Early critical success===\nOn his 42nd birthday in 1979, Bluth, along with [[Gary Goldman]], [[John Pomeroy]], and nine fellow Disney animators, set out to start his own [[List of animation studios|animation studio]], [[Don Bluth Productions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Don|url=http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|publisher=Don Bluth Animation|accessdate=2012-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826222344/http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|archivedate=2012-08-26}}</ref><ref name=\"comicsjournal\">{{cite news|last=Heintjes|first=Tom|title=Newswatch: Bluth animation firm goes bankrupt|url=http://www.tcj.com/archive-viewer-issue-98/?pid=7634|accessdate=2012-07-30|newspaper=The Comics Journal No. 98|page=19|date=May 1985}}</ref> He drew a few (uncredited) scenes for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'' but left early in production.

The film would have had animated ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''-style vignettes featuring Beatles songs, similar to ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Not only did Don Bluth agree to it, he also planned on making it entirely in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Had the movie been made, it would have predated the ground-breaking 1995 Pixar film ''[[Toy Story]]'' by about eight years.

He started in 1955 as an assistant to [[John Lounsbery]] for ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. In 1957, Bluth left Disney only two years after being hired. Afterward, Bluth spent two and a half years in Argentina on a [[missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] for the [[LDS Church]]. He returned to the United States where he opened the Bluth Brothers Theater with his younger brother [[Toby Bluth|Fred]], though he occasionally worked for Disney.\n\nBluth returned to college and got a degree in English Literature from Brigham Young University. Bluth returned to the animation business and joined [[Filmation]] in 1967, working on layouts for ''[[The Archies]]'' and other projects. He returned full-time to Disney in 1971, where he worked on ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', and ''[[The Rescuers]]'', and directed animation on ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]''. His last involvement with Disney was the 1978 short ''[[The Small One]]''. Then he made and produced his first own short film, ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'', which takes place in his hometown Payson, Utah, during the 1940s as Banjo travels to [[Salt Lake City]] to find the urban world.\n\n==Independent years==\n\n===Early critical success===\nOn his 42nd birthday in 1979, Bluth, along with [[Gary Goldman]], [[John Pomeroy]], and nine fellow Disney animators, set out to start his own [[List of animation studios|animation studio]], [[Don Bluth Productions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Don|url=http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|publisher=Don Bluth Animation|accessdate=2012-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826222344/http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|archivedate=2012-08-26}}</ref><ref name=\"comicsjournal\">{{cite news|last=Heintjes|first=Tom|title=Newswatch: Bluth animation firm goes bankrupt|url=http://www.tcj.com/archive-viewer-issue-98/?pid=7634|accessdate=2012-07-30|newspaper=The Comics Journal No. 98|page=19|date=May 1985}}</ref> He drew a few (uncredited) scenes for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'' but left early in production.

They were initially intended to intercept fast [[capital ships]] such as the Japanese {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|4}} while also being capable of serving in a traditional [[battle line]] alongside slower battleships and act as its \"fast wing\".<ref name=\"Hough\">Hough, pp. 214\u2013216.</ref><ref name=sumrall41>Sumrall, p. 41</ref> The ''Iowa'' class was designed to meet the [[Second London Naval Treaty]]'s \"escalator clause\" limit of {{convert|45000|LT|-2|adj=on}} standard displacement. Four vessels, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, and {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, were completed; two more, {{USS|Illinois|BB-65|2}} and {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66|2}}, were [[Keel laying|laid down]] but canceled in 1945 and 1958 respectively before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958\u20131959.\n\nThe four ''Iowa''-class ships were the last battleships commissioned in the US Navy. All older US battleships were decommissioned by 1947 and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Registry]] (NVR) by 1963. Between the mid-1940s and the early 1990s, the ''Iowa''-class battleships fought in four major US wars. In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II, they served primarily as fast escorts for {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|}}s of the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] and also shelled Japanese positions. During the [[Korean War]], the battleships provided [[naval gunfire support]] (NGFS) for United Nations forces, and in 1968, ''New Jersey'' shelled [[Viet Cong]] and [[Vietnam People's Army]] forces in the [[Vietnam War]]. All four were reactivated and modernized at the direction of Congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the 1980s, as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] initiative. During [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991, ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' fired missiles and {{convert|16|in|0|adj=on}} guns at [[Iraq]]i targets.\n\nCostly to maintain, the battleships were decommissioned during the post-[[Cold War (1985\u20131991)|Cold War]] draw down in the early 1990s. All four were initially removed from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'', but the [[United States Congress]] compelled the Navy to reinstate two of them on the grounds that existing NGFS would be inadequate for [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]]. This resulted in a lengthy [[United States battleship retirement debate|debate]] over whether battleships should have a role in the modern navy. Ultimately, all four ships were stricken from the ''Naval Vessel Register'' and released for donation to non-profit organizations.  With the transfer of ''Iowa'' in 2012, all four are part of non-profit [[maritime museum]]s across the US.\n\n==Background==\nThe vessels that eventually became the ''Iowa''-class battleships were born from the US Navy's [[War Plan Orange]], a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners anticipated that the US fleet would engage and advance in the Central Pacific, with a long line of communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers. The chief concern was that the US Navy's traditional 21-knot battle line would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster carriers and their cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|0}} battlecruisers, which had been upgraded in the 1930s to [[fast battleship]]s. As a result, the US Navy envisioned a fast detachment of the battle line that could bring the Japanese fleet into battle. Even during the development process of the preceding {{sclass-|North Carolina|battleship|0}} and {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|0}} battleships, designs that could achieve over 30 knots in order to counter the threat of fast \"big gun\" ships were seriously considered.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 107</ref><ref name=friedman307>Friedman, p. 307</ref> At the same time, a special strike force consisting of fast battleships operating alongside carriers and destroyers was being envisaged; such a force could operate independently in advance areas and act as scouts. This concept eventually evolved into the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], though initially the carriers were believed to be subordinate to the battleship.<ref name=sumrall41/>\n\nAnother factor was the \"escalator clause\" of the [[Second London Naval Treaty]], which reverted the gun caliber limit from {{convert|14|in|0}} to {{convert|16|in|0}}. Japan had refused to sign the treaty and in particular refused to accept the 14-inch gun caliber limit or the 5:5:3 ratio of warship tonnage limits for Britain, United States, and Japan respectively. This resulted in the three treaty powers, the United States, Britain, and France, invoking the escalator clause after April 1937. Circulation of intelligence evidence in November 1937 of Japanese capital ships violating naval treaties caused the treaty powers to expand the escalator clause in June 1938, which amended the [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]]{{refn|Standard displacement, also known as \"Washington displacement\", is a specific term defined by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. It is the displacement of the ship complete, fully manned, engined, and equipped ready for sea, including all armament and ammunition, equipment, outfit, provisions and fresh water for crew, miscellaneous stores, and implements of every description that are intended to be carried in war, but without fuel or reserve boiler feed water on board.<ref>''Conference on the Limitation of Armament, 1922''.

Hart]], head of the [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]], following the planned invocation of the \"escalator clause\" that would permit maximum standard capital ship displacement of {{convert|45000|LT|-2}}. Using the additional {{convert|10000|LT|-2}} over previous designs, the studies included schemes for {{convert|27|knot|adj=on}} \"slow\" battleships that increased armament and protection as well as \"fast\" battleships capable of {{convert|33|knot}} or more. One of the \"slow\" designs was an expanded ''South Dakota''-class carrying either twelve [[16\"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|16-inch/45]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark 6 guns or nine [[18\"/48 caliber Mark 1 gun|{{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}}/48]] guns and with more armor and a power plant large enough to drive the larger ship through the water at the same 27-knot maximum speed as the ''South Dakota''s.{{refn|Also considered was the 16-inch/56 caliber gun, but this was dropped in March 1938 due to the weapon's weight.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 107-110.</ref>|group=N}} While the \"fast\" studies would result in the ''Iowa'' class, the \"slow\" design studies would eventually settle on twelve 16-inch guns and evolve into the design for the {{convert|60500|LT|adj=on}} {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|4}} after all treaty restrictions were removed following the start of World War II.<ref>Friedman, pp. 309, 311.</ref> Priority was given to the \"fast\" design in order to counter Japan's 30 knot {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser}}s, whose higher speed advantage over existing U.S. battleships might let them \"penetrate U.S. cruisers, thereby making it 'open season' on U.S. supply ships\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/built-to-last-iowa-class.html |title=Built To Last: Five Decades for the Iowa Class Battleship |author=Winston, George |date=15 September 2018 |website=War History Online |publisher=Timera Inc |access-date=12 January 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFor \"fast\" battleships, one such design, pursued by the Design Division section of the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]], was a \"cruiser-killer\". Beginning on 17 January 1938, under [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[A.J. Chantry]], the group drew up plans for ships with twelve 16-inch and twenty {{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}} guns, [[Panamax]] capability but otherwise unlimited displacement, a top speed of {{convert|35|kn}} and a range of {{convert|20000|nmi}} when traveling at the more economical speed of {{convert|15|kn}}. Their plan fulfilled these requirements with a ship of {{convert|50940|LT|t}} standard displacement, but Chantry believed that more could be done if the ship were to be this large; with a displacement greater than that of most battleships, its armor would have protected it only against the {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} weapons carried by [[heavy cruiser]]s.<ref name=\"Friedman309\">Friedman, p. 309.</ref>\n\nThree improved plans \u2013 \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" \u2013 were designed at the end of January. An increase in [[draft (hull)|draft]], vast additions to the armor,{{refn|The [[belt armor]] was increased from {{convert|8.1|in|0}} to {{convert|12.6|in}}; the [[Deck (ship)|deck armor]] from {{convert|2.3|in}} to {{convert|5|in|0}}; the splinter armor to {{convert|3.9|in}}; the [[Gun turret|turret armor]] from {{convert|9|in|0}} on the front, {{convert|6|in|0}} on the side, and 5 inches on the rear to {{convert|18|in|0}}, {{convert|10|in|0}} and {{convert|8|in|0}}, respectively.<ref name=\"Friedman310\" />|group=N}} and the substitution of twelve {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns in the secondary battery was common between the three designs. \"A\" was the largest, at {{convert|59060|LT}} standard, and was the only one to still carry the twelve 16-inch guns in four triple turrets (3-gun turrets according to US Navy). It required {{cvt|277000|shp|lk=on}} to make {{convert|32.5|knot}}. \"B\" was the smallest at {{convert|52707|LT}} standard; like \"A\" it had a top speed of 32.5&nbsp;knots, but \"B\" only required {{cvt|225000|shp}} to make this speed. It also carried only nine 16-inch guns, in three triple turrets. \"C\" was similar but it added {{cvt|75000|shp}} (for a total of {{cvt|300000|shp}}), to make the original requirement of 35&nbsp;knots. The weight required for this and a longer belt \u2013 {{convert|512|ft}}, compared with {{convert|496|ft}} for \"B\" \u2013 meant that the ship was {{convert|55771|LT}} standard.<ref name=\"Friedman310\">Friedman, p. 310.</ref>\n\n===Design history===\nIn March 1938, the General Board followed the recommendations of the Battleship Design Advisory Board, which was composed of the naval architect [[William Francis Gibbs]], [[William Hovgaard]] (then president of [[New York Shipbuilding]]), John Metten, Joseph W. Powell, and the long-retired [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] and former Chief of the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] [[Joseph Strauss (admiral)|Joseph Strauss]]. The board requested an entirely new design study, again focusing on increasing the size of the {{cvt|35000|LT|adj=on}} ''South Dakota''-class. The first plans made for this indicated that {{convert|30|kn}} was possible on a standard displacement of about {{convert|37600|LT}}. {{convert|33|kn}} could be bought with {{cvt|220000|shp}} and a standard displacement of around {{convert|39230|LT}}, which was well below the London Treaty's \"escalator clause\" maximum limit of {{convert|45000|LT|-2}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 271, 309.</ref>\n\nThese designs were able to convince the General Board that a reasonably well-designed and balanced 33-knot \"fast\" battleship was possible within the terms of the \"escalator clause\". However, further studies revealed major problems with the estimates. The speed of the ships meant that more [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] would be needed both fore and amidships, the latter requiring an additional foot of armored freeboard. Along with this came the associated weight in supporting these new strains: the structure of the ship had to be reinforced and the power plant enlarged to avoid a drop in speed. In all, about {{convert|2400|LT|-1}} had to be added, and the large margin the navy designers had previously thought they had \u2013 roughly {{convert|5000|LT|-1}} \u2013 was suddenly vanishing.<ref name=\"Friedman309-310\">Friedman, pp. 309\u201310.</ref>  The draft of the ships was also allowed to increase, which enabled the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] to narrow and thus reduced required power (since lower beam-to-draft ratio reduces [[wave-making resistance]]). This also allowed the ships to be shortened which reduced weight.<ref>Friedman, pp. 310\u201311.</ref>\n\nWith the additional displacement, the General Board was incredulous that a tonnage increase of {{convert|10000|LT|-2}} would allow only the addition of {{convert|6|kn}} over the ''South Dakota''s. Rather than retaining the 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns used in the ''South Dakota''s, they ordered that the preliminary design would have to include the more powerful but significantly heavier [[16\"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun|16-inch/50 caliber Mark 2 guns]] left over from the canceled {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}}s and {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} battleships of the early 1920s.<ref>Friedman, pp. 310\u201311.</ref>\n\nThe 50-caliber gun weighed some {{convert|400|LT|0}} more than the 45-caliber did; due to the greater outside diameter of the barrel, the [[barbette]] diameter also had to be increased from {{convert|37|ft|3|in|1|adj=on}} to {{convert|39|ft|4|in|1}} so the total weight gain was about {{convert|2000|LT|-1}}, putting the ship at a total of {{convert|46551|LT}} \u2013 well over the 45,000&nbsp;long&nbsp;ton limit. An apparent savior appeared in a Bureau of Ordnance preliminary design for a turret that could carry the 50-caliber guns while also fit in the smaller barbette of the 45-caliber gun turret. Other weight savings were achieved through thinning some armor elements and substituting construction steel with armor-grade [[Special Treatment Steel]] (STS) in certain areas. The net savings reduced the preliminary design displacement to {{convert|44560|LT}} standard, though the margin remained tight. This breakthrough was shown to the General Board as part of a series of designs on 2 June 1938.<ref name=\"Friedman311\">Friedman, p. 311.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Bureau of Ordnance continued working on the turret with the larger barbette, while the Bureau of Construction and Repair utilized the smaller barbettes in the contract design of the new battleships. As the bureaus were independent of one another, they did not realize that the two plans could not go together until November 1938, when the contract design was in the final stages of refinement. By this time, the ships could not use the larger barbette, as it would require extensive alterations to the design and would result in substantial weight penalties. The General Board was astounded; one member asked the head of the Bureau of Ordnance if it had occurred to him that Construction and Repair would have wanted to know what turret his subordinates were working on \"as a matter of common sense\". A complete scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within the Bureau of Ordnance were able to design a new 50-caliber gun, the [[16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|Mark 7]], that was both lighter and smaller in outside diameter; this allowed it to be placed in a turret that would fit in the smaller barbette. The redesigned 3-gun turret, equipped as it was with the Mark 7 naval gun, provided an overall weight saving of nearly {{convert|850|LT|0}} to the overall design of the ''Iowa'' class.

By the time it reaches the LP turbine, it has no more than 50 psi (300 kPa) of pressure left. The LP turbine increases efficiency and power by extracting the last little bit of energy from the steam. After leaving the LP turbine, the exhaust steam passes into a condenser and is then returned as feed water to the boilers. Water lost in the process is replaced by three evaporators, which can make a total of 60,000 US gallons per day (3  liters per second) of fresh water. After the boilers have had their fill, the remaining fresh water is fed to the ship's potable water systems for drinking, showers, hand washing, cooking, etc. All of the urinals and all but one of the toilets on the ''Iowa'' class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh water. The turbines, especially the HP turbine, can turn at 2,000 rpm; their shafts drive through reduction gearing that turns the propeller shafts at speeds up to 225 rpm, depending upon the desired speed of the ship.<ref>Sumrall, pp. 118\u201319</ref>  The ''Iowa''s were outfitted with four [[propeller|screws]]: the outboard pair consisting of four-bladed propellers {{cvt|18.25|ft}} in diameter and inboard pair consisting of five-bladed propellers {{cvt|17|ft|2}} in diameter. The propeller designs were adopted after earlier testing had determined that propeller [[cavitation]] caused a drop in efficiency at speeds over {{cvt|30|kn}}.  The two inner shafts were housed in skegs to smooth the flow of water to the propellers and improve the structural strength of the stern.<ref>Davis, pp. 5\u20136.</ref><ref>Sumrall, p. 138</ref>\n\nThe four engine rooms each has a pair of 1,250&nbsp;kW Ship's Service Turbine Generators (SSTGs), providing the ship with a total non-emergency electrical power of 10,000&nbsp;kW at 450 volts alternating current. Additionally, the vessels have a pair of 250&nbsp;kW emergency diesel generators.<ref name=\"Friedman449\"/> To allow battle-damaged electrical circuits to be repaired or bypassed, the lower decks of the ship have a Casualty Power System whose large 3-wire cables and wall outlets called \"biscuits\" can be used to reroute power.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 142\u201343</ref>\n\n===Electronics (1943\u201369) ===\nThe earliest search radars installed were the SK air-search radar and SG surface-search radar during World War II. They were located on the mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the ''Iowa'' class was updated to make use of these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships' radar systems were augmented with the installation of the SP height finder on the main mast. In 1952, [[AN/SPS-10]] surface-search radar and [[AN/SPS-6]] air-search radar replaced the SK and SG radar systems, respectively. Two years later the SP height finder was replaced by the [[AN/SPS-8]] height finder, which was installed on the main mast of the battleships.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 141\u201342</ref>\n\nIn addition to these search and navigational radars, the ''Iowa'' class were also outfitted with a variety of [[Ship gun fire-control system|fire control systems]] for their gun systems, and later for their missile systems. Beginning with their commissioning, the battleships made use of a trio of [[Ship Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 38 Gun Fire Control System|Mk 38 gun fire control systems]] to direct the 16-inch guns and a quartet of [[Ship Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 37 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS)|Mk 37 gun fire control systems]] to direct the 5-inch gun batteries. These systems were upgraded over time, but remained the cornerstones of the combat radar systems on the ''Iowa'' class during their careers.<ref name=\"Janes 92\" /> The range estimation of these gunfire control systems provided a significant accuracy advantage over earlier ships with optical rangefinders; this was demonstrated off [[Truk Atoll]] on 16 February 1944, when the ''Iowa'' engaged the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Nowaki|1940|6}} at a range of {{convert|35700|yd|km nmi}} and [[Salvo|straddled]] her, setting the record for the longest-ranged straddle in history.<ref name=\"straddle\">{{cite magazine|last1=Fischer|first1=Brad D.|last2=Jurens |first2= W.

The ships were also equipped with the Mark III [[identification, friend or foe]] (IFF) system, which were replaced by the Mark X when the ships were overhauled in 1955. When the ''New Jersey'' was reactivated in 1968 for the Vietnam War, she was outfitted with the ULQ-6 ECM system.<ref>Sumrall, pp. 115-19</ref>\n\n=== Armor ===\n[[File:USS New Jersey armor citadel.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=A large gray wall, with an open door visible on the left. To the right, the door way into the ship is visible, revealing several inches of gray armor.|A view of the door and {{convert|17.3|in|mm|adj=on|0}} thick armored [[conning tower]] of the battleship ''New Jersey'']]\n\nLike all battleships, the ''Iowa''s carried heavy armor protection against shellfire and bombs with significant underwater protection against torpedoes. The ''Iowa''{{'}}s \"[[All or nothing (armor)|all-or-nothing]]\" armor scheme was largely modeled on that of the preceding ''South Dakota'' class, and designed to give a [[zone of immunity]] against fire from 16-inch/45-caliber guns between {{convert|18000|and|30000|yd|m mi}} away. The protection system consists of Class A face-hardened [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented]] (K.C.) armor and Class B homogeneous Krupp-type armor; furthermore, [[special treatment steel]] (STS), a high-tensile structural steel with armor properties comparable to Class B, was extensively used in the hull plating to increase protection.<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/index_nathan/metalprpsept2009.htm Table of Metallurgical Properties of Naval Armor and Construction Materials]. Nathan Okun</ref>\n\nThe citadel consisting of the magazines and engine rooms were protected by an STS outer hull plating {{convert|1.5|in}} thick and a Class A armor belt {{convert|12.1|in|0}} thick mounted on {{convert|0.875|in|adj=on}} STS backing plate; the armor belt is sloped at 19 degrees, equivalent to {{convert|17.3|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} of vertical class B armor at 19,000 yards. The armor belt extends to the triple bottom, where the Class B lower portion tapers to {{convert|1.62|in}}. The ends of the armored citadel are closed by {{convert|11.3|in|0|adj=on}} vertical Class A traverse bulkheads for ''Iowa'' and ''New Jersey''. The traverse bulkhead armor on ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' was increased to {{convert|14.5|in|0}}; this extra armor provided protection from fire directly ahead, which was considered more likely given the high speed of the ''Iowa''s. The deck armor consists of a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} STS weather deck, a combined {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=mid|-thick}} Class B and STS main armor deck, and a {{convert|0.63|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} STS splinter deck. Over the magazines, the splinter deck is replaced by a {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} STS third deck that separates the magazine from the main armored deck.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\" /> The powder magazine rooms are separated from the turret platforms by a pair of 1.5-inch STS annular bulkheads under the barbettes for flashback protection.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\" /> The installation of armor on the ''Iowa''s also differed from those of earlier battleships in that the armor was installed while the ships were still \"on the way\" rather than after the ships had been launched.<ref>Stillwell, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe ''Iowa''s had heavily protected main battery turrets, with {{convert|19.5|in|0|adj=on}} Class B and STS face, {{convert|9.5|in|0|adj=on}} Class A sides, {{convert|12|in|0|adj=on}} Class A rear, and {{convert|7.25|in|0|adj=on}} Class B roof. The turret barbettes' armor is Class A with {{convert|17.3|in|0}} abeam and {{convert|11.6|in|0}} facing the centerline, extending down to the main armor deck. The conning tower armor is Class B with {{convert|17.3|in|0}} on all sides and {{convert|7.25|in|0}} on the roof. The secondary battery turrets and handling spaces were protected by {{convert|2.5|in|0}} of STS. The propulsion shafts and steering gear compartment behind the citadel had considerable protection, with {{convert|13.5|in|0|adj=on}} Class A side strake and {{convert|5.6-6.2|in|0|adj=on}} roof.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\">Friedman, p. 314.</ref><ref name=\"GD144-48\"/>\n\nThe armor's immunity zone shrank considerably against guns equivalent to their own 16-inch/50-caliber guns armed with the Mk. 8 armor-piercing shell due to the weapon's increased muzzle velocity and improved shell penetration; increasing the armor would have increased weight and reduced speed, a compromise that the General Board was not willing to make.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\"/>\n\nThe ''Iowa''s{{'}} torpedo defense was based on the ''South Dakota''s{{'}} design, with some modifications. The system is an internal \"bulge\" that consists of four longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull plating with a system depth of {{convert|17.9|ft|2}} to absorb the energy of a torpedo warhead. The extension of the armor belt to the triple bottom, where it tapers to a thickness of {{convert|1.62|in}}, serves as one of the torpedo bulkheads and was hoped to add to protection. The torpedo bulkheads were designed to elastically deform to absorb energy and several compartments were liquid loaded in order to disrupt the gas bubble. The outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo, with the outer two compartments absorbing the shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by the lower armored belt and the empty compartment behind it. However, the Navy discovered in caisson tests in 1939 that the initial design for this torpedo defense system was actually ''less'' effective than the previous design used on the ''North Carolina''s{{'}} due to the rigidity of the lower armor belt causing leakage into adjacent compartments. To mitigate the effects, the welded joint between the lower armor belt and the triple bottom was reinforced with buttstaps, and the liquid loading system was altered so that the two outermost compartments were filled, while the two inboard compartments were void spaces.<ref>Friedman, p. 285.</ref><ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 93</ref> ''Iowa''s{{'}} system was also improved over the ''South Dakota''s{{'}} through closer spacing of the traverse bulkheads, greater thickness of the lower belt at the triple bottom joint, and increased total volume of the \"bulge\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Jurens|first1=W.J.|last2=Morss |first2=Strafford |year=2016|title=The Washington Naval Treaty and the Armor and Protective Plating of USS Massachusetts|magazine=Warship International|publisher=International Naval Research Organization|location=Toledo, OH|volume=53|issue=4|pages=289\u201394}}</ref> The system was further modified for the last two ships of the class, ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'', by eliminating knuckles along certain bulkheads; this was estimated to improve the strength of the system by as much as 20%.<ref>Sumrall, pp. 132</ref>\n\nBased on costly lessons in the Pacific theater, concerns were raised about the ability of the armor on these battleships to withstand aerial bombing, particularly high altitude bombing using armor piercing bombs. Developments such as the [[Norden bombsight]] further fueled these concerns. While the design of the ''Iowa''s was too far along to adequately address this issue, experience in the Pacific theater eventually demonstrated that high altitude unguided bombing was ineffective against maneuvering warships.<ref name=\"Lyon\" /><ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 141</ref>\n\n=== Aircraft (1943\u201369) ===\nWhen they were commissioned during World War II, the ''Iowa''-class battleships came equipped with two [[aircraft catapult]]s designed to launch [[floatplane]]s. Initially, the ''Iowa''s carried the [[Vought]] [[Vought OS2U Kingfisher|OS2U Kingfisher]]<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\">Stillwell, p. 296.</ref> and [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] [[Curtiss SC Seahawk|SC Seahawk]],<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\" /><ref name=\"janes\">Bridgeman, pp. 221\u201322.</ref> both of which were employed to spot for the battleship's main gun batteries&nbsp;\u2013 and, in a secondary capacity, perform search-and-rescue missions.\n\nBy the time of the Korean War, helicopters had replaced floatplanes and the [[Sikorsky H-5|Sikorsky HO3S-1]] helicopter was employed.<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\" /> ''New Jersey'' made use of the [[Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH]] drone for her Vietnam war deployment in 1968\u201369.<ref name=\"debate\" />\n\n== Conversion proposals ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction= vertical\n| align  = left\n| width  = 220\n| footer =\n| image1 = Iowa class aircraft carrier.jpg\n| alt1   = A black and white blueprint of a ship with a flat deck designed to launch and recover airplanes.

These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability and \u2013 in the case of ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' \u2013 a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.<ref name=\"Friedman190\" /><ref name=\"ICAC\" />\n\nInitially, the ''Iowa'' class was to consist of only four battleships with hull numbers BB-61 to BB-64: ''Iowa'', ''New Jersey'', ''Missouri'', and ''Wisconsin''. However, changing priorities during World War II resulted in the battleship hull numbers BB-65 {{USS|Montana|BB-67|2}} and BB-66 {{USS|Ohio|BB-68|2}} being reordered as ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' respectively; ''Montana'' and ''Ohio'' were reassigned to hull numbers BB-67 and BB-68. At the time these two battleships were to be built a proposal was put forth to have them constructed as aircraft carriers rather than fast battleships. The plan called for the ships to be rebuilt to include a flight deck and an armament suite similar to that placed aboard the {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s that were at the time under construction in the United States.<ref name=\"Friedman190\" /><ref name=\"ICAC\" /> Ultimately, nothing came of the design proposal to rebuild these two ships as aircraft carriers and they were cleared for construction as fast battleships to conform to the ''Iowa''-class design, though they differed from the earlier four that were built. Eventually, the {{sclass-|Cleveland|cruiser|0}} [[light cruiser]]s were selected for the aircraft-carrier conversion. Nine of these light cruisers would be rebuilt as {{sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|0}} light aircraft carriers.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Aircraft Carriers'', p. 191.</ref>\n\nAfter the surrender of the [[Empire of Japan]], construction on ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' stopped. ''Illinois'' was eventually scrapped, but ''Kentucky''{{'}}s construction had advanced enough that several plans were proposed to complete ''Kentucky'' as a guided missile battleship (BBG) by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system.<ref name=\"Kentucky II\">{{cite web |title= USS Kentucky (BB-66) Naval Vessel Register |url= http://www.nvr.navy.mil/SHIPDETAILS/SHIPSDETAIL_BB_66_1838.HTML |publisher= [[United States Navy]] |accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"math\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/World%27s%20Fastest%20Battleships.pdf |title=Development of the World's Fastest Battleships |accessdate=16 December 2010 |last=Rogers |first=J.

Mendenhall, Chairman of the Ship[s] Characteristics Board<!--[sources disagree on whether it's \"Ship\" or \"Ships\" or \"Ships'\"]--> (SCB); Mendehall proposed a plan that called for $15\u201330&nbsp;million to be spent to allow ''Kentucky'' to be completed as a guided-missile battleship (BBG) carrying eight [[SSM-N-8 Regulus|SSM-N-8 Regulus II]] guided missiles with a range of {{convert|1000|nmi}}. He also suggested Terrier or [[RIM-8 Talos]] launchers to supplement the AA guns and proposed nuclear (instead of conventional) shells for the 16-inch guns.<ref>Garzke, p. 204.</ref> This never materialized,<ref name=\"Polmar128\">Polmar, p. 128.</ref> and ''Kentucky'' was ultimately sold for scrap in 1958, although her bow was used to repair her sister ''Wisconsin'' after a collision on 6 May 1956, earning her the nickname ''WisKy''.<ref name=\"Kentucky II\" />\n\nIn 1954, the Long Range Objectives Group of the United States Navy suggested converting the ''Iowa''-class ships to BBGs. In 1958, the Bureau of Ships offered a proposal based on this idea. This replaced the 5- and 16-inch gun batteries with \"two Talos twin missile systems, two [[RIM-24 Tartar]] twin missile systems, an [[RUR-5 ASROC]] antisubmarine missile launcher, and a Regulus II installation with four missiles\",<ref>Garzke, p. 209.</ref> as well as [[flagship]] facilities, sonar, helicopters, and fire-control systems for the Talos and Tartar missiles. In addition to these upgrades, {{cvt|8600|LT}} of additional fuel oil was also suggested to serve in part as ballast for the battleships and for use in refueling destroyers and cruisers. Due to the estimated cost of the overhaul ($178\u2013193 million) this proposal was rejected as too expensive; instead, the SCB suggested a design with one Talos, one Tartar, one ASROC and two Regulus launchers and changes to the superstructure, at a cost of up to $85&nbsp;million. This design was later revised to accommodate the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile, which in turn resulted in a study of two schemes by the SCB. In the end, none of these proposed conversions for the battleships were ever authorized.<ref>Garzke, p. 210.</ref> Interest in converting the ''Iowa''s into guided-missile battleships began to deteriorate in 1960, because the hulls were considered too old and the conversion costs too high.<ref name=\"G212\">Garzke, p. 212.</ref> Nonetheless, additional conversion proposals \u2013 including one to install the [[AN/SPY-1]] [[Aegis Combat System]] radar<ref name=\"Polmar128\" /> on the battleships \u2013 were suggested in 1962, 1974 and 1977, but as before, these proposals failed to gain the needed authorization.<ref>Garzke, p. 213.</ref> This was due, in part, to the possibility that sensitive electronics within {{cvt|200|ft}} of any 16-inch gun muzzle may be damaged from overpressure.<ref name=\"G212\" />\n\n== 1980s refit ==\n[[File:Kirov class cruiser.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large surface warship with its bow pointed to the left.

At one point, the NATO [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects from firing the main battery.<ref name=\"GOA1\">{{cite web |last= Horan |first= Donald J. |url= http://archive.gao.gov/f0102/115403.pdf |title= Update of the Issues Concerning the Proposed Reactivation of the Iowa class battleships and the Aircraft Carrier Oriskany |date= 20 April 1981 |accessdate =16 December 2010 |publisher =United States General Accounting Office |pages=3\u201318 }}</ref> To supplement the anti-aircraft capabilities of the ''Iowa''s, five [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missile]] firing positions were installed.

The AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system was replaced with the [[AN/SPS-49]] radar set (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search radar set was replaced by the [[AN/SPS-67]] search radar.<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\" />\n\nBy the Korean War, jet engines had replaced propellers on aircraft, which severely limited the ability of the 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. ''New Jersey'' received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx Close in Weapon System]] (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20&nbsp;mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.<ref name=\"Janes 92\">Sharpe, p. 732.</ref><ref name=\"Stillwell 62.2\">Stillwell, p. 304.</ref>\n[[File:Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.jpg|thumb|alt=A large airborne machine photographed in flight from the ground looking up.

To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and to fire the Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the [[AN/SLQ-25 Nixie]] to be used as a lure against enemy torpedoes, an [[AN/SLQ-32 Electronic Warfare Suite|SLQ-32]] electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a [[Mark 36 SRBOC]] system to fire [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]] rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.<ref name=\"Janes 92\" /><ref name=\"Stillwell 62.2\" />\n\nAside from the electronics added for weaponry control, all four battleships were outfitted with a communications suite used by both cruisers and guided missile cruisers in service at the time.<ref name=\"Polmar128\" /> This communication suite included the OE-82 antenna for satellite communications,<ref>Sumrall, p. 122.</ref> but did not include the [[Naval Tactical Data System]].<ref name=\"Polmar128\" />\n\n=== Aircraft (1982\u20131992) ===\n[[File:Iowa drone.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The rear deck of ship, with a large partially erect net visible near the center of the image.

At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600&nbsp;ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100&nbsp;submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition.<ref>Holland, p. 184</ref> While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, the decision was made to deactivate the four recommissioned ''Iowa''-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.{{refn|\"As stated in our testimony, there is current pressure to greatly reduce the defense budget, which led to the decision to retire two battleships. Because the battleships are costly to maintain (about $58 million to operate annually, according to the Navy) and difficult to man, and because of the unanswered safety and missions-related questions, the two remaining battleships seem to be top candidates for decommissioning as the United States looks for ways to scale back its forces. If the Navy also decommissions the remaining two battleships, the Navy's entire $33 million request for 16-inch ammunition could be denied, and the $4.4 million request for 5-inch/38&nbsp;caliber gun ammunition could reduced by $3.6 million.\"<ref name=\"GAO_Potential_Reductions\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d23t8/142247.pdf |title=Defense Budget: Potential Reductions to DOD's Ammunition Budgets |publisher=U.S. [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] |date=17 September 1990 |page=29 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref>|group=N}}\n\n[[File:USS New Jersey BB-62 salvo Jan 1953.jpeg|thumb|left|''New Jersey'' fires a nine gun salvo of 16-inch shells into an enemy troop concentration near [[Kaesong]], Korea|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a large caliber gunship on the left side of the picture with the main guns pointed to the top right side of the image.

''Missouri'' conducted her trials off New York with shakedown and battle practice in Chesapeake Bay before transferring to the Pacific Fleet, where she screened US aircraft carriers involved in offensive operations against the Japanese before reporting to Okinawa to shell the island in advance of the planned landings. Following the bombardment of Okinawa, ''Missouri'' turned her attention to the Japanese homeland islands of [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]], performing shore bombardment and screening US carriers involved in combat operations. She became a symbol of the US Navy's victory in the Pacific when representatives of the Empire of Japan boarded the battleship to sign the documents of unconditional [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender]] to the Allied powers in September 1945. After World War II, ''Missouri'' conducted largely uneventful training and operational cruises until suffering a grounding [[1950 USS Missouri grounding incident|accident]]. In 1950, she was dispatched to Korea in response to the outbreak of the Korean War. ''Missouri'' served two tours of duty in Korea providing shore bombardment. She was decommissioned in 1956. She spent many years at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in Bremerton, Washington. Reactivated in 1984, as part of the 600-ship Navy plan, ''Missouri'' was sent on operational cruises until being assigned to [[Operation Earnest Will]] in 1988.

They were initially intended to intercept fast [[capital ships]] such as the Japanese {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|4}} while also being capable of serving in a traditional [[battle line]] alongside slower battleships and act as its \"fast wing\".<ref name=\"Hough\">Hough, pp. 214\u2013216.</ref><ref name=sumrall41>Sumrall, p. 41</ref> The ''Iowa'' class was designed to meet the [[Second London Naval Treaty]]'s \"escalator clause\" limit of {{convert|45000|LT|-2|adj=on}} standard displacement. Four vessels, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, and {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}}, were completed; two more, {{USS|Illinois|BB-65|2}} and {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66|2}}, were [[Keel laying|laid down]] but canceled in 1945 and 1958 respectively before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958\u20131959.\n\nThe four ''Iowa''-class ships were the last battleships commissioned in the US Navy. All older US battleships were decommissioned by 1947 and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Registry]] (NVR) by 1963. Between the mid-1940s and the early 1990s, the ''Iowa''-class battleships fought in four major US wars. In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II, they served primarily as fast escorts for {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|}}s of the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] and also shelled Japanese positions. During the [[Korean War]], the battleships provided [[naval gunfire support]] (NGFS) for United Nations forces, and in 1968, ''New Jersey'' shelled [[Viet Cong]] and [[Vietnam People's Army]] forces in the [[Vietnam War]]. All four were reactivated and modernized at the direction of Congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the 1980s, as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] initiative. During [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991, ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' fired missiles and {{convert|16|in|0|adj=on}} guns at [[Iraq]]i targets.\n\nCostly to maintain, the battleships were decommissioned during the post-[[Cold War (1985\u20131991)|Cold War]] draw down in the early 1990s. All four were initially removed from the ''[[Naval Vessel Register]]'', but the [[United States Congress]] compelled the Navy to reinstate two of them on the grounds that existing NGFS would be inadequate for [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]]. This resulted in a lengthy [[United States battleship retirement debate|debate]] over whether battleships should have a role in the modern navy. Ultimately, all four ships were stricken from the ''Naval Vessel Register'' and released for donation to non-profit organizations.  With the transfer of ''Iowa'' in 2012, all four are part of non-profit [[maritime museum]]s across the US.\n\n==Background==\nThe vessels that eventually became the ''Iowa''-class battleships were born from the US Navy's [[War Plan Orange]], a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners anticipated that the US fleet would engage and advance in the Central Pacific, with a long line of communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers. The chief concern was that the US Navy's traditional 21-knot battle line would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster carriers and their cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser|0}} battlecruisers, which had been upgraded in the 1930s to [[fast battleship]]s. As a result, the US Navy envisioned a fast detachment of the battle line that could bring the Japanese fleet into battle. Even during the development process of the preceding {{sclass-|North Carolina|battleship|0}} and {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|0}} battleships, designs that could achieve over 30 knots in order to counter the threat of fast \"big gun\" ships were seriously considered.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 107</ref><ref name=friedman307>Friedman, p. 307</ref> At the same time, a special strike force consisting of fast battleships operating alongside carriers and destroyers was being envisaged; such a force could operate independently in advance areas and act as scouts. This concept eventually evolved into the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], though initially the carriers were believed to be subordinate to the battleship.<ref name=sumrall41/>\n\nAnother factor was the \"escalator clause\" of the [[Second London Naval Treaty]], which reverted the gun caliber limit from {{convert|14|in|0}} to {{convert|16|in|0}}. Japan had refused to sign the treaty and in particular refused to accept the 14-inch gun caliber limit or the 5:5:3 ratio of warship tonnage limits for Britain, United States, and Japan respectively. This resulted in the three treaty powers, the United States, Britain, and France, invoking the escalator clause after April 1937. Circulation of intelligence evidence in November 1937 of Japanese capital ships violating naval treaties caused the treaty powers to expand the escalator clause in June 1938, which amended the [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]]{{refn|Standard displacement, also known as \"Washington displacement\", is a specific term defined by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. It is the displacement of the ship complete, fully manned, engined, and equipped ready for sea, including all armament and ammunition, equipment, outfit, provisions and fresh water for crew, miscellaneous stores, and implements of every description that are intended to be carried in war, but without fuel or reserve boiler feed water on board.<ref>''Conference on the Limitation of Armament, 1922''.

Hart]], head of the [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]], following the planned invocation of the \"escalator clause\" that would permit maximum standard capital ship displacement of {{convert|45000|LT|-2}}. Using the additional {{convert|10000|LT|-2}} over previous designs, the studies included schemes for {{convert|27|knot|adj=on}} \"slow\" battleships that increased armament and protection as well as \"fast\" battleships capable of {{convert|33|knot}} or more. One of the \"slow\" designs was an expanded ''South Dakota''-class carrying either twelve [[16\"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun|16-inch/45]] [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark 6 guns or nine [[18\"/48 caliber Mark 1 gun|{{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}}/48]] guns and with more armor and a power plant large enough to drive the larger ship through the water at the same 27-knot maximum speed as the ''South Dakota''s.{{refn|Also considered was the 16-inch/56 caliber gun, but this was dropped in March 1938 due to the weapon's weight.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 107-110.</ref>|group=N}} While the \"fast\" studies would result in the ''Iowa'' class, the \"slow\" design studies would eventually settle on twelve 16-inch guns and evolve into the design for the {{convert|60500|LT|adj=on}} {{sclass-|Montana|battleship|4}} after all treaty restrictions were removed following the start of World War II.<ref>Friedman, pp. 309, 311.</ref> Priority was given to the \"fast\" design in order to counter Japan's 30 knot {{sclass-|Kong\u014d|battlecruiser}}s, whose higher speed advantage over existing U.S. battleships might let them \"penetrate U.S. cruisers, thereby making it 'open season' on U.S. supply ships\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/built-to-last-iowa-class.html |title=Built To Last: Five Decades for the Iowa Class Battleship |author=Winston, George |date=15 September 2018 |website=War History Online |publisher=Timera Inc |access-date=12 January 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFor \"fast\" battleships, one such design, pursued by the Design Division section of the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]], was a \"cruiser-killer\". Beginning on 17 January 1938, under [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[A.J. Chantry]], the group drew up plans for ships with twelve 16-inch and twenty {{convert|5|in|0|adj=on}} guns, [[Panamax]] capability but otherwise unlimited displacement, a top speed of {{convert|35|kn}} and a range of {{convert|20000|nmi}} when traveling at the more economical speed of {{convert|15|kn}}. Their plan fulfilled these requirements with a ship of {{convert|50940|LT|t}} standard displacement, but Chantry believed that more could be done if the ship were to be this large; with a displacement greater than that of most battleships, its armor would have protected it only against the {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} weapons carried by [[heavy cruiser]]s.<ref name=\"Friedman309\">Friedman, p. 309.</ref>\n\nThree improved plans \u2013 \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" \u2013 were designed at the end of January.

It required {{cvt|277000|shp|lk=on}} to make {{convert|32.5|knot}}. \"B\" was the smallest at {{convert|52707|LT}} standard; like \"A\" it had a top speed of 32.5&nbsp;knots, but \"B\" only required {{cvt|225000|shp}} to make this speed. It also carried only nine 16-inch guns, in three triple turrets. \"C\" was similar but it added {{cvt|75000|shp}} (for a total of {{cvt|300000|shp}}), to make the original requirement of 35&nbsp;knots. The weight required for this and a longer belt \u2013 {{convert|512|ft}}, compared with {{convert|496|ft}} for \"B\" \u2013 meant that the ship was {{convert|55771|LT}} standard.<ref name=\"Friedman310\">Friedman, p. 310.</ref>\n\n===Design history===\nIn March 1938, the General Board followed the recommendations of the Battleship Design Advisory Board, which was composed of the naval architect [[William Francis Gibbs]], [[William Hovgaard]] (then president of [[New York Shipbuilding]]), John Metten, Joseph W. Powell, and the long-retired [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] and former Chief of the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] [[Joseph Strauss (admiral)|Joseph Strauss]]. The board requested an entirely new design study, again focusing on increasing the size of the {{cvt|35000|LT|adj=on}} ''South Dakota''-class. The first plans made for this indicated that {{convert|30|kn}} was possible on a standard displacement of about {{convert|37600|LT}}. {{convert|33|kn}} could be bought with {{cvt|220000|shp}} and a standard displacement of around {{convert|39230|LT}}, which was well below the London Treaty's \"escalator clause\" maximum limit of {{convert|45000|LT|-2}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 271, 309.</ref>\n\nThese designs were able to convince the General Board that a reasonably well-designed and balanced 33-knot \"fast\" battleship was possible within the terms of the \"escalator clause\". However, further studies revealed major problems with the estimates. The speed of the ships meant that more [[Freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] would be needed both fore and amidships, the latter requiring an additional foot of armored freeboard. Along with this came the associated weight in supporting these new strains: the structure of the ship had to be reinforced and the power plant enlarged to avoid a drop in speed. In all, about {{convert|2400|LT|-1}} had to be added, and the large margin the navy designers had previously thought they had \u2013 roughly {{convert|5000|LT|-1}} \u2013 was suddenly vanishing.<ref name=\"Friedman309-310\">Friedman, pp. 309\u201310.</ref>  The draft of the ships was also allowed to increase, which enabled the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] to narrow and thus reduced required power (since lower beam-to-draft ratio reduces [[wave-making resistance]]). This also allowed the ships to be shortened which reduced weight.<ref>Friedman, pp. 310\u201311.</ref>\n\nWith the additional displacement, the General Board was incredulous that a tonnage increase of {{convert|10000|LT|-2}} would allow only the addition of {{convert|6|kn}} over the ''South Dakota''s. Rather than retaining the 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns used in the ''South Dakota''s, they ordered that the preliminary design would have to include the more powerful but significantly heavier [[16\"/50 caliber Mark 2 gun|16-inch/50 caliber Mark 2 guns]] left over from the canceled {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}}s and {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} battleships of the early 1920s.<ref>Friedman, pp. 310\u201311.</ref>\n\nThe 50-caliber gun weighed some {{convert|400|LT|0}} more than the 45-caliber did; due to the greater outside diameter of the barrel, the [[barbette]] diameter also had to be increased from {{convert|37|ft|3|in|1|adj=on}} to {{convert|39|ft|4|in|1}} so the total weight gain was about {{convert|2000|LT|-1}}, putting the ship at a total of {{convert|46551|LT}} \u2013 well over the 45,000&nbsp;long&nbsp;ton limit. An apparent savior appeared in a Bureau of Ordnance preliminary design for a turret that could carry the 50-caliber guns while also fit in the smaller barbette of the 45-caliber gun turret. Other weight savings were achieved through thinning some armor elements and substituting construction steel with armor-grade [[Special Treatment Steel]] (STS) in certain areas. The net savings reduced the preliminary design displacement to {{convert|44560|LT}} standard, though the margin remained tight. This breakthrough was shown to the General Board as part of a series of designs on 2 June 1938.<ref name=\"Friedman311\">Friedman, p. 311.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Bureau of Ordnance continued working on the turret with the larger barbette, while the Bureau of Construction and Repair utilized the smaller barbettes in the contract design of the new battleships. As the bureaus were independent of one another, they did not realize that the two plans could not go together until November 1938, when the contract design was in the final stages of refinement. By this time, the ships could not use the larger barbette, as it would require extensive alterations to the design and would result in substantial weight penalties. The General Board was astounded; one member asked the head of the Bureau of Ordnance if it had occurred to him that Construction and Repair would have wanted to know what turret his subordinates were working on \"as a matter of common sense\". A complete scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within the Bureau of Ordnance were able to design a new 50-caliber gun, the [[16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|Mark 7]], that was both lighter and smaller in outside diameter; this allowed it to be placed in a turret that would fit in the smaller barbette. The redesigned 3-gun turret, equipped as it was with the Mark 7 naval gun, provided an overall weight saving of nearly {{convert|850|LT|0}} to the overall design of the ''Iowa'' class. The contract design displacement subsequently stood at {{convert|45155|LT}} standard and {{convert|56088|LT}} full load.<ref>Sumrall, p. 35</ref><ref name=\"Lyon\">Lyon, p. 240.</ref>\n\nIn May 1938, the United States Congress passed the [[Second Vinson Act]] which \"mandated a 20% increase in strength of the [[United States Navy]]\".<ref name=\"Fastest\">Rogers: Fastest Battleships</ref> The act was sponsored by [[Carl Vinson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who was Chairman of the House Naval Affairs and Armed Services Committee.<ref name=\"Vinson\">Vinson: Congressional biography</ref> The Second Vinson Act updated the provisions of the [[Vinson-Trammell Act]] of 1934 and the Naval Act of 1936, which had \"authorized the construction of the first American battleships in 17 years\", based on the provisions of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930;<ref name=\"Fastest\" /> this act was quickly signed by President [[Franklin D.

These revisions included changing the design of the foremast, replacing the original [[1.1\"/75 caliber gun|{{convert|1.1|in|1|adj=on}}/75-caliber gun]]s that were to be used for [[anti-aircraft]] (AA) work with [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|{{cvt|20|mm|2}}/70&nbsp;caliber Oerlikon cannons]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm|2}}/56&nbsp;caliber Bofors guns]], and moving the [[Operations room|combat information center]] into the armored hull.<ref>Stillwell, p. 16.</ref> Additionally, in November 1939, the New York Navy Yard greatly modified the internal subdivision of the machinery rooms, as tests had shown the underwater protection in these rooms to be inadequate. The longitudinal subdivision of these rooms was doubled, and the result of this was clearly beneficial: \"The prospective effect of flooding was roughly halved and the number of uptakes and hence of openings in the third deck greatly reduced.\" Although the changes meant extra weight and increasing the beam by {{convert|1|ft}} to {{convert|108|ft|2|in}}, this was no longer a major issue; [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] had renounced the Second London Naval Treaty soon after the beginning of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Friedman, pp. 313\u201314.</ref> The design displacement was {{convert|45873|LT}} standard, approximately 2% overweight, when ''Iowa'' and ''New Jersey'' were laid down in June and September 1940.

The steam is first passed through the HP turbine which turns at up to 2,100  rpm. The steam, largely depleted at this point, is then passed through a large conduit to the LP turbine. By the time it reaches the LP turbine, it has no more than 50 psi (300 kPa) of pressure left. The LP turbine increases efficiency and power by extracting the last little bit of energy from the steam. After leaving the LP turbine, the exhaust steam passes into a condenser and is then returned as feed water to the boilers. Water lost in the process is replaced by three evaporators, which can make a total of 60,000 US gallons per day (3  liters per second) of fresh water. After the boilers have had their fill, the remaining fresh water is fed to the ship's potable water systems for drinking, showers, hand washing, cooking, etc. All of the urinals and all but one of the toilets on the ''Iowa'' class flush with saltwater in order to conserve fresh water. The turbines, especially the HP turbine, can turn at 2,000 rpm; their shafts drive through reduction gearing that turns the propeller shafts at speeds up to 225 rpm, depending upon the desired speed of the ship.<ref>Sumrall, pp. 118\u201319</ref>  The ''Iowa''s were outfitted with four [[propeller|screws]]: the outboard pair consisting of four-bladed propellers {{cvt|18.25|ft}} in diameter and inboard pair consisting of five-bladed propellers {{cvt|17|ft|2}} in diameter.

They were located on the mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the ''Iowa'' class was updated to make use of these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships' radar systems were augmented with the installation of the SP height finder on the main mast. In 1952, [[AN/SPS-10]] surface-search radar and [[AN/SPS-6]] air-search radar replaced the SK and SG radar systems, respectively. Two years later the SP height finder was replaced by the [[AN/SPS-8]] height finder, which was installed on the main mast of the battleships.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 141\u201342</ref>\n\nIn addition to these search and navigational radars, the ''Iowa'' class were also outfitted with a variety of [[Ship gun fire-control system|fire control systems]] for their gun systems, and later for their missile systems. Beginning with their commissioning, the battleships made use of a trio of [[Ship Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 38 Gun Fire Control System|Mk 38 gun fire control systems]] to direct the 16-inch guns and a quartet of [[Ship Gun Fire Control Systems#MK 37 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS)|Mk 37 gun fire control systems]] to direct the 5-inch gun batteries. These systems were upgraded over time, but remained the cornerstones of the combat radar systems on the ''Iowa'' class during their careers.<ref name=\"Janes 92\" /> The range estimation of these gunfire control systems provided a significant accuracy advantage over earlier ships with optical rangefinders; this was demonstrated off [[Truk Atoll]] on 16 February 1944, when the ''Iowa'' engaged the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Nowaki|1940|6}} at a range of {{convert|35700|yd|km nmi}} and [[Salvo|straddled]] her, setting the record for the longest-ranged straddle in history.<ref name=\"straddle\">{{cite magazine|last1=Fischer|first1=Brad D.|last2=Jurens |first2= W.

The ships were also equipped with the Mark III [[identification, friend or foe]] (IFF) system, which were replaced by the Mark X when the ships were overhauled in 1955. When the ''New Jersey'' was reactivated in 1968 for the Vietnam War, she was outfitted with the ULQ-6 ECM system.<ref>Sumrall, pp. 115-19</ref>\n\n=== Armor ===\n[[File:USS New Jersey armor citadel.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=A large gray wall, with an open door visible on the left. To the right, the door way into the ship is visible, revealing several inches of gray armor.|A view of the door and {{convert|17.3|in|mm|adj=on|0}} thick armored [[conning tower]] of the battleship ''New Jersey'']]\n\nLike all battleships, the ''Iowa''s carried heavy armor protection against shellfire and bombs with significant underwater protection against torpedoes. The ''Iowa''{{'}}s \"[[All or nothing (armor)|all-or-nothing]]\" armor scheme was largely modeled on that of the preceding ''South Dakota'' class, and designed to give a [[zone of immunity]] against fire from 16-inch/45-caliber guns between {{convert|18000|and|30000|yd|m mi}} away. The protection system consists of Class A face-hardened [[Krupp cemented armour|Krupp cemented]] (K.C.) armor and Class B homogeneous Krupp-type armor; furthermore, [[special treatment steel]] (STS), a high-tensile structural steel with armor properties comparable to Class B, was extensively used in the hull plating to increase protection.<ref>[http://www.navweaps.com/index_nathan/metalprpsept2009.htm Table of Metallurgical Properties of Naval Armor and Construction Materials]. Nathan Okun</ref>\n\nThe citadel consisting of the magazines and engine rooms were protected by an STS outer hull plating {{convert|1.5|in}} thick and a Class A armor belt {{convert|12.1|in|0}} thick mounted on {{convert|0.875|in|adj=on}} STS backing plate; the armor belt is sloped at 19 degrees, equivalent to {{convert|17.3|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} of vertical class B armor at 19,000 yards. The armor belt extends to the triple bottom, where the Class B lower portion tapers to {{convert|1.62|in}}. The ends of the armored citadel are closed by {{convert|11.3|in|0|adj=on}} vertical Class A traverse bulkheads for ''Iowa'' and ''New Jersey''. The traverse bulkhead armor on ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' was increased to {{convert|14.5|in|0}}; this extra armor provided protection from fire directly ahead, which was considered more likely given the high speed of the ''Iowa''s. The deck armor consists of a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} STS weather deck, a combined {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=mid|-thick}} Class B and STS main armor deck, and a {{convert|0.63|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} STS splinter deck. Over the magazines, the splinter deck is replaced by a {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} STS third deck that separates the magazine from the main armored deck.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\" /> The powder magazine rooms are separated from the turret platforms by a pair of 1.5-inch STS annular bulkheads under the barbettes for flashback protection.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\" /> The installation of armor on the ''Iowa''s also differed from those of earlier battleships in that the armor was installed while the ships were still \"on the way\" rather than after the ships had been launched.<ref>Stillwell, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe ''Iowa''s had heavily protected main battery turrets, with {{convert|19.5|in|0|adj=on}} Class B and STS face, {{convert|9.5|in|0|adj=on}} Class A sides, {{convert|12|in|0|adj=on}} Class A rear, and {{convert|7.25|in|0|adj=on}} Class B roof. The turret barbettes' armor is Class A with {{convert|17.3|in|0}} abeam and {{convert|11.6|in|0}} facing the centerline, extending down to the main armor deck. The conning tower armor is Class B with {{convert|17.3|in|0}} on all sides and {{convert|7.25|in|0}} on the roof. The secondary battery turrets and handling spaces were protected by {{convert|2.5|in|0}} of STS. The propulsion shafts and steering gear compartment behind the citadel had considerable protection, with {{convert|13.5|in|0|adj=on}} Class A side strake and {{convert|5.6-6.2|in|0|adj=on}} roof.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\">Friedman, p. 314.</ref><ref name=\"GD144-48\"/>\n\nThe armor's immunity zone shrank considerably against guns equivalent to their own 16-inch/50-caliber guns armed with the Mk. 8 armor-piercing shell due to the weapon's increased muzzle velocity and improved shell penetration; increasing the armor would have increased weight and reduced speed, a compromise that the General Board was not willing to make.<ref name=\"Friedman, p. 314\"/>\n\nThe ''Iowa''s{{'}} torpedo defense was based on the ''South Dakota''s{{'}} design, with some modifications. The system is an internal \"bulge\" that consists of four longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull plating with a system depth of {{convert|17.9|ft|2}} to absorb the energy of a torpedo warhead. The extension of the armor belt to the triple bottom, where it tapers to a thickness of {{convert|1.62|in}}, serves as one of the torpedo bulkheads and was hoped to add to protection. The torpedo bulkheads were designed to elastically deform to absorb energy and several compartments were liquid loaded in order to disrupt the gas bubble. The outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo, with the outer two compartments absorbing the shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by the lower armored belt and the empty compartment behind it. However, the Navy discovered in caisson tests in 1939 that the initial design for this torpedo defense system was actually ''less'' effective than the previous design used on the ''North Carolina''s{{'}} due to the rigidity of the lower armor belt causing leakage into adjacent compartments. To mitigate the effects, the welded joint between the lower armor belt and the triple bottom was reinforced with buttstaps, and the liquid loading system was altered so that the two outermost compartments were filled, while the two inboard compartments were void spaces.<ref>Friedman, p. 285.</ref><ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 93</ref> ''Iowa''s{{'}} system was also improved over the ''South Dakota''s{{'}} through closer spacing of the traverse bulkheads, greater thickness of the lower belt at the triple bottom joint, and increased total volume of the \"bulge\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Jurens|first1=W.J.|last2=Morss |first2=Strafford |year=2016|title=The Washington Naval Treaty and the Armor and Protective Plating of USS Massachusetts|magazine=Warship International|publisher=International Naval Research Organization|location=Toledo, OH|volume=53|issue=4|pages=289\u201394}}</ref> The system was further modified for the last two ships of the class, ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'', by eliminating knuckles along certain bulkheads; this was estimated to improve the strength of the system by as much as 20%.<ref>Sumrall, pp. 132</ref>\n\nBased on costly lessons in the Pacific theater, concerns were raised about the ability of the armor on these battleships to withstand aerial bombing, particularly high altitude bombing using armor piercing bombs. Developments such as the [[Norden bombsight]] further fueled these concerns. While the design of the ''Iowa''s was too far along to adequately address this issue, experience in the Pacific theater eventually demonstrated that high altitude unguided bombing was ineffective against maneuvering warships.<ref name=\"Lyon\" /><ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 141</ref>\n\n=== Aircraft (1943\u201369) ===\nWhen they were commissioned during World War II, the ''Iowa''-class battleships came equipped with two [[aircraft catapult]]s designed to launch [[floatplane]]s. Initially, the ''Iowa''s carried the [[Vought]] [[Vought OS2U Kingfisher|OS2U Kingfisher]]<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\">Stillwell, p. 296.</ref> and [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] [[Curtiss SC Seahawk|SC Seahawk]],<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\" /><ref name=\"janes\">Bridgeman, pp. 221\u201322.</ref> both of which were employed to spot for the battleship's main gun batteries&nbsp;\u2013 and, in a secondary capacity, perform search-and-rescue missions.\n\nBy the time of the Korean War, helicopters had replaced floatplanes and the [[Sikorsky H-5|Sikorsky HO3S-1]] helicopter was employed.<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\" /> ''New Jersey'' made use of the [[Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH]] drone for her Vietnam war deployment in 1968\u201369.<ref name=\"debate\" />\n\n== Conversion proposals ==\n{{multiple image\n| direction= vertical\n| align  = left\n| width  = 220\n| footer =\n| image1 = Iowa class aircraft carrier.jpg\n| alt1   = A black and white blueprint of a ship with a flat deck designed to launch and recover airplanes.

These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability and \u2013 in the case of ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' \u2013 a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.<ref name=\"Friedman190\" /><ref name=\"ICAC\" />\n\nInitially, the ''Iowa'' class was to consist of only four battleships with hull numbers BB-61 to BB-64: ''Iowa'', ''New Jersey'', ''Missouri'', and ''Wisconsin''. However, changing priorities during World War II resulted in the battleship hull numbers BB-65 {{USS|Montana|BB-67|2}} and BB-66 {{USS|Ohio|BB-68|2}} being reordered as ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' respectively; ''Montana'' and ''Ohio'' were reassigned to hull numbers BB-67 and BB-68. At the time these two battleships were to be built a proposal was put forth to have them constructed as aircraft carriers rather than fast battleships. The plan called for the ships to be rebuilt to include a flight deck and an armament suite similar to that placed aboard the {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s that were at the time under construction in the United States.<ref name=\"Friedman190\" /><ref name=\"ICAC\" /> Ultimately, nothing came of the design proposal to rebuild these two ships as aircraft carriers and they were cleared for construction as fast battleships to conform to the ''Iowa''-class design, though they differed from the earlier four that were built. Eventually, the {{sclass-|Cleveland|cruiser|0}} [[light cruiser]]s were selected for the aircraft-carrier conversion. Nine of these light cruisers would be rebuilt as {{sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|0}} light aircraft carriers.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Aircraft Carriers'', p. 191.</ref>\n\nAfter the surrender of the [[Empire of Japan]], construction on ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' stopped. ''Illinois'' was eventually scrapped, but ''Kentucky''{{'}}s construction had advanced enough that several plans were proposed to complete ''Kentucky'' as a guided missile battleship (BBG) by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system.<ref name=\"Kentucky II\">{{cite web |title= USS Kentucky (BB-66) Naval Vessel Register |url= http://www.nvr.navy.mil/SHIPDETAILS/SHIPSDETAIL_BB_66_1838.HTML |publisher= [[United States Navy]] |accessdate=14 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"math\">{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/World%27s%20Fastest%20Battleships.pdf |title=Development of the World's Fastest Battleships |accessdate=16 December 2010 |last=Rogers |first=J.

Mendenhall, Chairman of the Ship[s] Characteristics Board<!--[sources disagree on whether it's \"Ship\" or \"Ships\" or \"Ships'\"]--> (SCB); Mendehall proposed a plan that called for $15\u201330&nbsp;million to be spent to allow ''Kentucky'' to be completed as a guided-missile battleship (BBG) carrying eight [[SSM-N-8 Regulus|SSM-N-8 Regulus II]] guided missiles with a range of {{convert|1000|nmi}}. He also suggested Terrier or [[RIM-8 Talos]] launchers to supplement the AA guns and proposed nuclear (instead of conventional) shells for the 16-inch guns.<ref>Garzke, p. 204.</ref> This never materialized,<ref name=\"Polmar128\">Polmar, p. 128.</ref> and ''Kentucky'' was ultimately sold for scrap in 1958, although her bow was used to repair her sister ''Wisconsin'' after a collision on 6 May 1956, earning her the nickname ''WisKy''.<ref name=\"Kentucky II\" />\n\nIn 1954, the Long Range Objectives Group of the United States Navy suggested converting the ''Iowa''-class ships to BBGs. In 1958, the Bureau of Ships offered a proposal based on this idea. This replaced the 5- and 16-inch gun batteries with \"two Talos twin missile systems, two [[RIM-24 Tartar]] twin missile systems, an [[RUR-5 ASROC]] antisubmarine missile launcher, and a Regulus II installation with four missiles\",<ref>Garzke, p. 209.</ref> as well as [[flagship]] facilities, sonar, helicopters, and fire-control systems for the Talos and Tartar missiles. In addition to these upgrades, {{cvt|8600|LT}} of additional fuel oil was also suggested to serve in part as ballast for the battleships and for use in refueling destroyers and cruisers. Due to the estimated cost of the overhaul ($178\u2013193 million) this proposal was rejected as too expensive; instead, the SCB suggested a design with one Talos, one Tartar, one ASROC and two Regulus launchers and changes to the superstructure, at a cost of up to $85&nbsp;million. This design was later revised to accommodate the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile, which in turn resulted in a study of two schemes by the SCB. In the end, none of these proposed conversions for the battleships were ever authorized.<ref>Garzke, p. 210.</ref> Interest in converting the ''Iowa''s into guided-missile battleships began to deteriorate in 1960, because the hulls were considered too old and the conversion costs too high.<ref name=\"G212\">Garzke, p. 212.</ref> Nonetheless, additional conversion proposals \u2013 including one to install the [[AN/SPY-1]] [[Aegis Combat System]] radar<ref name=\"Polmar128\" /> on the battleships \u2013 were suggested in 1962, 1974 and 1977, but as before, these proposals failed to gain the needed authorization.<ref>Garzke, p. 213.</ref> This was due, in part, to the possibility that sensitive electronics within {{cvt|200|ft}} of any 16-inch gun muzzle may be damaged from overpressure.<ref name=\"G212\" />\n\n== 1980s refit ==\n[[File:Kirov class cruiser.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large surface warship with its bow pointed to the left.

The AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system was replaced with the [[AN/SPS-49]] radar set (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search radar set was replaced by the [[AN/SPS-67]] search radar.<ref name=\"Stillwell 62.1\" />\n\nBy the Korean War, jet engines had replaced propellers on aircraft, which severely limited the ability of the 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. ''New Jersey'' received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations.

At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600&nbsp;ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100&nbsp;submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified.

''Missouri'' conducted her trials off New York with shakedown and battle practice in Chesapeake Bay before transferring to the Pacific Fleet, where she screened US aircraft carriers involved in offensive operations against the Japanese before reporting to Okinawa to shell the island in advance of the planned landings. Following the bombardment of Okinawa, ''Missouri'' turned her attention to the Japanese homeland islands of [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]], performing shore bombardment and screening US carriers involved in combat operations. She became a symbol of the US Navy's victory in the Pacific when representatives of the Empire of Japan boarded the battleship to sign the documents of unconditional [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|surrender]] to the Allied powers in September 1945. After World War II, ''Missouri'' conducted largely uneventful training and operational cruises until suffering a grounding [[1950 USS Missouri grounding incident|accident]]. In 1950, she was dispatched to Korea in response to the outbreak of the Korean War. ''Missouri'' served two tours of duty in Korea providing shore bombardment. She was decommissioned in 1956.

As a result, hip hop stands as one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan and the line between it and [[pop music]] is frequently blurred.\n\n==History of hip hop in Japan==\nAlthough rather informal and small scale, the early days of Japanese hip hop provide the history for the emergence of the [[cultural movement]]. Early hip hop was not led by corporate interests, but rather was largely ignored by large [[record companies]] and performance venues. In this respect, Japanese hip-hop offers a representation of [[cultural globalization]], as it expanded despite criticism on the part of record companies and major media outlets. The history shows that certain kinds of cultural exchange are not initiated through cultural understanding, but instead from some interaction that can incite a desire to learn, to participate, and to contribute individuality. In Japan, this motivation to represent individuality was [[breakdancing]], which was one of the leading edges of hip-hop at the time.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Condry, Ian (2007). Hip Hop Japan.

According to Takagi Kan, a first generation Japanese MC, \"I couldn't tell what was with the rap and the [[DJing]]...but with the breakdancing and [[graffiti art]], you could understand it visually. Or rather, it wasn't understanding so much as, 'Whoa, that's cool' ''[kakkoii]''. With rap and DJing, I couldn't imagine what could be cool about it.\" Dancing has a visual impact that everyone can understand, when it comes to dance there is not a language barrier. Break dancing represented the foundation for the spread of Japanese hip-hop and served as a medium for globalization.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/>\n\nAs in Germany, much of Japan was introduced to [[hip hop]] in the fall of 1983 with the movie ''[[Wild Style]]''.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/condry/www/jhh/ |title=Japanese Hip-Hop, by Ian Condry (MIT) |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> The film is \"the classic hip-hop flick, full of great subway shots, breakdancing, freestyle MCing and rare footage of one of the godfathers of hip-hop, [[Grandmaster Flash]], pulling off an awesome scratch-mix set on a pair of ancient turntables.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084904/plotsummary|title=Wild Style (1983) : Plot Summary|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> The popularity of the film led to many of the artists involved in it to make a trip to Japan to promote the film and they even performed in some of the department stores while they were there.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" />\n\nShortly after, Japanese took up breakdancing in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Yoyogi Park]], where street musicians gather every Sunday to perform.

Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, but with the increase in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as it would be hard to rap in Japanese.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" />\n\nStreet musicians began to breakdance in [[Yoyogi Park]], including [[DJ Krush]] who has become a world-renowned DJ after arising from the Yoyogi Park scene. In 1986 an all hip hop club opened in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. While interest in hip-hop in Japan grew some during the 1980s and early 1990s, the rap scene remained fairly small and rather marginalized.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\">Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006.</ref> One reason for the rap scene to remain so small and a little bit less popular compared to hip hop is because of the fact that the [[Japanese language]] does \"not contain stress accents and sentences must end with one of a few simple verb endings.\"<ref>Condry, Ian.

The first hit was [[Schadaraparr]]'s \"Kon'ya wa b\u016bgi bakku\" (Boogie Back Tonight) by Scha Dara Parr and [[Kenji Ozawa|Ozawa Kenji]], followed by East End X Yuri's \"Da. Yo. Ne.\" and \"Maicca,\" which each sold a million copies.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /> This sudden popularity of J-rap, which was largely characterized as party rap, sparked a debate over 'realness' and authenticity between commercial and underground hip-hop artists.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" />\n\nPopular brands in Japan during this period also collaborated with multiple hip hop artist.

Hip-hop style and Japanese rap has been an enormous commercial success in Japan. In a 2003 interview with the [[BBC]], Tokyo record-store owner, Hideaki Tamura noted \"Japanese hip-hop really exploded in the last two, three years. I never thought there would be a time when Japanese records could outsell American ones but it's happening.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated11\">{{cite news|last=Takatsuki |first=Yo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3324409.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Japan grows its own hip-hop |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=2003-12-17 |accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> Additionally, a huge number of new scenes have developed. These include \u201crock rap to hard core gangsta, spoken word/poetry, to conscious, old school, [[techno]] rap, antigovernment, pro-marijuana, heavymetal-sampled rap, and so on.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" />\n\nTamura points to a shift in Japanese hip hop, when artists began to focus on issues pertinent to Japanese society, versus previous styles and subjects that were copied from US hip hop culture. For Japan, the style of hip hop was much more appealing than topics popular in American hip hop, such as violence.<ref name=\"autogenerated8\" /> Ian Condry, on the other hand, focuses on an interplay between local and global hip hop within the genba of Japan. For Condry, Japanese hip hop was born out of simultaneous localization and globalization of hip hop culture, rather than a shift between the two binary factors.<ref>Condry, Ian.

Shows like '[[Soul Train]]' spread the African style of on-going dance that would soon be picked up by varying cultures all over the world. It is this style of dance that laid the foundation for the globalization of African culture due to its universal criteria. Anyone can dance to soul music, which is not the case in terms of rapping, b-boying, etc. As movies like '[[Flashdance]]' (1983) reached the islands, more and more young people began dancing on the street and other public arenas, which added to its cultural integration. Soon, Japanese culture was ready to alter the very structure of their language in order to partake in hip hop.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n[[Image:YOKOBLING.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Japanese hip-hop fan sports an [[Afro]] and shows some Japanese style [[bling]]]]\nHip hop was thought to have originally become popular in Japan because the Japanese people wanted to imitate Africans. The Japanese would hear these rapper's music spinning in clubs, exposing to them a small, narrow view of West Coast hip hop. It was not only the music they latched onto, however. They came to love the entire hip hop culture, including the loose-fitting clothes, graffiti writing, and break dancing.

Pan derives from the American company [[Pan American World Airways]] and combines with the Japanese word ''pan'' meaning bread (thus these girls were also euphemistically known as bread girls) The more attractive girls often had to service \"white bread\" or white soldiers and were known as ''yagipan'' with ''yagi'' being the Japanese word for goat, a white hairy animal. Less attractive girls serviced \"black bread\" or black soldiers and were known as ''burapan'' with ''bura'' deriving from the Japanese word [[burakumin]] relating to [[social stigma]].<ref name=\"\u73fe\u4ee3\u7528\u8a9e\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Cite journal|last=Condry |first=Ian |title=Yellow B-Boys, Black Culture, and Hip-Hop in Japan: Toward a Transnational Cultural Politics of Race  |journal=Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique |volume=15 |pages=637\u2013671 |year=2007 |doi=10.1215/10679847-2007-008|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/positions/v015/15.3condry.html}}</ref> Therefore, a ''burapan'' is literally \"a woman who prostitutes herself for black men.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nAlthough the word has come to describe a trend of dress and culture modeled after Africans, it is inherently problematic because of its origins.

Before hip hop, the Japanese had embraced jazz, rock n roll and funk. It is important to note however, despite the seemingly racist tendencies toward Africans and the simultaneous embrace of black culture, the Japanese have a very different construction of racial ideology then the US. Whereas the white versus black dichotomy typifies the racial system in the US, the Japanese construct their identities in terms of nationalism. Rather than identifying strongly with a color, Japanese tradition speaks to a homogeneous society that places foreigners in the \"other category.\"{{Dubious|date=May 2013}}  Because of this context, \"jiggers\" and the young teens who wear blackface rebel by embracing individual identities that are different from the norm.<ref name=\"autogenerated13\">Wood, Joe. \"The Yellow Negro.\" Transition 73: 40-67</ref>\n\n=== Blackface ===\nPeople who tan in order to get a darker skin complexion (especially the females, mainly those who are part of the [[ganguro]] subculture) are considered blackfacers.

It is the wealth and prosperity characteristic of these demographic groups at these specific points in time that can lend us understanding to when, why, and how one culture can most fluidly assimilate into another. Ironically, both cultures adopted black cultural practices in the midst of a post-war boom. In the case of Japan, the 'Japanese Miracle' gave many middle-class families the financial padding necessary for such diverse consumerism.\n\nRebelling against the conformity and homogeneity of Japanese society, Japanese blackfacers took it a step further by uniquely adapting the physical look of black culture by literally tanning their faces to seem more 'black.' To Japanese hip-hop fans and to Japanese culture, the hip-hop phenomena severely influenced Japanese youth. Japanese hip hop is just an animation. It mimics only the style of American hip hop, not the meaning.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" />\n\nSome critics of Japanese hip hop believe that it simply follows a long line of black music that ultimately gained popularity through a different ethnic group mimicking the music. The \"Elvis Effect\" occurs \"when white participation in traditionally black avenues of cultural production produces feelings of unease.\" It occurs whenever a white person attempts a historically black art-form, is discovered to critical acclaim, and this is what leads to that art-form receiving widespread commercial acceptance. Aside from [[Elvis Presley]], notable examples throughout music history include [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Eric Clapton]], and [[Eminem]]. Many critics believe that this concept is relevant to Japanese and other forms of global hip hop. If listeners first discover Hip Hop through a Japanese artist, there is the fear that they will never bother learning about hip hop's origins and simply continue to listen to strictly Japanese versions of the genre.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Condry  | first = Ian  | title = Hip Hop Japan  | publisher = Duke University Press  | location = California  | year = 2007  | page = 33| isbn = 978-0-8223-3892-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author= Neal, Mark Anthony | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPMU%2FPMU24_03%2FS0261143005000577a.pdf&code=6bf3ea105f443e333a840b894cced959| title = White chocolate soul: Teena Marie and Lewis Taylor| accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Japanese hip hop dance scene==\nDancing is an important aspect of the hip-hop culture. Before hip-hop was popular in Japan, there was soul dancing, which provided a foundation for Japanese acceptance of street dance culture. A big break through time for the dance scene in Japan was after the movies \"Flashdance,\" \"[[Wild Style]]\", and \"[[Beat Street]]\". This was only the beginning of the dance explosion in Japan. The New York hip hop scene also had a large impact on the dance influence in Japan. [[Lalah Hathaway]]'s \"Baby Don't Cry\" music video had a large impact on dancers in Japan and started to mold the style into something closer to the NY sophisticated dance style.<ref>[http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/japan/history.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825140506/http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/japan/history.html |date=August 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThis attracted many Japanese people to NY to see this style of dancing for themselves. In addition in 1992 the form of street dancing known as \"house\" emerged from the influence of music videos as well. It took very well to the culture in Japan and is now well known. Wood discusses in his writing \"Yellow Negro\" the influence that race plays on the club scene and the type of dancing and music played in Japan depends on the racial composition of its guests.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> The club scene is a very important scene for the Japanese people to be able to express hip hop in a visual way that stretches across all barriers regardless of language.\n\n==Language==\nInitially language was a barrier for hip-hop in Japan. Rappers only rapped in English because it was believed that the differences between English and Japanese would make it impossible to rap in Japanese. Unlike English, the Japanese language ends phrases in [[auxiliary verb]]s. Whereas English ends in verbs or nouns, which are extremely common, Japanese rappers were limited by the small number of grammatically correct possibilities for ending a phrase. Japanese also lacks the stresses on certain syllables that provide flow to English rapping. Even traditional [[Japanese poetry]] was based on the numbers of syllables present, unlike [[English poetry]], which was based on the stresses in a line. Most Japanese lyrical music was also formulated using textual repetition, not relying on the flow of the words.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\">Manabe, Noriko. \"Globalization and Japanese Creativity: Adaptations of the Japanese Language to Rap\". ''Ethnomusicology''. vol. 50, no. 1 (Winter 2006):1\u201336.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese also have many ways of [[Keigo|indicating class distinctions]]. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving the bridge of the song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /> Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often [[homonym]]s were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/> Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" />\n\nRhymes were also added to Japanese hip-hop by altering the basic structure of the language by eliminating the final auxiliary verbs in raps and instead placing key words at the end of lines.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/> Additionally, to make Japanese work in a rhyming setting, the rappers change the language by using slang, derogatory terms, regional variations, gendered variations, and bilingual puns so that  \"more hip-hop\" means the creation of \"more Japanese.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\"/> Rappers are able to express themselves using mature lyrics and \"create\" new language that does not inhibit their rhyming. As such, Japanese hip-hop music is often praised for its mature and culturally relevant lyrics.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\"/>\n\nEnglish phrases were also put at the end of lines where a Japanese word could not be found to fit. This made rhyming in Japanese far easier, both in basic language and in regard to themes like the concept of social responsibility versus emotional needs.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s it was thought \"rap\" needed definition before [[rhyme]]. Rappers like mc Bell and Cake-K explain that rap is talking with rhythm and melody. Mc Bell argues that rap cannot exist without rhyme: \"you need words ending with the same sound...three rhymes in a measure is called three-link rhyming.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /> English is perceived as cool so that Japanese rappers usually add typical phrases such as 'check it out!', 'say ho!', 'awww shit!', and 'Goddamn!' According to Shuhei Hosokawa, those phrases are incidentally added and \"the phonetic quality of black verbal expression is sometimes adopted\" as well. He also notes that in Japanese Hip-Hop, the \"semantics matter, yet so do phonetics...meaningful wording\" is important, as is \"playful rhyming\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jyn006v1 |title=Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization |journal=Social Science Japan Journal |volume=11 |pages=159\u2013162 |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=2015-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505172518/http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jyn006v1 |archivedate=May 5, 2009 |df= |doi=10.1093/ssjj/jyn006 |last1=Hosokawa |first1=S. }}</ref>\n\n==Venues and events==\n[[Genba]], also known as the actual site, is the place and space for established and future underground hip-hop<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_hip_hop|title=underground hip hop|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}} artists to gain and maintain recognition.

In the city of Tokyo, between the youth shopping districts of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and Harajuku, there was created a ''genb''a \u2013 a fathering point for youthful fans and performers. Traffic was stopped, and people and artists were able to perform and express themselves outside in this very public arena. This area became known as \"Hokouten,\" short for ''hokousha tengoku'', which means \"pedestrian paradise.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\"/>\n\nThumpin' Camp was one of the most memorable and largest hip hop events that occurred in Japan. July 7, 1996 is an unforgettable day for many rappers, as well as the fans; about four thousand people attended the show. Males were more attracted to this hip hop scene than females; thus, about 80% of the audience was male adolescents. Over thirty rappers, DJs, and break-dancers from the underground scene performed in the show. This event touched many young individuals who were passionate about hip hop.

The clubs that only play hip hop and reggae are attended mostly by black people. In the clubs frequented by Japanese people and those that white people attend, there is an even proportion of race and gender. In these clubs, you will generally find equal numbers of Japanese men and women, and a fairly even proportion of racially different men and women. However, in the hip hop clubs, \"almost all the men are black, and almost all the women are Japanese\".<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> Often in the hip hop clubs, Japanese women darken their skin and wear [[hair extensions|extensions]] and [[cornrows]] to attain a \"natural\" black look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightcove.tv/title.jsp?title=769727990&channel=712914972 |accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nAs aforementioned, [[genba]] is agreeably one of the most prominent and core place for hip hop in Japan, there is however a visible shift and spread/increase of Japanese hip hop venues. Among these are clubs, crowds on streets and many more. According to [[Ian Condry]], in his book<ref>Condry Ian Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006.</ref> he outlines the idea and fact that, clubs have become one of the most convenient and top promoting places for Japanese hip hop. Great Djs and turntable-lists use clubs to as venues to not promote other rappers, by that spreading the hip-hop culture, bring and promote new songs and their own [[hip hop]] work. Referring to some sources such as,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/forum/quereadisplay.html?0+16859 |title=hip hop clubs - japan-guide.com forum |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> the above named source is a Japanese hip hop forum that also focuses on clubs in Japan.

Rhymester has put out motivating messages through hip hop, with songs like \"B-Boyism\" that emphasizes improving oneself, with lyrics such as \"I'm not surrendering this aesthetic flattering no one, I improve myself only the wonderful, useless people get it, and roar, at the edge of the bass.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Condry, Ian.

They are one of the few pioneers of Japanese hip-hop. They began their hip hop careers in 1993 and felt hip-hop was needed in Japan. Group members, Zeebra and K Dub Shine, both of whom had lived in the U.S., were convinced of the necessity for hip-hop to be about issues of social opposition.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" /> They used hip-hop to address social issues of the time, such as: the inability of college graduates to find employment and the media overload of advertising sex and violence. They also \"challenged youth not only to recognize the difficulties faced by Japanese society but also to speak up about them.\"<ref>Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006</ref> Their first album has been cited as being influential in the development of rapping style in Japanese.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/>\n\n[[Dabo]] is one of the first hip hop artists in Japan. He sprung to the scene in the 1990s and has fame all over Japan. He is the first Japanese artist to be signed to Def Jam Japan. He is also disliked for his style of hip hop, which is said to be imitation of African American Hip Hop. Many Japanese musicians feel that artists similar to Dabo are just mimicking what they see in American hip hop and is not unique in any sense.<ref>Condry, Ian (2007). ''Hip Hop Japan''. California: Duke University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother influential rap artist in Japan is female rapper, [[Hime (rapper)|Hime]]. In her music, she employs a strong message to empower women in Japanese culture. Many of her songs combat the common stereotype of women in Japanese culture. She calls herself \"the voice of the Japanese doll,\" in attempts to challenge and reinvent stereotypes that label women as quiet and obedient. Another common [[stereotype]] used to degrade women in Japan is the term [[yellow cab (stereotype)|yellow cab]], which is used to describe a woman who is sexually provocative or whorish. In her song, Yellow cab, Hime cleverly deconstructs the derogatory connotations of this term. By contextualizing yellow cab as defining a woman who is in the driver's seat, Hime transforms its meaning in attempts to empower Japanese women.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\nAnother influential artist in Japan is a male singer [[Toshinobu Kubota]]. Kubota is a Japanese singer who is originally from Shizuoka, Japan. Kubota is known as the pioneer of soul music in Japan. His music styles have varied over the years, from pop-oriented sounds through to reggae and soul. Kubota made his Japanese debut in 1986 with the album, Shake It Paradise. His popularity peaked with his award-winning 1990 release, \"Bonga Wanga.\" Kubota's albums have consistently sold over a million copies each in Japan.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/> According to a reading from the yellow negro, some Japanese artist have made reference to profound attraction to black music and style. They have embraced jazz, rock 'n' roll, funk, and other forms of African American expression.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|url=https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/wood-yellow-negro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080413161804/https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/wood-yellow-negro.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Hime has revolutionized the rhyming patterns in rap songs by embracing traditional Japanese poetic forms such as [[Tanka (poetry)|tanka]] in her song \"If the Peony Stands.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/foreign-languages-and-literatures/21f-067j-cultural-performances-of-asia-fall-2005/lecture-notes/l6_jhh_911_fin.pdf |title= Japanese Hip-Hop and Globalization |publisher= Ocw.mit.edu |accessdate= 2015-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140815172854/http%3A//ocw.mit.edu/courses/foreign%2Dlanguages%2Dand%2Dliteratures/21f%2D067j%2Dcultural%2Dperformances%2Dof%2Dasia%2Dfall%2D2005/lecture%2Dnotes/l6_jhh_911_fin.pdf |archivedate= 2014-08-15 |df=  }}</ref> In her use of this intricate form, she embraces and fuses Japanese culture with traditional American hip hop styling. Hip hop is also an outlet for Japanese minority groups such as [[Burakumin]] and [[Koreans in Japan]] to express their experiences. Jin Black is a rapper who writes about his life in a [[Burakumin]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nOne of the propelling factors of the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, [[Tommy Hilfiger]] jeans and baseball caps. This macho look is even found on the women.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> In Tokyo you are most likely to find the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop's growing presence can be most experienced.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\"/> Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the [[Bathing Ape]] line. Bape has been worn by [[Pharrell Williams]] and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available in many of these stores can be very expensive.

As a result, hip hop stands as one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan and the line between it and [[pop music]] is frequently blurred.\n\n==History of hip hop in Japan==\nAlthough rather informal and small scale, the early days of Japanese hip hop provide the history for the emergence of the [[cultural movement]]. Early hip hop was not led by corporate interests, but rather was largely ignored by large [[record companies]] and performance venues. In this respect, Japanese hip-hop offers a representation of [[cultural globalization]], as it expanded despite criticism on the part of record companies and major media outlets. The history shows that certain kinds of cultural exchange are not initiated through cultural understanding, but instead from some interaction that can incite a desire to learn, to participate, and to contribute individuality. In Japan, this motivation to represent individuality was [[breakdancing]], which was one of the leading edges of hip-hop at the time.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Condry, Ian (2007). Hip Hop Japan.

According to Takagi Kan, a first generation Japanese MC, \"I couldn't tell what was with the rap and the [[DJing]]...but with the breakdancing and [[graffiti art]], you could understand it visually. Or rather, it wasn't understanding so much as, 'Whoa, that's cool' ''[kakkoii]''. With rap and DJing, I couldn't imagine what could be cool about it.\" Dancing has a visual impact that everyone can understand, when it comes to dance there is not a language barrier. Break dancing represented the foundation for the spread of Japanese hip-hop and served as a medium for globalization.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/>\n\nAs in Germany, much of Japan was introduced to [[hip hop]] in the fall of 1983 with the movie ''[[Wild Style]]''.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/condry/www/jhh/ |title=Japanese Hip-Hop, by Ian Condry (MIT) |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> The film is \"the classic hip-hop flick, full of great subway shots, breakdancing, freestyle MCing and rare footage of one of the godfathers of hip-hop, [[Grandmaster Flash]], pulling off an awesome scratch-mix set on a pair of ancient turntables.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084904/plotsummary|title=Wild Style (1983) : Plot Summary|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> The popularity of the film led to many of the artists involved in it to make a trip to Japan to promote the film and they even performed in some of the department stores while they were there.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" />\n\nShortly after, Japanese took up breakdancing in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Yoyogi Park]], where street musicians gather every Sunday to perform.

Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, but with the increase in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as it would be hard to rap in Japanese.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" />\n\nStreet musicians began to breakdance in [[Yoyogi Park]], including [[DJ Krush]] who has become a world-renowned DJ after arising from the Yoyogi Park scene. In 1986 an all hip hop club opened in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. While interest in hip-hop in Japan grew some during the 1980s and early 1990s, the rap scene remained fairly small and rather marginalized.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\">Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006.</ref> One reason for the rap scene to remain so small and a little bit less popular compared to hip hop is because of the fact that the [[Japanese language]] does \"not contain stress accents and sentences must end with one of a few simple verb endings.\"<ref>Condry, Ian.

The first hit was [[Schadaraparr]]'s \"Kon'ya wa b\u016bgi bakku\" (Boogie Back Tonight) by Scha Dara Parr and [[Kenji Ozawa|Ozawa Kenji]], followed by East End X Yuri's \"Da. Yo.

Hip-hop style and Japanese rap has been an enormous commercial success in Japan. In a 2003 interview with the [[BBC]], Tokyo record-store owner, Hideaki Tamura noted \"Japanese hip-hop really exploded in the last two, three years.

For Japan, the style of hip hop was much more appealing than topics popular in American hip hop, such as violence.<ref name=\"autogenerated8\" /> Ian Condry, on the other hand, focuses on an interplay between local and global hip hop within the genba of Japan. For Condry, Japanese hip hop was born out of simultaneous localization and globalization of hip hop culture, rather than a shift between the two binary factors.<ref>Condry, Ian.

Shows like '[[Soul Train]]' spread the African style of on-going dance that would soon be picked up by varying cultures all over the world. It is this style of dance that laid the foundation for the globalization of African culture due to its universal criteria. Anyone can dance to soul music, which is not the case in terms of rapping, b-boying, etc. As movies like '[[Flashdance]]' (1983) reached the islands, more and more young people began dancing on the street and other public arenas, which added to its cultural integration. Soon, Japanese culture was ready to alter the very structure of their language in order to partake in hip hop.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n[[Image:YOKOBLING.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Japanese hip-hop fan sports an [[Afro]] and shows some Japanese style [[bling]]]]\nHip hop was thought to have originally become popular in Japan because the Japanese people wanted to imitate Africans. The Japanese would hear these rapper's music spinning in clubs, exposing to them a small, narrow view of West Coast hip hop. It was not only the music they latched onto, however. They came to love the entire hip hop culture, including the loose-fitting clothes, graffiti writing, and break dancing.

Pan derives from the American company [[Pan American World Airways]] and combines with the Japanese word ''pan'' meaning bread (thus these girls were also euphemistically known as bread girls) The more attractive girls often had to service \"white bread\" or white soldiers and were known as ''yagipan'' with ''yagi'' being the Japanese word for goat, a white hairy animal. Less attractive girls serviced \"black bread\" or black soldiers and were known as ''burapan'' with ''bura'' deriving from the Japanese word [[burakumin]] relating to [[social stigma]].<ref name=\"\u73fe\u4ee3\u7528\u8a9e\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Cite journal|last=Condry |first=Ian |title=Yellow B-Boys, Black Culture, and Hip-Hop in Japan: Toward a Transnational Cultural Politics of Race  |journal=Positions: East Asia Cultures Critique |volume=15 |pages=637\u2013671 |year=2007 |doi=10.1215/10679847-2007-008|issue=3|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/positions/v015/15.3condry.html}}</ref> Therefore, a ''burapan'' is literally \"a woman who prostitutes herself for black men.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nAlthough the word has come to describe a trend of dress and culture modeled after Africans, it is inherently problematic because of its origins.

Before hip hop, the Japanese had embraced jazz, rock n roll and funk. It is important to note however, despite the seemingly racist tendencies toward Africans and the simultaneous embrace of black culture, the Japanese have a very different construction of racial ideology then the US. Whereas the white versus black dichotomy typifies the racial system in the US, the Japanese construct their identities in terms of nationalism. Rather than identifying strongly with a color, Japanese tradition speaks to a homogeneous society that places foreigners in the \"other category.\"{{Dubious|date=May 2013}}  Because of this context, \"jiggers\" and the young teens who wear blackface rebel by embracing individual identities that are different from the norm.<ref name=\"autogenerated13\">Wood, Joe. \"The Yellow Negro.\" Transition 73: 40-67</ref>\n\n=== Blackface ===\nPeople who tan in order to get a darker skin complexion (especially the females, mainly those who are part of the [[ganguro]] subculture) are considered blackfacers.

It is the wealth and prosperity characteristic of these demographic groups at these specific points in time that can lend us understanding to when, why, and how one culture can most fluidly assimilate into another. Ironically, both cultures adopted black cultural practices in the midst of a post-war boom. In the case of Japan, the 'Japanese Miracle' gave many middle-class families the financial padding necessary for such diverse consumerism.\n\nRebelling against the conformity and homogeneity of Japanese society, Japanese blackfacers took it a step further by uniquely adapting the physical look of black culture by literally tanning their faces to seem more 'black.' To Japanese hip-hop fans and to Japanese culture, the hip-hop phenomena severely influenced Japanese youth. Japanese hip hop is just an animation. It mimics only the style of American hip hop, not the meaning.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" />\n\nSome critics of Japanese hip hop believe that it simply follows a long line of black music that ultimately gained popularity through a different ethnic group mimicking the music. The \"Elvis Effect\" occurs \"when white participation in traditionally black avenues of cultural production produces feelings of unease.\" It occurs whenever a white person attempts a historically black art-form, is discovered to critical acclaim, and this is what leads to that art-form receiving widespread commercial acceptance. Aside from [[Elvis Presley]], notable examples throughout music history include [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Eric Clapton]], and [[Eminem]]. Many critics believe that this concept is relevant to Japanese and other forms of global hip hop. If listeners first discover Hip Hop through a Japanese artist, there is the fear that they will never bother learning about hip hop's origins and simply continue to listen to strictly Japanese versions of the genre.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Condry  | first = Ian  | title = Hip Hop Japan  | publisher = Duke University Press  | location = California  | year = 2007  | page = 33| isbn = 978-0-8223-3892-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author= Neal, Mark Anthony | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPMU%2FPMU24_03%2FS0261143005000577a.pdf&code=6bf3ea105f443e333a840b894cced959| title = White chocolate soul: Teena Marie and Lewis Taylor| accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Japanese hip hop dance scene==\nDancing is an important aspect of the hip-hop culture. Before hip-hop was popular in Japan, there was soul dancing, which provided a foundation for Japanese acceptance of street dance culture. A big break through time for the dance scene in Japan was after the movies \"Flashdance,\" \"[[Wild Style]]\", and \"[[Beat Street]]\". This was only the beginning of the dance explosion in Japan. The New York hip hop scene also had a large impact on the dance influence in Japan. [[Lalah Hathaway]]'s \"Baby Don't Cry\" music video had a large impact on dancers in Japan and started to mold the style into something closer to the NY sophisticated dance style.<ref>[http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/japan/history.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825140506/http://www.msu.edu/~okumurak/japan/history.html |date=August 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThis attracted many Japanese people to NY to see this style of dancing for themselves. In addition in 1992 the form of street dancing known as \"house\" emerged from the influence of music videos as well. It took very well to the culture in Japan and is now well known. Wood discusses in his writing \"Yellow Negro\" the influence that race plays on the club scene and the type of dancing and music played in Japan depends on the racial composition of its guests.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> The club scene is a very important scene for the Japanese people to be able to express hip hop in a visual way that stretches across all barriers regardless of language.\n\n==Language==\nInitially language was a barrier for hip-hop in Japan. Rappers only rapped in English because it was believed that the differences between English and Japanese would make it impossible to rap in Japanese. Unlike English, the Japanese language ends phrases in [[auxiliary verb]]s. Whereas English ends in verbs or nouns, which are extremely common, Japanese rappers were limited by the small number of grammatically correct possibilities for ending a phrase. Japanese also lacks the stresses on certain syllables that provide flow to English rapping. Even traditional [[Japanese poetry]] was based on the numbers of syllables present, unlike [[English poetry]], which was based on the stresses in a line. Most Japanese lyrical music was also formulated using textual repetition, not relying on the flow of the words.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\">Manabe, Noriko. \"Globalization and Japanese Creativity: Adaptations of the Japanese Language to Rap\". ''Ethnomusicology''. vol. 50, no. 1 (Winter 2006):1\u201336.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese also have many ways of [[Keigo|indicating class distinctions]]. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving the bridge of the song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /> Slowly, with the increase in popularity of rap in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often [[homonym]]s were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/> Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" />\n\nRhymes were also added to Japanese hip-hop by altering the basic structure of the language by eliminating the final auxiliary verbs in raps and instead placing key words at the end of lines.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/> Additionally, to make Japanese work in a rhyming setting, the rappers change the language by using slang, derogatory terms, regional variations, gendered variations, and bilingual puns so that  \"more hip-hop\" means the creation of \"more Japanese.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\"/> Rappers are able to express themselves using mature lyrics and \"create\" new language that does not inhibit their rhyming. As such, Japanese hip-hop music is often praised for its mature and culturally relevant lyrics.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\"/>\n\nEnglish phrases were also put at the end of lines where a Japanese word could not be found to fit. This made rhyming in Japanese far easier, both in basic language and in regard to themes like the concept of social responsibility versus emotional needs.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s it was thought \"rap\" needed definition before [[rhyme]]. Rappers like mc Bell and Cake-K explain that rap is talking with rhythm and melody. Mc Bell argues that rap cannot exist without rhyme: \"you need words ending with the same sound...three rhymes in a measure is called three-link rhyming.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /> English is perceived as cool so that Japanese rappers usually add typical phrases such as 'check it out!', 'say ho!', 'awww shit!', and 'Goddamn!' According to Shuhei Hosokawa, those phrases are incidentally added and \"the phonetic quality of black verbal expression is sometimes adopted\" as well. He also notes that in Japanese Hip-Hop, the \"semantics matter, yet so do phonetics...meaningful wording\" is important, as is \"playful rhyming\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jyn006v1 |title=Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization |journal=Social Science Japan Journal |volume=11 |pages=159\u2013162 |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=2015-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505172518/http://ssjj.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jyn006v1 |archivedate=May 5, 2009 |df= |doi=10.1093/ssjj/jyn006 |last1=Hosokawa |first1=S. }}</ref>\n\n==Venues and events==\n[[Genba]], also known as the actual site, is the place and space for established and future underground hip-hop<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_hip_hop|title=underground hip hop|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}} artists to gain and maintain recognition. It is here in these venues and night clubs that the artist performs and networks with people from the music industry, the audience, and the media. If the artist is a crowd favorite, the audience cheers or dances and this in a way decides the fate.<ref>Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006. of the artist.</ref>\n\nWithout such ''genba'' acknowledgments, artists would disappear from the scene. Conversely, the business success of some rappers is not rejected but seen with a touch of envy, especially if they manage to go frequently to nightclubs like [[Zeebra]] to sustain their networks and keep up to date on the latest trends.<ref>Social Science Japan Journal Advance, March 5, 2008</ref>\n\nBefore the turn of the new millennium, ''genba'' served as a places where Japanese hip hop colture was created and born. In the city of Tokyo, between the youth shopping districts of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] and Harajuku, there was created a ''genb''a \u2013 a fathering point for youthful fans and performers. Traffic was stopped, and people and artists were able to perform and express themselves outside in this very public arena. This area became known as \"Hokouten,\" short for ''hokousha tengoku'', which means \"pedestrian paradise.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated10\"/>\n\nThumpin' Camp was one of the most memorable and largest hip hop events that occurred in Japan. July 7, 1996 is an unforgettable day for many rappers, as well as the fans; about four thousand people attended the show. Males were more attracted to this hip hop scene than females; thus, about 80% of the audience was male adolescents. Over thirty rappers, DJs, and break-dancers from the underground scene performed in the show. This event touched many young individuals who were passionate about hip hop. The Thumpin\u2019Camp show left a remarkable memory in the hip hop history in Japan.<ref name=\"autogenerated10\" /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CH8Nj_bBxWoC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=the+Thumpin'+Camp+show+in+japan#PPA131,M1 |title=Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization |date= November 2006|accessdate=2015-06-17|isbn=978-0822338925 |last1=Condry |first1=Ian }}</ref>\n\nJapan boasts a variety of clubs, which, although they are \"open to all races...the kind of music played depends on the race of the next largest racial group.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> That group, being next largest to the Japanese, who can be found at each of the different clubs. The clubs that only play hip hop and reggae are attended mostly by black people. In the clubs frequented by Japanese people and those that white people attend, there is an even proportion of race and gender. In these clubs, you will generally find equal numbers of Japanese men and women, and a fairly even proportion of racially different men and women. However, in the hip hop clubs, \"almost all the men are black, and almost all the women are Japanese\".<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> Often in the hip hop clubs, Japanese women darken their skin and wear [[hair extensions|extensions]] and [[cornrows]] to attain a \"natural\" black look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightcove.tv/title.jsp?title=769727990&channel=712914972 |accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nAs aforementioned, [[genba]] is agreeably one of the most prominent and core place for hip hop in Japan, there is however a visible shift and spread/increase of Japanese hip hop venues. Among these are clubs, crowds on streets and many more. According to [[Ian Condry]], in his book<ref>Condry Ian Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006.</ref> he outlines the idea and fact that, clubs have become one of the most convenient and top promoting places for Japanese hip hop. Great Djs and turntable-lists use clubs to as venues to not promote other rappers, by that spreading the hip-hop culture, bring and promote new songs and their own [[hip hop]] work. Referring to some sources such as,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/forum/quereadisplay.html?0+16859 |title=hip hop clubs - japan-guide.com forum |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref> the above named source is a Japanese hip hop forum that also focuses on clubs in Japan. The above source also services proof of Dj and upcoming artists naming places, clubs, Street gatherings of where they are going to be so as to promote their work or any artist they are interested in. The above all in all justifies the view that Japanese Hip hop venues are not just genba but have rather taken and shift or taking a shift into a variety of places such as the ones named above.\n\n==Notable Japanese artists==\nOne major Japanese hip hop group, [[Rhymester (group)|Rhymester]], has expressed opinions on various global and philosophical issues through their lyrics. Rhymester has put out motivating messages through hip hop, with songs like \"B-Boyism\" that emphasizes improving oneself, with lyrics such as \"I'm not surrendering this aesthetic flattering no one, I improve myself only the wonderful, useless people get it, and roar, at the edge of the bass.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">Condry, Ian. Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006</ref>  The group has also written socially critical lyrics, in songs attacking the Japanese government, as well as the United States for invading Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|author=Condry, Ian|title=Hip-Hop, Asia, and Global Culture: Anti-War Japanese Rap and Young People?|url=http://asia.kyushu-u.ac.jp/home/ajiarikai/kiroku/18/1/gaiyou1.pdf|accessdate=2015-06-17}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Rhymester is also known for its collaborative work with the Funky Grammar Unit in the 1980s, as well as its participation in hip hop battles.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\nAnother major group of Japanese hip-hop is [[King Giddra]]. They are one of the few pioneers of Japanese hip-hop. They began their hip hop careers in 1993 and felt hip-hop was needed in Japan. Group members, Zeebra and K Dub Shine, both of whom had lived in the U.S., were convinced of the necessity for hip-hop to be about issues of social opposition.<ref name=\"autogenerated15\" /> They used hip-hop to address social issues of the time, such as: the inability of college graduates to find employment and the media overload of advertising sex and violence. They also \"challenged youth not only to recognize the difficulties faced by Japanese society but also to speak up about them.\"<ref>Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006</ref> Their first album has been cited as being influential in the development of rapping style in Japanese.<ref name=\"autogenerated14\"/>\n\n[[Dabo]] is one of the first hip hop artists in Japan. He sprung to the scene in the 1990s and has fame all over Japan. He is the first Japanese artist to be signed to Def Jam Japan. He is also disliked for his style of hip hop, which is said to be imitation of African American Hip Hop. Many Japanese musicians feel that artists similar to Dabo are just mimicking what they see in American hip hop and is not unique in any sense.<ref>Condry, Ian (2007). ''Hip Hop Japan''. California: Duke University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother influential rap artist in Japan is female rapper, [[Hime (rapper)|Hime]]. In her music, she employs a strong message to empower women in Japanese culture. Many of her songs combat the common stereotype of women in Japanese culture. She calls herself \"the voice of the Japanese doll,\" in attempts to challenge and reinvent stereotypes that label women as quiet and obedient. Another common [[stereotype]] used to degrade women in Japan is the term [[yellow cab (stereotype)|yellow cab]], which is used to describe a woman who is sexually provocative or whorish. In her song, Yellow cab, Hime cleverly deconstructs the derogatory connotations of this term. By contextualizing yellow cab as defining a woman who is in the driver's seat, Hime transforms its meaning in attempts to empower Japanese women.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" />\n\nAnother influential artist in Japan is a male singer [[Toshinobu Kubota]]. Kubota is a Japanese singer who is originally from Shizuoka, Japan. Kubota is known as the pioneer of soul music in Japan. His music styles have varied over the years, from pop-oriented sounds through to reggae and soul. Kubota made his Japanese debut in 1986 with the album, Shake It Paradise. His popularity peaked with his award-winning 1990 release, \"Bonga Wanga.\" Kubota's albums have consistently sold over a million copies each in Japan.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/> According to a reading from the yellow negro, some Japanese artist have made reference to profound attraction to black music and style. They have embraced jazz, rock 'n' roll, funk, and other forms of African American expression.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|url=https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/wood-yellow-negro.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080413161804/https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/wood-yellow-negro.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Hime has revolutionized the rhyming patterns in rap songs by embracing traditional Japanese poetic forms such as [[Tanka (poetry)|tanka]] in her song \"If the Peony Stands.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/foreign-languages-and-literatures/21f-067j-cultural-performances-of-asia-fall-2005/lecture-notes/l6_jhh_911_fin.pdf |title= Japanese Hip-Hop and Globalization |publisher= Ocw.mit.edu |accessdate= 2015-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140815172854/http%3A//ocw.mit.edu/courses/foreign%2Dlanguages%2Dand%2Dliteratures/21f%2D067j%2Dcultural%2Dperformances%2Dof%2Dasia%2Dfall%2D2005/lecture%2Dnotes/l6_jhh_911_fin.pdf |archivedate= 2014-08-15 |df=  }}</ref> In her use of this intricate form, she embraces and fuses Japanese culture with traditional American hip hop styling. Hip hop is also an outlet for Japanese minority groups such as [[Burakumin]] and [[Koreans in Japan]] to express their experiences. Jin Black is a rapper who writes about his life in a [[Burakumin]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nOne of the propelling factors of the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, [[Tommy Hilfiger]] jeans and baseball caps. This macho look is even found on the women.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> In Tokyo you are most likely to find the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop's growing presence can be most experienced.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\"/> Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the [[Bathing Ape]] line. Bape has been worn by [[Pharrell Williams]] and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available in many of these stores can be very expensive. Hip hop fashion is now also popular in the suburbs - although some people are only following [[Fashion|fashion trends]] and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop's presence can definitely be seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.<ref>[http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/492/feature.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814202147/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/492/feature.asp |date=August 14, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Japanese influence on current hip-hop==\nJapanese Denim is very popular amongst modern hip-hop culture. From Evisu to Red Monkey which are notable by many American hip-hop artists, show the spread of Japanese culture in to hip-hop.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/03/japans-influences-on-hip-hop/2/ |title=Japan's Influences on Hip-Hop - Page 2 of 9 - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2015-06-17}}</ref>\n\nJapanese art has been an influence on hip hop culture as well. Takashi Murakami paints Japanese cultural objects and icons repetitiously and markets them on all sorts of products including keychains, mouse pads, T-shirts and Louis Vuitton handbags. He is responsible for [[Kanye West]]'s [[Graduation (album)|Graduation]] and [[Kids See Ghosts]] album covers.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of Japanese hip hop musicians]]\n*[[Anime in hip hop]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://web.mit.edu/condry/www/jhh/ Ian Condry's site, with videos and historical background] (out of date)\n*[http://www.macsem.org/PantaleoniPrizePaper2005.pdf Japanese rap and language, conference version]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080719234844/http://japan4music.com/ Japan4Music \u2013 Musicians in Japan]\n*[http://jrapmusic.wordpress.com/ JRapMusic \u2013 All about Japanese Hip Hop]\n*[http://jrapmusic.wordpress.com/jrap-culture/ J-Rap Culture] - Hip Hop culture in Japan\n*[http://jasgp.org/content/view/677/179/ Jero: Japan's First African-American Enka Singer] - Enka with Hip Hop aesthetics - Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia\n\n{{hiphop}}\n{{Music of Japan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Japanese Hip Hop}}\n[[Category:Japanese hip hop| ]]\n[[Category:Ethnic issues in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_hip_hop"}
