This is a collection of works regularly publishing articles by research scientists contributing to the emergence of \u201cThe new French school of thinking with respect to trace\u201d[1] (https://www.cnr seditions.fr/auteur/beatrice-galinon-melenec/)\n\n   \n== Research work ==\n\n=== Deconstruction of the term \"Trace\" ===\nB\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec denounces the simplification of the use of the notion of trace which, contrary to appearances, needs to be analysed in all its complexity. In her publications, she unveils the processes at work in human interpretation of the trace and, in line with the works of Jacques Derrida<ref>Derrida, Jacques., De la grammatologie, Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit, 1 janvier 1967 ({{ISBN|978-2-7073-0012-6}}, OCLC 906392252 (https://worldcat.org/oclc/906392252&lang=fr), lire en ligne (https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/906392252)) </ref>, encourages scientists who are concerned with epistemology to proceed with a systematic ''d\u00e9construction'' of the term.\n\n=== Sign-Trace. Semiotic embodied. Anthropo-semiotic. Relational semiotic ===\nWith the observation that everything that is potentially visible cannot necessarily be seen, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec starts from the hypothesis that signs only appear to individuals who are predisposed to receive them; this depends on their \"body-traces\"<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), quatri\u00e8me de couverture  </ref>, i.e. a body in which is recorded every consequence of the individual\u2019s interactions with the environments he/she has passed through over time. For the author, a human being\u2019s body-trace, (there is no separation between the body and the mind) possesses a plasticity which is the result of the interactions with the surroundings in which he/she lives (nature, culture, techniques, society, etc.). \n\nThe interactions of a body with its surroundings being specific to each individual, the resulting body-trace is recorded in a difference, which modulates the reception of what is perceptible. To signify that the perception and interpretation of the sign are the consequences, the author suggests the term \"sign-trace\"<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), p. 10 </ref>.\n \nThis definition has been used by researchers and professionals to analyse situations of interpersonal communication where the body is present. In this context, the interpretation of sign emitted by bodies appears as if recorded in a systemic dynamic linking the body-trace of the interpreted and the body-trace of the interpetant within a complex where bodies in co-presence are moved by permanent interactions of traces<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), quatri\u00e8me de couverture </ref>. \n\nThis approach finds its applications in various domains \u2013 internal business communication, recruitment<ref>Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, B\u00e9atrice, ed. (2011). L'Homme Trace - Perspectives Anthropologiques des Traces Contemporaines (in French). CNRS Editions. {{ISBN|978-2271-07139-2}}.</ref>, doctor-patient relationships \u2013 and puts into perspective the biaises introduced by remote communication.\n \n=== Ichnos-Anthropos (Human-Trace) ===\nThe human being is a \"human trace\" (Ichnos-Anthropos) whose body traces carry the \u201cconsequence-trace\u201d interactions of inside-outside dualism. According to the author, body-trace and environment-trace have been retroacting in a systemic dynamic since the beginning of humanity, which explains the co-evolution of species and the environment<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), quatri\u00e8me de couverture </ref>. \n\nThe interpretation that the Ichnos-Anthropos makes of the real comes from anthropo-semiotics, where signs appear as the result of an interaction between the body-trace of Ichnos-Anthropos and the reality-trace of the world. With the anthropological Human-Trace paradigm, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec sets the figurative stage of homo (sapiens or otherwise) from any era whose body carries traces (ichnos) of the past (his or those of humans who have preceded him) and whose present relationship with the world participates permanently in the production of a future integrating the \"consequence-traces\" of his present actions. As they were spread and appropriated by others, the term \"Human-Trace\" lost the paradigmatic dimension initially sought by the author. The effect of this being a preference for the Greek translation of \"Ichnos-Anthropos\" for the instances when referring to it in the strict sense of the paradigm.\n\n=== Influence ===\n\nThere has been a growing interest in the terms \"human trace\", \"body-trace\" and \"sign-trace\". Nevertheless, if reference is made to certain indexing tools [[Google Scholar]], the citations lead us to conclude that their uses in French articles in the humanities between 2008-2018 are more often linked to the evocative power of the words that form them than the systemic, dynamic and multi-scale perspective that they encompass for their author. \n\nThe traces of digital consultations of the works and publications reveal a 60% readership belonging to academia and from various geographical horizons <ref> Academia.edu </ref> (The United States, Canada, Brazil, The United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, India, The Philippines, Turkey, Mauritius, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Niger, Swiss).\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of the consequence-traces of human confinement on the decrease in [[pollution]], extends the author\u2019s influence which had repeatedly warned about the pragmatic interest of the [[ecosystem]] present in the Human-Trace paradigm. The modelling of the semiotic emergence of the  \"sign-trace\" via the \"body-trace\" \u2013 which highlights the specific relationship between a human-trace in constant evolution and a reality-trace constantly evolutionary \u2013 acts as a support to psychological, sociological, cognitive and ecological analysis of the observations<ref>Pequinot Julien, \u00ab Entretien avec B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec \u00bb, Communiquer, \"revue de communication sociale et publique\",\u200b 2020, pp. 91-115 (ISSN 2368-9587 (http://worldcat.org/issn/2368-9587&lang=fr)) </ref>.\n\n== Main publications ==\n\n=== In French ===\n* ''L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace,'' Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p.

In her publications, she unveils the processes at work in human interpretation of the trace and, in line with the works of Jacques Derrida<ref>Derrida, Jacques., De la grammatologie, Les \u00c9ditions de Minuit, 1 janvier 1967 ({{ISBN|978-2-7073-0012-6}}, OCLC 906392252 (https://worldcat.org/oclc/906392252&lang=fr), lire en ligne (https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/906392252)) </ref>, encourages scientists who are concerned with epistemology to proceed with a systematic ''d\u00e9construction'' of the term.\n\n=== Sign-Trace. Semiotic embodied. Anthropo-semiotic. Relational semiotic ===\nWith the observation that everything that is potentially visible cannot necessarily be seen, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec starts from the hypothesis that signs only appear to individuals who are predisposed to receive them; this depends on their \"body-traces\"<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), quatri\u00e8me de couverture  </ref>, i.e. a body in which is recorded every consequence of the individual\u2019s interactions with the environments he/she has passed through over time. For the author, a human being\u2019s body-trace, (there is no separation between the body and the mind) possesses a plasticity which is the result of the interactions with the surroundings in which he/she lives (nature, culture, techniques, society, etc.). \n\nThe interactions of a body with its surroundings being specific to each individual, the resulting body-trace is recorded in a difference, which modulates the reception of what is perceptible. To signify that the perception and interpretation of the sign are the consequences, the author suggests the term \"sign-trace\"<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), p. 10 </ref>.\n \nThis definition has been used by researchers and professionals to analyse situations of interpersonal communication where the body is present. In this context, the interpretation of sign emitted by bodies appears as if recorded in a systemic dynamic linking the body-trace of the interpreted and the body-trace of the interpetant within a complex where bodies in co-presence are moved by permanent interactions of traces<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), quatri\u00e8me de couverture </ref>. \n\nThis approach finds its applications in various domains \u2013 internal business communication, recruitment<ref>Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, B\u00e9atrice, ed. (2011). L'Homme Trace - Perspectives Anthropologiques des Traces Contemporaines (in French).

According to the author, body-trace and environment-trace have been retroacting in a systemic dynamic since the beginning of humanity, which explains the co-evolution of species and the environment<ref>B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec, L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p. ({{ISBN|978-2-271-11417-4}}), quatri\u00e8me de couverture </ref>. \n\nThe interpretation that the Ichnos-Anthropos makes of the real comes from anthropo-semiotics, where signs appear as the result of an interaction between the body-trace of Ichnos-Anthropos and the reality-trace of the world. With the anthropological Human-Trace paradigm, B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec sets the figurative stage of homo (sapiens or otherwise) from any era whose body carries traces (ichnos) of the past (his or those of humans who have preceded him) and whose present relationship with the world participates permanently in the production of a future integrating the \"consequence-traces\" of his present actions. As they were spread and appropriated by others, the term \"Human-Trace\" lost the paradigmatic dimension initially sought by the author. The effect of this being a preference for the Greek translation of \"Ichnos-Anthropos\" for the instances when referring to it in the strict sense of the paradigm.\n\n=== Influence ===\n\nThere has been a growing interest in the terms \"human trace\", \"body-trace\" and \"sign-trace\". Nevertheless, if reference is made to certain indexing tools [[Google Scholar]], the citations lead us to conclude that their uses in French articles in the humanities between 2008-2018 are more often linked to the evocative power of the words that form them than the systemic, dynamic and multi-scale perspective that they encompass for their author. \n\nThe traces of digital consultations of the works and publications reveal a 60% readership belonging to academia and from various geographical horizons <ref> Academia.edu </ref> (The United States, Canada, Brazil, The United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, India, The Philippines, Turkey, Mauritius, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Niger, Swiss).\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of the consequence-traces of human confinement on the decrease in [[pollution]], extends the author\u2019s influence which had repeatedly warned about the pragmatic interest of the [[ecosystem]] present in the Human-Trace paradigm. The modelling of the semiotic emergence of the  \"sign-trace\" via the \"body-trace\" \u2013 which highlights the specific relationship between a human-trace in constant evolution and a reality-trace constantly evolutionary \u2013 acts as a support to psychological, sociological, cognitive and ecological analysis of the observations<ref>Pequinot Julien, \u00ab Entretien avec B\u00e9atrice Galinon-M\u00e9l\u00e9nec \u00bb, Communiquer, \"revue de communication sociale et publique\",\u200b 2020, pp. 91-115 (ISSN 2368-9587 (http://worldcat.org/issn/2368-9587&lang=fr)) </ref>.\n\n== Main publications ==\n\n=== In French ===\n* L'Homme-Trace : Des traces du corps au corps-trace, Paris, CNRS Editions, 2017, 415 p.

It had a [[semi-monocoque]] fuselage, skinned with two layers of long [[plywood]] strips glued at opposing diagonal angles around a mold and skinned with fabric both inside and outside. The fuselage filled the full gap between the wings, leaving the pilot and observer/gunner over the top wings with an excellent view upward. The fuselage \"half-shells\" were each fitted onto a supporting framework of wooden [[former]]s and [[longeron]]s.

A version with the 200&nbsp;hp [[Benz Bz.IV]] engine and new wing struts was built as the D.III, but only one prototype was ever built, as was the case for the 160&nbsp;hp [[Mercedes D.III]]-powered C.V.\n\nThe C.II was adapted to the pure [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] role as the [[Roland D.I]], but in this role the poor forward view proved to be a problem.

A newer version with a more conventional layout, the [[LFG Roland D.II|Roland D.II]], followed, whose fuselage was reduced in height to leave a gap with the upper wing but was otherwise similar overall. The competing [[Albatros D.I]] was preferred, and only about 230 examples were built, which were then mostly used on the eastern front and in Macedonia. The fuselage to wing gap was further increased in the D.III, but the temperamental  180&nbsp;hp [[Argus As.III]] limited production to only a handful.

Before he became king in 1000, he was the Grand Prince of the [[Principality of Hungary]] and was living there with his Bavarian wife Gisella. The frequent opinion that the double cross was a cross that the [[Pope]] granted to Stephen I. around 1000 is still disputed. The opinion arose only in the 15th century based on a legend from the 12th century, which in addition only says that Stephen received an apostolic cross (i.e. a normal, not a double cross).<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nThe direct predecessor of the current coat of arms of Slovakia can be found in the coat of arms used by [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary|B\u00e9la]], the prince of the [[Duchy (Kingdom of Hungary)|Hungarian Duchy]] (1046\u20131060) and later [[King of Hungary]]. B\u00e9la was a member of the house of [[\u00c1rp\u00e1ds]] and was named after the [[Adalbert of Prague|Prague bishop Adalbert]], who had baptized King Stephen, the cousin of B\u00e9la's father, some decades ago. B\u00e9la conducted his own internal and international policy in his Nitrian frontier principality.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/> The Byzantine emperor, involved in a quarrel with the Hungarian king, even sent B\u00e9la a prince's crown to Nitra. Furthermore, B\u00e9la had own coins minted in 1050 in Nitra, the capital of his principality \u2013 coins which deliberately differed from those of the Hungarian king and which bore the double cross symbol.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nThe appearance of the double cross in coins before [[B\u00e9la III]] is highly disputed. According to recent view It is a simple misinterpretation of two normal crosses.<ref>Koln\u00edk: Byzantsk\u00e9 korene ikonografie a symboliky \u0161t\u00e1tneho znaku Slovenskej republiky Historick\u00fd Zborn\u00edk, 1999. 9. 13\u201332. p.</ref>\n\nIt was only 100 years later, around 1189, that the double cross is known to have been used again \u2013 it was used during a crusade of the Hungarian king [[B\u00e9la III]] as his royal symbol. The three hills seen in the modern Slovak and Hungarian coats of arms were still not present in the standard. This time, the symbol was already used as a [[coat of arms]], because coats of arms became fashionable in Europe at that time. He chose the symbol, because it was a [[Christianity|Christian]] symbol and because it was the oldest symbol used in his kingdom.\n\nB\u00e9la's successors [[Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]] and [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]], however, did not use anymore the double cross, which was associated with the Nitrian frontier principality situated in the northern part of the kingdom and dissolved in 1107, as their symbol, but they used a red-and-white-stripes symbol associated with the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes|House of \u00c1rp\u00e1ds]] (see the [[coat of arms of Hungary]] for a picture).\nKing [[B\u00e9la IV]] used the patriarchal cross again  \u2013 the reasons for this decision are unknown. Some historians suggest that he simply copied B\u00e9la III, his ideal, though this is only an assumption. At the time of his rule, the patriarchal cross also became the symbol of the [[Pozsony County|Pozsony (Pre\u0161porok, Bratislava or Pressburg) county]], although in a slightly modified form.\n\nThe last [[\u00c1rp\u00e1ds|\u00c1rp\u00e1d]] king, [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]] (1290\u20131301), used only the patriarchal cross.\n\nDuring the throne struggles after 1301, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Ladislaus]] used the double cross as his symbol (see chapter \"Three hills\" for details), while [[Charles Robert of Anjou]] (1307\u20131342) used a bipartite coat of arms consisting of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] symbol and the above-mentioned stripes symbol of [[Stephen V of Hungary|King Stephen V]], whose daughter Maria Charles Robert had married.\n\nAfter the [[Mongol invasion]] in 1241-1242 many of the newly founded towns in the Kingdom of Hungary received the right to use the royal double cross as their coat of arms. The first, biggest and most towns of the kingdom arose in present-day Slovakia{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} - the part of the kingdom that was characterized by German settlers, extensive mining activities and thus the most advanced economy at that time. It was probably partly due to this use in municipal coats of arm that the double cross became a clear symbol of the northern part of the kingdom again from the 15th century onwards and [[Upper Hungary]] from the 18th century.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nFrom the late 14th century onwards (according to other sources from the 13th century), the double cross symbol was used both as a symbol for northern parts of the Kingdom (\"partes Danubii septentrionales, partes regni superiores\", i.e. approximately the territory of present-day Slovakia and northeastern Hungary) and as a symbol of kings of the Kingdom of Hungary. For example, the state symbol of [[Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382) was a quartered coat of arms containing among other symbols the symbol of Charles Robert of Anjou (containing in turn the stripes symbol)  as the symbol for the southern parts of the kingdom (\"partes regni inferiores\") and the symbol for northern parts of the Kingdom (the double cross symbol). A good example of the double meaning of the double cross symbol is the great seal of King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437): This seal contains the double cross symbol in the middle, surrounded by a circle of smaller coats of arms of territories under his rule. These smaller coats of arms include the double cross symbol (for a second time!) as the symbol of what is today Slovakia and the stripes symbol as the symbol for Pannonia.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nSince 1526, when the Habsburgs became kings of the Kingdom of Hungary, the current \"combined\" coat of arms of Hungary including the double cross symbol and the stripes symbol was used as the symbol of the Kingdom of Hungary (except that the small crown below the double cross was added only in the 17th century).\n\n== Three hills ==\nThe [[Trimount|triple peak]] represents the three mountain ranges [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]], [[M\u00e1tra|Matra]] and [[Fatra (disambiguation)|Fatra]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->  which symbolized the northern mountainous part of the Kingdom of Hungary. (The Tatra and the Fatra ranges are in present day Slovakia.) This interpretation is probably the oldest and most frequent one \u2013 it can be traced back to the 16th century, but stems probably from the 15th century. According to [[Istv\u00e1n Werb\u0151czy]]'s \"Tripartitum\" from 16th century, the heaps represent the mountains in this order.\n\nThe three mountains below the double cross were used by King [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Ladislaus]] (1301\u20131305), who was crowned king of Hungary, but was a [[Czechs|Czech]] from the house of the [[P\u0159emyslids]].\n\n== Symbol of the Slovaks==\n\n=== Origins and colors===\n[[File:Slovensk\u00e1_vlajka_1848_z.png|thumb|right|150px|This flag from [[Slovak Uprising 1848-1849|Slovak Uprising 1848]] was one of the first depictions of Slovak coat of arms with three hills in blue colour.

A \"[[Slovak National Council (1848\u20131849)|Slovak National Council]]\" was established for this purpose in August 1848 in Vienna. The present-day coat of arms was used on the seal of this Slovak National Council for the first time officially as the national symbol of the Slovaks (instead of being the official symbol of Upper Hungary only). From that time onwards, the symbol has been used very frequently.\n\nAs for the colors, the colors are supposed to be the three \"Slavic\" colors red-white-blue ([[Slavic tricolor]]). Since the Upper Hungary coat of arms was already part of the [[coat of arms of Hungary|coat of arms of the Kingdom of Hungary]] at that time, only the  color of the three mountains had to be changed (it happened on the [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovak flag]] for the first time) from green to \"blue\" to receive the red-white-blue combination.\n\nAs for the origin of the red color (in the Slovak and in the Hungarian coat of arms), the coat of arms has often had the red color as an almost inseparable attendant of the double cross in the coats of many Hungarian and Slovak towns since the Middle Ages. Also, the coat of arms of B\u00e9la III. is thought to have had red background. In general, red background color was used frequently for coats of arms in the late 12th and early 13th century in central Europe. One of the modern interpretations of the color is that it represents the bloody lining and symbolizes the Slovak 'martyrdom' during the time of [[Magyarisation]] (19th century).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe color of the three mountains was originally green but in 1848 the Slovak National Council used it as blue in accordance with the [[Slavic tricolor]].\n\n=== 20th century===\nIn 1918, [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] troops began occupying northern Hungary in accordance with the territorial promises that the [[Triple Entente]] made to Czechoslovak politicians during World War I. However, Slovakia ([[Upper Hungary]]) was occupied by Hungarian troops from the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], who set up the [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] as a puppet regime. Its emblem was the [[red star]], a symbol of communism. Following a brief [[Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak War|war between Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania]], Slovakia was incorporated into Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1920 the Slovak coat of arms became part of the [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|state coat of arms]] of [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nBetween 1939 and 1945, it was the state symbol of the [[First Slovak Republic]].\n\nIn 1945, it became part of Czechoslovakia's coat of arms again. From 1960 to 1990 the symbol was officially forbidden, because it was interpreted by the Communists as the symbol of the fascist [[Slovak State]]. The old coat of arms was replaced in the Czechoslovak coat of arms by an artificial symbol consisting of Mt. [[Kriv\u00e1\u0148 (peak)|Kriv\u00e1\u0148]] and three flames. The three flames were supposed to symbolize the [[Slovak National Uprising]] of 1944.\n\nOn 1 March 1990, after the [[Velvet Revolution]], the old coat of arms became the official symbol of the \"Slovak Republic\", which was still part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Based on the [[Constitution of the Slovak Republic]] of September 3, 1992, the same coat of arms became the symbol of independent [[Slovakia]], which arose on January 1, 1993. A law of February 18, 1993, precised the details of the coat of arms: for example, though not explicitly defined in the coat's [[blazon]] in the past, during the World War II era the cross mostly used to be depicted with convex endings of the stake and the bars; therefore the new description clearly reads to depict them as concave.\n\nThe coat of arms is used by the [[Slovak Air Force]] as its [[roundel]].\n\nSince 1992 the coat of arms is also placed on the [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovak flag]].\n\n=== Part of other symbols===\n[[File:Flag of the President of Slovakia.svg|thumb|right|150px|Flag of the President of Slovakia]]\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Slovakia coat of arms big.svg|thumb|left|upright|Unofficial design for a greater coat of arms of Slovakia]] -->\nIn the 13th century King [[B\u00e9la III]] declared{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} the double cross (ex post) a symbol of Saint Ladislaus (King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]]). In 1386, it became part of the coat of arms of the house of [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiello]], because [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Jogaila]] took over the alleged coat of arms of Saint Ladislaus when being baptized as Ladislaus (Wladyslaw). By means of the Jagiellons, the symbol also got into the [[coat of arms of Lithuania]].\n\nThe [[President of Slovakia]] uses a banner of these arms.\n\nSlovak graphic designer Branislav Novotka<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/> designed a greater coat of arms of Slovakia and registered it at the [[Slovak Chamber of Genealogy and Heraldry]].

Furthermore, B\u00e9la had own coins minted in 1050 in Nitra, the capital of his principality \u2013 coins which deliberately differed from those of the Hungarian king and which bore the double cross symbol.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nThe appearance of the double cross in coins before [[B\u00e9la III]] is highly disputed. According to recent view It is a simple misinterpretation of two normal crosses.<ref>Koln\u00edk: Byzantsk\u00e9 korene ikonografie a symboliky \u0161t\u00e1tneho znaku Slovenskej republiky Historick\u00fd Zborn\u00edk, 1999. 9. 13\u201332. p.</ref>\n\nIt was only 100 years later, around 1189, that the double cross is known to have been used again \u2013 it was used during a crusade of the Hungarian king [[B\u00e9la III]] as his royal symbol. The three hills seen in the modern Slovak and Hungarian coats of arms were still not present in the standard. This time, the symbol was already used as a [[coat of arms]], because coats of arms became fashionable in Europe at that time. He chose the symbol, because it was a [[Christianity|Christian]] symbol and because it was the oldest symbol used in his kingdom.\n\nB\u00e9la's successors [[Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]] and [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]], however, did not use anymore the double cross, which was associated with the Nitrian frontier principality situated in the northern part of the kingdom and dissolved in 1107, as their symbol, but they used a red-and-white-stripes symbol associated with the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d stripes|House of \u00c1rp\u00e1ds]] (see the [[coat of arms of Hungary]] for a picture).\nKing [[B\u00e9la IV]] used the patriarchal cross again  \u2013 the reasons for this decision are unknown. Some historians suggest that he simply copied B\u00e9la III, his ideal, though this is only an assumption. At the time of his rule, the patriarchal cross also became the symbol of the [[Pozsony County|Pozsony (Pre\u0161porok, Bratislava or Pressburg) county]], although in a slightly modified form.\n\nThe last [[\u00c1rp\u00e1ds|\u00c1rp\u00e1d]] king, [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]] (1290\u20131301), used only the patriarchal cross.\n\nDuring the throne struggles after 1301, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Ladislaus]] used the double cross as his symbol (see chapter \"Three hills\" for details), while [[Charles Robert of Anjou]] (1307\u20131342) used a bipartite coat of arms consisting of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] symbol and the above-mentioned stripes symbol of [[Stephen V of Hungary|King Stephen V]], whose daughter Maria Charles Robert had married.\n\nAfter the [[Mongol invasion]] in 1241-1242 many of the newly founded towns in the Kingdom of Hungary received the right to use the royal double cross as their coat of arms. The first, biggest and most towns of the kingdom arose in present-day Slovakia{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} - the part of the kingdom that was characterized by German settlers, extensive mining activities and thus the most advanced economy at that time. It was probably partly due to this use in municipal coats of arm that the double cross became a clear symbol of the northern part of the kingdom again from the 15th century onwards and [[Upper Hungary]] from the 18th century.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nFrom the late 14th century onwards (according to other sources from the 13th century), the double cross symbol was used both as a symbol for northern parts of the Kingdom (\"partes Danubii septentrionales, partes regni superiores\", i.e. approximately the territory of present-day Slovakia and northeastern Hungary) and as a symbol of kings of the Kingdom of Hungary. For example, the state symbol of [[Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382) was a quartered coat of arms containing among other symbols the symbol of Charles Robert of Anjou (containing in turn the stripes symbol)  as the symbol for the southern parts of the kingdom (\"partes regni inferiores\") and the symbol for northern parts of the Kingdom (the double cross symbol). A good example of the double meaning of the double cross symbol is the great seal of King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437): This seal contains the double cross symbol in the middle, surrounded by a circle of smaller coats of arms of territories under his rule. These smaller coats of arms include the double cross symbol (for a second time!) as the symbol of what is today Slovakia and the stripes symbol as the symbol for Pannonia.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/>\n\nSince 1526, when the Habsburgs became kings of the Kingdom of Hungary, the current \"combined\" coat of arms of Hungary including the double cross symbol and the stripes symbol was used as the symbol of the Kingdom of Hungary (except that the small crown below the double cross was added only in the 17th century).\n\n== Three hills ==\nThe [[Trimount|triple peak]] represents the three mountain ranges [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]], [[M\u00e1tra|Matra]] and [[Fatra (disambiguation)|Fatra]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->  which symbolized the northern mountainous part of the Kingdom of Hungary. (The Tatra and the Fatra ranges are in present day Slovakia.) This interpretation is probably the oldest and most frequent one \u2013 it can be traced back to the 16th century, but stems probably from the 15th century. According to [[Istv\u00e1n Werb\u0151czy]]'s \"Tripartitum\" from 16th century, the heaps represent the mountains in this order.\n\nThe three mountains below the double cross were used by King [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Ladislaus]] (1301\u20131305), who was crowned king of Hungary, but was a [[Czechs|Czech]] from the house of the [[P\u0159emyslids]].\n\n== Symbol of the Slovaks==\n\n=== Origins and colors===\n[[File:Red star.svg|thumb|right|150px|Coat of arms of [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] (16 June 1919-7 July 1919)]]\n[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Czechoslovakia.svg|thumb|right|150px|Coat of arms of [[Czechoslovakia]] (1920-1960), until [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation|federalization of Czechoslovakia]]]]\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Slovak State (1939-1945).svg|thumb|right|150px|Coat of arms of [[First Slovak Republic]] (1939-1945)]]\n[[File:Coat of arms of Slovakia (1960-1990).svg|thumb|right|150px|Symbol of Slovakia within [[Slovak Socialist Republic]] (1960-1990)]]\nNot later than in the 16th century, the Slovaks regarded the double cross also as a symbol of their nation.<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/> This fact manifested itself during the [[Revolution of 1848]]/1849, Slovaks were fighting along with the Austrians against the Hungarians (though many Slovaks chose to defend the Hungarian case).  A \"[[Slovak National Council (1848\u20131849)|Slovak National Council]]\" was established for this purpose in August 1848 in Vienna. The present-day coat of arms was used on the seal of this Slovak National Council for the first time officially as the national symbol of the Slovaks (instead of being the official symbol of Upper Hungary only). From that time onwards, the symbol has been used very frequently.\n\nAs for the colors, the colors are supposed to be the three \"Slavic\" colors red-white-blue ([[Slavic tricolor]]). Since the Upper Hungary coat of arms was already part of the [[coat of arms of Hungary|coat of arms of the Kingdom of Hungary]] at that time, only the  color of the three mountains had to be changed (it happened on the [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovak flag]] for the first time) from green to \"blue\" to receive the red-white-blue combination.\n\nAs for the origin of the red color (in the Slovak and in the Hungarian coat of arms), the coat of arms has often had the red color as an almost inseparable attendant of the double cross in the coats of many Hungarian and Slovak towns since the Middle Ages. Also, the coat of arms of B\u00e9la III. is thought to have had red background. In general, red background color was used frequently for coats of arms in the late 12th and early 13th century in central Europe. One of the modern interpretations of the color is that it represents the bloody lining and symbolizes the Slovak 'martyrdom' during the time of [[Magyarisation]] (19th century).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe color of the three mountains was originally green but in 1848 the Slovak National Council used it as blue in accordance with the [[Slavic tricolor]].\n\n=== 20th century===\nIn 1918, [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] troops began occupying northern Hungary in accordance with the territorial promises that the [[Triple Entente]] made to Czechoslovak politicians during World War I. However, Slovakia ([[Upper Hungary]]) was occupied by Hungarian troops from the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], who set up the [[Slovak Soviet Republic]] as a puppet regime. Its emblem was the [[red star]], a symbol of communism. Following a brief [[Hungarian\u2013Czechoslovak War|war between Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Romania]], Slovakia was incorporated into Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1920 the Slovak coat of arms became part of the [[Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia|state coat of arms]] of [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nBetween 1939 and 1945, it was the state symbol of the [[First Slovak Republic]].\n\nIn 1945, it became part of Czechoslovakia's coat of arms again. From 1960 to 1990 the symbol was officially forbidden, because it was interpreted by the Communists as the symbol of the fascist [[Slovak State]]. The old coat of arms was replaced in the Czechoslovak coat of arms by an artificial symbol consisting of Mt. [[Kriv\u00e1\u0148 (peak)|Kriv\u00e1\u0148]] and three flames. The three flames were supposed to symbolize the [[Slovak National Uprising]] of 1944.\n\nOn 1 March 1990, after the [[Velvet Revolution]], the old coat of arms became the official symbol of the \"Slovak Republic\", which was still part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Based on the [[Constitution of the Slovak Republic]] of September 3, 1992, the same coat of arms became the symbol of independent [[Slovakia]], which arose on January 1, 1993. A law of February 18, 1993, precised the details of the coat of arms: for example, though not explicitly defined in the coat's [[blazon]] in the past, during the World War II era the cross mostly used to be depicted with convex endings of the stake and the bars; therefore the new description clearly reads to depict them as concave.\n\nThe coat of arms is used by the [[Slovak Air Force]] as its [[roundel]].\n\nSince 1992 the coat of arms is also placed on the [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovak flag]].\n\n=== Part of other symbols===\n[[File:Flag of the President of Slovakia.svg|thumb|right|150px|Flag of the President of Slovakia]]\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Slovakia coat of arms big.svg|thumb|left|upright|Unofficial design for a greater coat of arms of Slovakia]] -->\nIn the 13th century King [[B\u00e9la III]] declared{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} the double cross (ex post) a symbol of Saint Ladislaus (King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]]). In 1386, it became part of the coat of arms of the house of [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiello]], because [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] [[Jogaila]] took over the alleged coat of arms of Saint Ladislaus when being baptized as Ladislaus (Wladyslaw). By means of the Jagiellons, the symbol also got into the [[coat of arms of Lithuania]].\n\nThe [[President of Slovakia]] uses a banner of these arms.\n\nSlovak graphic designer Branislav Novotka<ref name=\"\u0160t\u00e1tny znak Slovenskej republiky\"/> designed a greater coat of arms of Slovakia and registered it at the [[Slovak Chamber of Genealogy and Heraldry]].

One track (14) was  permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as [[SMPTE]] or [[MIDI timecode|MTC]]. Each channel strip included [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto [[Punch in / out|punch in and out]], among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1\" tape.

It is situated 4&nbsp;km south of the border with the [[Netherlands]]. [[Suderwick]] is part of Bocholt and is situated at the border annex to [[Dinxperlo]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe northern border of the city of Bocholt is the German border with the [[Netherlands]]. Bocholt borders the [[Wesel (district)|district of Wesel]], in the [[D\u00fcsseldorf (region)|administrative region of D\u00fcsseldorf]], in the southwest.<ref>[http://www.bocholt.de/fileadmin/DAM/Fachbereich_10/Dokumente/Ortsrecht/bocholt_rathaus_ortsrecht_0101.pdf bocholt Rathaus Ortsrecht] bocholt.de</ref>\n\nBocholt is bordered in the north by the Dutch municipalities of [[Aalten]] and [[Winterswijk]], in the east by the city of [[Rhede]], in the south by the city of [[Hamminkeln]], and in the west by the city of [[Isselburg]].\n\nThe climate in the region of Bocholt and West M\u00fcnsterland is temperate with distinct maritime influences, with very mild winters in comparison to other German regions because of the proximity to the ocean and the low [[elevation]]. Summers are moderately warm. The average temperature in January is 2.7&nbsp;\u00b0C and in July 18.4&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the average year there are 12 days of snow cover, about 31 sunny days (high temperature of 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher) and 6 hot days (30&nbsp;\u00b0C or higher) on average. In the average year there is about 750&nbsp;mm of precipitation, with June (78&nbsp;mm) and April (41&nbsp;mm) being the driest months.\n\n==History==\nBocholt was first written about in 779, when [[Charlemagne]] won a battle against the [[Saxony|Saxon]]s nearby. However the settlement was probably much older. Bishop Dietrich III von Isenburg from [[M\u00fcnster]] gave Bocholt [[Town privileges|city rights]] in 1222.\n\nIn the 15th century the city flourished. The engraver [[Israhel van Meckenem]] lived and worked in the city.\n\nBetween 1803 and 1810 Bocholt was the capital of the [[Principality of Salm]]. The Principality of Salm was governed by the prince of [[Salm-Salm]] and the prince of [[Salm-Kyrburg]].\n\n{{anchor|Allied air attack}}During the Second World War the city survived generally unscathed until an Allied bombing raid on 22 March 1945 which destroyed most of the city. The city was then captured by the British a week later on 28 March. The city was the site of the [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|Stalag VI-F POW camp]].\n\nIn 1975 the former municipalities Barlo, Biemenhorst, Hemden, Holtwick, Liedern, Lowick, Mussum, [[Spork (locality)|Spork]], Stenern and [[Suderwick]] were merged into Bocholt.<ref>[http://www.archive.nrw.de/LAV_NRW/jsp/bestand.jsp?archivNr=208&expandId=61&tektId=22 Amt Liedern-Werth], Archive in Nordrhein-Westfalen</ref>\n\n==Population development==\n\n* 1871=6.125\n* 1880=8.534\n* 1890=13.034\n* 1900=21.278\n* 1910=26.404\n* 1925=30.182\n* 1933=33.441\n* 1939=35.099\n* 1945=29.443\n* 1950=37.674\n* 1961=45.675\n* 1970=48.852\n* 1980=65.352\n* 1987=67.028\n* 2000=72.138\n* 2007=73.560\n* 2010=73.170\n* 2015=71.443\n\n==Economy==\nBocholt is a manufacturing town. It was  centered on the textile industry for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today there are still several successful textile manufacturers in town, but the importance of the textile industry has greatly declined. The major employers today in Bocholt are [[Gigaset Communications|Gigaset]] (Communications) and Mechanical Drives (formerly Flender) (Siemens) - a leading manufacturer of transmissions, especially for wind energy plants. Most of Bocholt's industries are smaller and manufacture highly specialized products. Some of them are international leaders in their particular fields - A Good example is the bicycle company [[ROSE Bikes]]. Local industries profit from cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule) also located in Bocholt as well as with similar institutions in the region.\n\nBocholt is also a regional centre for shopping in the West-M\u00fcnsterland area and draws consumers from the neighbouring rural and small town areas of the Netherlands. The town features an attractive old town shopping area as well as a popular new shopping mall.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms shows a [[beech]] tree, which has been the symbol for the city since the 13th century. Bocholt translated into [[English language|English]] roughly means \"beechwood\". [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Bocholt]\n\n==Cyclists Bocholt==\nBocholt is a designated bicycle city, and almost every citizen has one or more bikes, the bicycle network is vast and convenient. In the summer, foreign motorists need to take care because of the popularity of cycling in the city, and even in winter, many people travel only by bike. Group cycling tours, called \"P\u00e4ttkestouren\", are particularly popular in the spring. Between 2005 and 2006 the city of Bocholt won the ADFC and BUND title of \"most bicycle-friendly city in Germany\" in the category of cities under 100,000 inhabitants. Bocholt is the first city in Germany to have a guarded bike station at a Bustreff and not at a railway station. A second bike station in Bocholt went into operation in 2008.\n\n==Transport==\nBocholt is the last stop on a 25-minute 2-way-1-track train route starting in Wesel traveling north to Bocholt. From Wesel one can transfer to trains that travel south to [[D\u00fcsseldorf Airport]], D\u00fcsseldorf Hauptbahnhof or northwest to [[Emmerich am Rhein]] or Arnhem in the Netherlands.
