There, it is actively taken up by blood [[platelet]]s, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it can serve as a [[vasoconstriction|vasoconstrictor]] or a vasodilator while regulating [[hemostasis]] and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium \u2013 such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from [[Adrenergic nerve fibre|adrenergic nerves]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Vanhoutte PM|title=Serotonin and the vascular wall|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|volume=14|issue=2|pages=189\u2013203|date=February 1987|doi=10.1016/0167-5273(87)90008-8|pmid=3818135}}</ref> Serotonin is also a [[growth factor]] for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing.

As noted, 5-HT signaling does facilitate many neural processes including that of neurogenesis, cell migration and survival, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (Eissa et al., 2018). It was noted that 45% of tested ASD subjects contained high levels of 5-HT in their blood (Eissa et al., 2018). In addition, investigations performed on ASD-like animal models reported that hyperserotonemia significantly reduced the motivation for social interest through inhibition of separation distress, which could be related in the ASD patients that have social impairments (Eissa et al., 2018).\n\n===Outside the nervous system===\n\n====In the digestive tract (emetic)====\nSerotonin regulates gastrointestinal function. The gut is surrounded by [[enterochromaffin cell]]s, which release serotonin in response to food in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the [[Hepatic portal system|veins draining the gut]] collect excess serotonin. There are often serotonin abnormalities in gastrointestinal disorders like constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIf irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates [[5-HT3 receptor]]s in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] that stimulate [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rang HP |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |page=187 |isbn=978-0-443-07145-4}}</ref> Thus, drugs and toxins stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall.

In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium \u2013 such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells.

As noted, 5-HT signaling does facilitate many neural processes including that of neurogenesis, cell migration and survival, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (Eissa et al., 2018). It was noted that 45% of tested ASD subjects contained high levels of 5-HT in their blood (Eissa et al., 2018). In addition, investigations performed on ASD-like animal models reported that hyperserotonemia significantly reduced the motivation for social interest through inhibition of separation distress, which could be related in the ASD patients that have social impairments (Eissa et al., 2018).\n\n===Outside the nervous system===\n\n====In the digestive tract (emetic)====\nSerotonin regulates gastrointestinal function. The gut is surrounded by [[enterochromaffin cell]]s, which release serotonin in response to food in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the [[Hepatic portal system|veins draining the gut]] collect excess serotonin. There are often serotonin abnormalities in gastrointestinal disorders like constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIf irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates [[5-HT3 receptor]]s in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] that stimulate [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Rang HP |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |page=187 |isbn=978-0-443-07145-4}}</ref> Thus, drugs and toxins stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall.
