Regardless, the in-game function of the Apostolic Palace is not religion-specific and the use of the term is representative of religious administration generally, rather than a specific reference to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Apostolic Palace.jpg|Apostolic Palace\nFile:Palais apostolique et aile de Constantin.JPG|Apostolic Palace from St. Peter's Square\nFile:Roma Vatican Scala Regia c1835.jpg|[[Scala Regia (Vatican)|Scala Regia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]\nFile:Apostolic Palace (Lanciani).jpg|Plan of the Apostolic Palace (1893\u20131901)\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Apostolic Palace}}\n{{Portal|Vatican City}}\n* ''[[Domus Sanctae Marthae]]''\n* [[Index of Vatican City-related articles]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation |last=Levillain |first=Philippe |title=Dictionnaire historique de la papaut\u00e9 |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |edition=Illustrated |series=The Papacy: An Encyclopedia |volume=II |isbn=0-415-92230-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3NzTkyUntYC&dq=apostolic+palace |accessdate=20 December 2009}}\n* {{citation |last=Morton |first=H.V. |title=A Traveller in Rome |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2002 |edition=Reprint |isbn=0-306-81131-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU3mJ7BJggC&pg=PA355&dq=apostolic+palace&cd=14#v=onepage&q=apostolic%20palace&f=false |accessdate=20 December 2009}}\n* {{cite book |author= |title=The Vatican: spirit and art of Christian Rome |url=https://archive.org/details/vaticanspirit00metr |location=New York |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1982 |isbn=0870993488 |url-access=registration }}\n\n{{Sistine Chapel}}\n{{Papal symbols and ceremonial}}\n{{Vatican City topics}}\n{{Holy See}}\n{{Catholic Church footer}}\n\n[[Category:Apostolic Palace| ]]\n[[Category:Episcopal palaces]]\n[[Category:Geography of Vatican City]]\n[[Category:Official residences]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Rome]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Vatican City]]\n[[Category:Sistine Chapel]]\n[[Category:Sites of papal elections]]\n[[Category:Official residences in Vatican City]]\n", "name_user": "2001:8004:1282:fb7d:9106:9ef:af04:75eb", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Palace"}

Usually mowing is distinguished from reaping, which uses similar implements, but is the traditional term for [[harvest]]ing grain [[crops]], e.g. with [[reaper]]s and [[combine harvester|combines]].\n\nA smaller mower used for lawns and sports grounds ([[playing field]]s) is called a ''[[lawn mower]]'' or ''grounds mower'', which is often self-powered, or may also be small enough to be pushed by the operator. Grounds mowers have reel or rotary cutters. \nLarger mowers or ''[[Conditioner (farming)|mower-conditioner]]s'' are mainly used to cut grass (or other crops) for [[hay]] or [[silage]] and often place the cut material into rows, which are referred to as ''[[windrow]]s''. ''[[Swather]]s'' (or ''windrowers'') are also used to cut grass (and grain crops).  Prior to the invention and adoption of mechanized mowers, (and today in places where use a mower is impractical or uneconomical), grass and grain crops were cut by hand using [[scythe]]s or [[sickle]]s.\n\n==Mower configurations==\nLarger mowers are usually ''ganged'' (equipped with a number or gang of similar cutting units), so they can adapt individually to ground contours. They may be powered and drawn by a [[tractor]] or [[draft animal]]s. The cutting units can be mounted underneath the tractor between the front and rear [[wheel]]s, mounted on the back with a [[three-point hitch]] or pulled behind the tractor as a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]. There are also dedicated self-propelled cutting machines, which often have the mower units mounted at the front and sides for easy visibility by the driver. ''Boom'' or ''side-arm'' mowers are mounted on long hydraulic arms, similar to a [[backhoe]] arm, which allows the [[tractor]] to mow steep banks or around objects while remaining on a safer surface.\n\n==Mower types==\nThe cutting mechanism in a mower may be one of several different designs:\n\n===Sickle mower===\n[[File:Eicher M\u00e4hbalken.jpg|thumb|[[Eicher tractor]] with a mid-mounted finger-bar mower]]\n''Sickle mowers'', also called ''reciprocating mowers'', ''bar mowers'', ''sickle-bar mowers'', or ''finger-bar mowers'', have a long (typically six to seven and a half feet) bar on which are mounted fingers with stationary guardplates.  In a channel on the bar there is a reciprocating sickle with very sharp sickle sections (triangular blades). The sickle bar is driven back and forth along the channel. The grass, or other plant matter, is cut between the sharp edges of the sickle sections and the finger-plates (this action can be likened to an electric hair clipper).\n\nThe bar rides on the ground, supported on a skid at the inner end, and it can be tilted to adjust the height of the cut. A spring-loaded board at the outer end of the bar guides the cut hay away from the uncut hay. The so-formed channel, between cut and uncut material, allows the mower skid to ride in the channel and cut only uncut grass cleanly on the next swath. These were the first successful horse-drawn mowers on farms and the general principles still guide the design of modern mowers.\n\n===Rotary mower===\n[[File:WindrowerRotaryCutter.JPG|thumb|Rotary cutters mounted on a swather]]\n[[Rotary mower]]s, also called ''drum mowers'', have a rapidly rotating bar, or disks mounted on a bar, with sharpened edges that cut the crop. When these mowers are tractor-mounted they are easily capable of mowing grass at up to 20 miles per hour (32&nbsp;km/h) in good conditions. Some models are designed to be mounted in double and triple sets on a tractor, one in the front and one at each side, thus able to cut up to 20 foot (6 metre) swaths.\n\nIn rough cutting conditions, the blades attached to the disks are swivelled to absorb blows from obstructions. Mostly these are rear-mounted units and in some countries are called ''scrub cutters''. Self-powered mowers of this type are used for rougher grass in gardening and other land maintenance.\n\n===Reel mower===\n[[File:Rusted reel mower.JPG|thumb|Reel mower]]\n''Reel mowers'', also called ''cylinder mowers'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelmowers.org|title=Reel Mowers|publisher=}}</ref> (familiar as the hand-pushed or self-powered cylinder [[lawn mower]]), have a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel composed of helical blades, each of which in turn runs past a horizontal cutter-bar, producing a continuous scissor action. The bar is held at an adjustable level just above the ground and the reel runs at a speed dependent on the forward movement speed of the machine, driven by wheels running on the ground (or in self-powered applications by a motor). The cut grass may be gathered in a collection bin.\n\nThis type of mower is used to produce consistently short and even grass on bowling greens, lawns, parks and sports grounds. When pulled by a tractor (or formerly by a horse), these mowers are often ganged into sets of three, five or more, to form a ''gang mower''.  A well-designed reel mower can cut quite tangled and thick tall grass, but this type works best on fairly short, upright vegetation, as taller vegetation tends to be rolled flat rather than cut.\n\nHome reel mowers have certain benefits over motor-powered mowers as they are quieter and not dependent on any extra form of power besides the person doing the mowing.  This is useful not only to lessen dependence on other types of power which may have availability issues, but also lessens the impact on the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eartheasy.com/article_reel_mower.htm|title=Switching to a reel mower|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Flail mower===\n[[File:M\u00e4hschlegel.JPG|thumb|[[Flail mower]]]]\n[[Flail mower]]s have a number of small blades on the end of chains attached to a horizontal axis. The cutting is carried out by the ax-like heads striking the grass at speed. These types are used on rough ground, where the blades may frequently be fouled by other objects, or on tougher vegetation than grass, such as brush (scrub). Due to the length of the chains and the higher weight of the blades, they are better at cutting thick brush than other mowers, because of the relatively high inertia of the blades.  In some types the cut material may be gathered in a collection bin.  As a boom mower (see above), a flail mower may be used in an upright position for trimming the sides of hedges, when it is often called a ''hedge-cutter''.\n\n===Drum mower===\n[[File:Fella Radon Drum Mower.jpg|thumb|Fella Radon Drum Mower]]\n[[Drum mower]]s have their horizontally-mounted cutting blades attached to the outside of a relatively large diameter disc fixed to the bottom of a smaller diameter drum and are principally designed for cutting lighter crops, such as grass, very quickly.

In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]].

With the exception of the first term, it has always been held by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who became Labour's first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929. Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of [[Neil Kinnock]], who was Labour leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1983 to 1992.\n\nIt is one of the most consistently [[safe seat]]s for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat. In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. The 2017 result also made Aberavon the safest Labour seat in Wales, however the seat saw a significant swing against Labour in 2019.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The Borough of Aberavon, the Urban Districts of Briton Ferry, Glencorwg, Margam, and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural Districts of Neath and Penybont.\n\n'''1950\u20131983''': The Borough of Port Talbot, the Urban Districts of Glyncorrwg and Porthcawl, and part of the Rural District of Penybont.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The Borough of Afan, and the Borough of Neath wards nos. 3 and 6.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The Borough of Port Talbot, and the Borough of Neath wards of Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North and Coedffranc West.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The Neath Port Talbot County Borough electoral divisions of Aberavon, Baglan, Briton Ferry East, Briton Ferry West, Bryn and Cwmavon, Coedffranc Central, Coedffranc North, Coedffranc West, Cymmer, Glyncorrwg, Gwynfi, Margam, Port Talbot, Sandfields East, Sandfields West, and Tai-bach.\n\nThe constituency is in [[South Wales]], situated on the right bank of the [[River Afan]], near its mouth in [[Swansea Bay]].\n\nCommenting on the 1983 boundary changes to the constituency when moving the 2000 Loyal Address of the Blair Government in Parliament, then-MP [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon|Sir John Morris]], who would retire at [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the next general election]], said:\n\n{{quote|It is a happy tradition on this occasion to refer to one's constituency and to the people who sent one here....Whatever may occur in future, I would deplore the loss of the Member-constituency link.

Of those employed in 2013: 15.0% were clerical and administrative workers (the highest proportion of any general electorate); 12.6% worked in public administration (third-highest); 10.4% were community and personal service workers (fourth-highest). Of those working on census day 2013, 9.1% travelled to work [[Public transport in the Wellington Region#Trains|by train]], the third-highest share among general electorates and almost eight times the New Zealand average (1.2%).<ref name=\"Electorate profile\" />\n\n==History==\nRimutaka was created in {{NZ election link year|1996}} ahead of the change to [[Mixed Member Proportional]] voting. It was created by merging the old Upper Hutt-based seat of {{NZ electorate link|Heretaunga}} with [[Stokes Valley, New Zealand|Stokes Valley]], [[Tait\u0101, New Zealand|Tait\u0101]] and a large section of [[Naenae]] from the defunct {{NZ electorate link|Eastern Hutt}} seat. Eastern Hutt had been held by Labour's [[Paul Swain]] since {{NZ election link year|1987}}, while Heretaunga had been won by National's [[Peter McCardle]] in {{NZ election link year|1990}}. Peter McCardle (who had been re-elected in {{NZ election link year|1993}}) defected to [[New Zealand First]] in 1996. Swain was the clear winner in every election from 1996 to 2005; the inclusion of the working-class areas of [[Hutt City]] helped make Rimutaka safer for the Labour Party, though on the campaign trail in 2008, Labour's chances for winning both party vote and the electorate were summarised as: \"Labour support is 'rock solid' in the south of the electorate but things are volatile in Upper Hutt, where there is 'still work to do'\".<ref name=\"stuff_whatyoutalkingaboutfonz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4741314a28627.html |title=Labour stronghold shapes up as a battleground  |date=28 October 2008|accessdate=1 November 2008 |publisher=stuff.co.nz}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 2014 boundary review, Rimutaka gained [[Naenae]] and a small part of [[Epuni]] from the {{NZ electorate link|Hutt South}} electorate and lost [[Kelson, New Zealand|Kelson]] and [[Belmont, Wellington|Belmont]] to Hutt South.\n\nFollowing the 2016 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and Rangit\u0101ne o Wairarapa and Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa T\u0101maki Nui-\u0101-Rua, the electorate's namesake Rimutaka Range was renamed to the Remutaka Range. In the 2019/2020 boundary review, the Representation Commission is proposing to rename the Rimutaka electorate to Remutaka in line with this name change. A final decision is expected in April 2020. The renamed electorate would first be used in the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]] and the successful candidate would first represent the area in the [[53rd New Zealand Parliament|53rd Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |title=What's happening now in the boundary review |url= https://vote.nz/boundary-review-2019-2020/whats-happening-now-in-the-boundary-review/ |accessdate=29 January 2020 | publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]}}</ref>\n\n===Members of Parliament===\nUnless otherwise stated, all MPs terms began and ended at general elections.\n\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}}\n{{Party index link|New Zealand First}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=100| Election\n! width=175 colspan=2 | Winner \n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1996}}\n| width=5 rowspan=4 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=4 | [[Paul Swain]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1999}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2002}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2008}}\n| width=5 rowspan=4 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=4 | [[Chris Hipkins]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2011}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2017}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Rimutaka electorate.

Boundary changes in 2014 saw Rimutaka gain Naenae from the [[Hutt South]] electorate, while losing [[Belmont, Wellington|Belmont]] and [[Kelson]] to Hutt South.<ref name=\"Electorate profile\">{{cite web |title= Rimutaka electorate profile|url= https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/DBHOH_Lib_EP_Rimutaka_Electoral_Profile/2876f2efce03171201147a2bdcd66238da607347 |date= June 2015 |publisher= Parliamentary Library |accessdate= 19 December 2016}}{{CC-notice|cc=by3|author=the Parliamentary Library}}</ref>\n\nPopulation growth in the Rimutaka electorate was 2.4% between 2006 and [[2013 New Zealand census|2013]], less than half the national average (5.3%). Of those employed in 2013: 15.0% were clerical and administrative workers (the highest proportion of any general electorate); 12.6% worked in public administration (third-highest); 10.4% were community and personal service workers (fourth-highest). Of those working on census day 2013, 9.1% travelled to work [[Public transport in the Wellington Region#Trains|by train]], the third-highest share among general electorates and almost eight times the New Zealand average (1.2%).<ref name=\"Electorate profile\" />\n\n==History==\nRimutaka was created in {{NZ election link year|1996}} ahead of the change to [[Mixed Member Proportional]] voting. It was created by merging the old Upper Hutt-based seat of {{NZ electorate link|Heretaunga}} with [[Stokes Valley, New Zealand|Stokes Valley]], [[Tait\u0101, New Zealand|Tait\u0101]] and a large section of [[Naenae]] from the defunct {{NZ electorate link|Eastern Hutt}} seat. Eastern Hutt had been held by Labour's [[Paul Swain]] since {{NZ election link year|1987}}, while Heretaunga had been won by National's [[Peter McCardle]] in {{NZ election link year|1990}}. Peter McCardle (who had been re-elected in {{NZ election link year|1993}}) defected to [[New Zealand First]] in 1996. Swain was the clear winner in every election from 1996 to 2005; the inclusion of the working-class areas of [[Hutt City]] helped make Rimutaka safer for the Labour Party, though on the campaign trail in 2008, Labour's chances for winning both party vote and the electorate were summarised as: \"Labour support is 'rock solid' in the south of the electorate but things are volatile in Upper Hutt, where there is 'still work to do'\".<ref name=\"stuff_whatyoutalkingaboutfonz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4741314a28627.html |title=Labour stronghold shapes up as a battleground  |date=28 October 2008|accessdate=1 November 2008 |publisher=stuff.co.nz}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 2014 boundary review, Rimutaka gained [[Naenae]] and a small part of [[Epuni]] from the {{NZ electorate link|Hutt South}} electorate and lost [[Kelson, New Zealand|Kelson]] and [[Belmont, Wellington|Belmont]] to Hutt South.\n\nFollowing the 2016 Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and Rangit\u0101ne o Wairarapa and Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa T\u0101maki Nui-\u0101-Rua, the electorate's namesake Rimutaka Range was renamed to the Remutaka Range. In the 2019/2020 boundary review, the Representation Commission is proposing to rename the Rimutaka electorate to Remutaka in line with this name change. A final decision is expected in April 2020. The renamed electorate would first be used in the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]] and the successful candidate would first represent the area in the [[53rd New Zealand Parliament|53rd Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |title=What's happening now in the boundary review |url= https://vote.nz/boundary-review-2019-2020/whats-happening-now-in-the-boundary-review/ |accessdate=29 January 2020 | publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]]}}</ref>\n\n===Members of Parliament===\nUnless otherwise stated, all MPs terms began and ended at general elections.\n\n'''Key'''\n\n{{Party index link|New Zealand Labour Party}}\n{{Party index link|New Zealand First}}\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=100| Election\n! width=175 colspan=2 | Winner \n|-\n| {{NZ election link|1996}}\n| width=5 rowspan=4 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=4 | [[Paul Swain]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|1999}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2002}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2005}}\n|-\n| {{NZ election link|2008}}\n| width=5 rowspan=4 bgcolor={{New Zealand Labour Party/meta/color}}|\n| rowspan=4 | [[Chris Hipkins]]\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2011}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2014}}\n|-\n|{{NZ election link|2017}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===List MPs===\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested the Rimutaka electorate.

Davis went a season-high eight innings to win his final Triple-A start against the [[Charlotte Knights]] on July 22, allowing two runs on seven hits. He was called up to Pittsburgh where he made appearances, going 2-4 with a 5.29 ERA in 34 innings. Davis made his first start against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] on August 10, holding the Phillies to no earned runs on four hits and four walks over six innings. He declined a minor league assignment on December 10, 2008, becoming a free agent. He had been mentioned as possibly going to pitch in [[Japan]],<ref>[http://www.fantasysp.com/player/mlb/Jason_Davis/163238]</ref> but instead re-signed with the Pirates.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn Davis's spare time, he pursues an interest in [[taxidermy]]. His home was filled with trophies that he hunted and then stuffed and mounted himself, including the heads of 21 deer. He was married to a beautiful woman with 4 amazing kids, Lily, Jaxon, Landon, and Sadie. But Davis decided that what he had wasn't enough to fulfill his lifestyle so he decided to leave his family for one of his coworkers. She was also married.

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).
