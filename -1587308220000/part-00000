The county also included six Parliamentary Boroughs, namely [[Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Amersham]], [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]], [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Chipping Wycombe]], [[Great Marlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Marlow]] and [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]], all returning 2 MPs each.\n\n==== 1832-1885 ====\nThe [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832 radically changed the representation of the House of Commons, with the County's representation being increased to 3 MPs and the Boroughs of Amersham and Wendover abolished. Unusually, the contents of the Parliamentary Borough of Aylesbury were defined within the Act itself to include the \"Three Hundreds of Aylesbury\", which extended the seat to include [[Wendover]] and [[Princes Risborough]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/sheet/bc_reports_1868/Aylesbury_1868|title=H.M.S.O.

The remaining Parliamentary Boroughs were all abolished and absorbed into the County Divisions which took their names, with Great Marlow being absorbed into the Wycombe Division, which also included [[Beaconsfield]] and [[Slough]].\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Buckinghamshire since 1885.

It also authorised an initial review to subdivide abnormally large constituencies in time for the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]].  This was implemented by the Redistribution of Seats Order 1945 under which Buckinghamshire was allocated an additional seat.  As a consequence, the new County Constituency of [[Eton and Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Eton and Slough]] was formed from the Wycombe constituency, comprising the [[Municipal Borough of Slough]], the Urban District of Eton and the parishes to the south of Beaconsfield making up the Rural District of Eton.  To compensate partly for the loss of these areas, the parts of the Rural District of Wycombe not in the constituency thereof, which included Princes Risborough and [[Hughenden Valley|Hughenden]], were transferred from Aylesbury.\n\n==== 1950-1974 ====\nThe [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] increased the county's representation once again, from 4 to 5 MPs, with the creation of the County Constituency of South Buckinghamshire. This comprised Beaconsfield, Amersham and the Chalfonts, transferred from Aylesbury, and the Rural District of Eton, transferred from Eton and Slough (which was redesignated as a Borough Constituency). There were no changes for the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] under the [[First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|First Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]].\n\n==== 1974-1983 ====\nUnder the Second Periodic Review, representation was increased to 6 MPs with the formation of the new County Constituencies of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] and [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]], which largely replaced the abolished South Buckinghamshire constituency.  Beaconsfield comprised the Urban District of Beaconsfield and the Rural District of Eton, while Chesham and Amersham combined Amersham and the Chalfonts with [[Chesham]] and the remaining, northern part of the Rural District of Amersham, transferred from Aylesbury.  The northern parts of the Rural District of Wycombe, including Princes Risborough (but not Hughenden) were transferred back from Wycombe to Aylesbury.  Buckingham lost [[Linslade]] which had been transferred to Bedfordshire on its amalgamation with the neighbouring Urban District of [[Leighton Buzzard Urban District|Leighton Buzzard]] and was now included in the constituency of [[South Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Bedfordshire]].\n\n==== 1983-1992 ====\nThe Third Review reflected the changes to the county of Buckinghamshire arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972]], resulting in Eton, Slough and some surrounding areas being transferred to Berkshire. The constituency of Eton and Slough was abolished with the area constituting the [[Slough Borough Council|Borough of Slough]] forming the new Borough Constituency of [[Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Slough]], and the small Urban District of Eton which was absorbed into the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]] being included in the County Constituency of [[Windsor and Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor and Maidenhead]].  The parishes of the Rural District of Eton also transferred to Berkshire, which included [[Datchet]], were transferred from Beaconsfield and included in the new County Constituency of [[East Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Berkshire]]. \n\nIn the north of the county, the new County Constituency of [[Milton Keynes (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes]] was formed from parts of the Buckingham constituency.  This reflected the growth of the new town of [[Milton Keynes]] since its foundation in 1967.  The new constituency comprised the Borough of Milton Keynes, with the exception of [[Stony Stratford]] and [[Wolverton]], which were retained in Buckingham.  In turn, Buckingham gained north-western parts of the Aylesbury constituency.\n\nElsewhere, [[Great Missenden]] was transferred from Chesham and Amersham to Aylesbury, [[Hazlemere]] from Wycombe to Chesham and Amersham and areas to the east of [[High Wycombe]] from Wycombe to Beaconsfield.\n\n==== 1992-1997 ====\nUniquely outside the normal cycle of periodic reviews by the Boundaries Commission, the constituency of Milton Keynes, due to its rapid growth, was split into two separate constituencies for the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]]: the County Constituency of [[North East Milton Keynes (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Milton Keynes]] and the Borough Constituency of [[Milton Keynes South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South West]].  Stony Stratford and Wolverton were transferred from Buckingham and included in Milton Keynes South West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/1307/contents/made/data.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) (Miscellaneous Changes) Order 1990|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==== 1997-2010 ====\nThe Fourth Review saw only minor changes to the Buckinghamshire constituencies, included the transfer of the [[Aylesbury Vale|District of Aylesbury Vale]] ward of [[Aston Clinton]] from Aylesbury to Buckingham. \n\n==== 2010-present ====\nIn the [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Fifth Review]] the [[Boundary Commission for England]] proposed changes to realign constituency boundaries with the boundaries of current local government wards, and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies. The changes included the return of Great Missenden to Chesham and Amersham, Hazlemere to Wycombe and Aston Clinton to Buckingham.  In addition, [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] was transferred from Wycombe to Beaconsfield and Princes Risborough from Aylesbury to Buckingham. The boundary between the two Milton Keynes constituencies was realigned and they were renamed as [[Milton Keynes North (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North]] and [[Milton Keynes South (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South]].\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" \n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Name!! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Pre-2010 boundaries\n|-\n|\n#[[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] CC\n#[[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] CC\n#[[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] CC\n#[[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]] CC\n#[[Milton Keynes South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South West]] BC\n#[[Milton Keynes North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North East]] CC\n#[[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] CC \n|[[Image:BuckinghamshireParliamentaryConstituenciesNumbered.svg|left|Parliamentary constituencies in Buckinghamshire]]\n|-\n|}\n\n{| border=1 cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" \n|-\n!bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Revised name!!bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Post-2010 boundaries\n|-\n|\n# [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] CC\n# [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] CC\n# [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] CC\n# [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]] CC\n# [[Milton Keynes North (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North]] CC\n# [[Milton Keynes South (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South]] BC\n# [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] CC\n|[[Image:BuckinghamshireParliamentaryConstituencies2007.svg|left|Proposed Revised constituencies in Buckinghamshire]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Changes proposed in 2018==\nThe [[Boundary Commission for England]] submitted their final proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. If these proposals are approved by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they will come into effect at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]].\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=16 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn order to meet these requirements, the Commission was able to treat Buckinghamshire (including the unitary authority of Milton Keynes) as a sub-region of the South East Region and recommended that the county retained seven seats, one of which ([[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]]) was unchanged. The constituency of [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] would be moved northwards, gaining south-eastern parts of Buckingham, including [[Wing, Buckinghamshire|Wing]]. South-eastern areas, including [[Stokenchurch]], would be transferred to [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] and south-western areas, including [[Hughenden Valley|Greater Hughenden]], to [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]].<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nIt was proposed that [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] regain the parts of the [[Borough of Milton Keynes]] it had lost in 1992 - [[Wolverton]] from [[Milton Keynes North (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North]] and [[Stony Stratford]] from [[Milton Keynes South (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South]] and, consequently, be renamed '''Buckingham and Milton Keynes West'''.  The boundary between the two Milton Keynes constituencies would be realigned once again, with [[Bradwell, Milton Keynes|Bradwell]] and [[Stantonbury]] being transferred from North to South, and south-eastern parts of the Borough moving in the opposite direction.

The county also included six Parliamentary Boroughs, namely [[Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Amersham]], [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]], [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]], [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Chipping Wycombe]], [[Great Marlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Marlow]] and [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]], all returning 2 MPs each.\n\n==== 1832-1885 ====\nThe [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832 radically changed the representation of the House of Commons, with the County's representation being increased to 3 MPs and the Boroughs of Amersham and Wendover abolished. Unusually, the contents of the Parliamentary Borough of Aylesbury were defined within the Act itself to include the \"Three Hundreds of Aylesbury\", which extended the seat to include [[Wendover]] and [[Princes Risborough]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/sheet/bc_reports_1868/Aylesbury_1868|title=H.M.S.O.

The remaining Parliamentary Boroughs were all abolished and absorbed into the County Divisions which took their names, with Great Marlow being absorbed into the Wycombe Division, which also included [[Beaconsfield]] and [[Slough]].\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Buckinghamshire since 1885.

It also authorised an initial review to subdivide abnormally large constituencies in time for the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]].  This was implemented by the Redistribution of Seats Order 1945 under which Buckinghamshire was allocated an additional seat.  As a consequence, the new County Constituency of [[Eton and Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Eton and Slough]] was formed from the Wycombe constituency, comprising the [[Municipal Borough of Slough]], the Urban District of Eton and the parishes to the south of Beaconsfield making up the Rural District of Eton.  To compensate partly for the loss of these areas, the parts of the Rural District of Wycombe not in the constituency thereof, which included Princes Risborough and [[Hughenden Valley|Hughenden]], were transferred from Aylesbury.\n\n==== 1950-1974 ====\nThe [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] increased the county's representation once again, from 4 to 5 MPs, with the creation of the County Constituency of South Buckinghamshire. This comprised Beaconsfield, Amersham and the Chalfonts, transferred from Aylesbury, and the Rural District of Eton, transferred from Eton and Slough (which was redesignated as a Borough Constituency). There were no changes for the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] under the [[First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|First Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]].\n\n==== 1974-1983 ====\nUnder the Second Periodic Review, representation was increased to 6 MPs with the formation of the new County Constituencies of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] and [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]], which largely replaced the abolished South Buckinghamshire constituency.  Beaconsfield comprised the Urban District of Beaconsfield and the Rural District of Eton, while Chesham and Amersham combined Amersham and the Chalfonts with [[Chesham]] and the remaining, northern part of the Rural District of Amersham, transferred from Aylesbury.  The northern parts of the Rural District of Wycombe, including Princes Risborough (but not Hughenden) were transferred back from Wycombe to Aylesbury.  Buckingham lost [[Linslade]] which had been transferred to Bedfordshire on its amalgamation with the neighbouring Urban District of [[Leighton Buzzard Urban District|Leighton Buzzard]] and was now included in the constituency of [[South Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Bedfordshire]].\n\n==== 1983-1992 ====\nThe Third Review reflected the changes to the county of Buckinghamshire arising from the [[Local Government Act 1972]], resulting in Eton, Slough and some surrounding areas being transferred to Berkshire. The constituency of Eton and Slough was abolished with the area constituting the [[Slough Borough Council|Borough of Slough]] forming the new Borough Constituency of [[Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Slough]], and the small Urban District of Eton which was absorbed into the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]] being included in the County Constituency of [[Windsor and Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor and Maidenhead]].  The parishes of the Rural District of Eton also transferred to Berkshire, which included [[Datchet]], were transferred from Beaconsfield and included in the new County Constituency of [[East Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Berkshire]]. \n\nIn the north of the county, the new County Constituency of [[Milton Keynes (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes]] was formed from parts of the Buckingham constituency.  This reflected the growth of the new town of [[Milton Keynes]] since its foundation in 1967.  The new constituency comprised the Borough of Milton Keynes, with the exception of [[Stony Stratford]] and [[Wolverton]], which were retained in Buckingham.  In turn, Buckingham gained north-western parts of the Aylesbury constituency.\n\nElsewhere, [[Great Missenden]] was transferred from Chesham and Amersham to Aylesbury, [[Hazlemere]] from Wycombe to Chesham and Amersham and areas to the east of [[High Wycombe]] from Wycombe to Beaconsfield.\n\n==== 1992-1997 ====\nUniquely outside the normal cycle of periodic reviews by the Boundaries Commission, the constituency of Milton Keynes, due to its rapid growth, was split into two separate constituencies for the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]]: the County Constituency of [[North East Milton Keynes (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Milton Keynes]] and the Borough Constituency of [[Milton Keynes South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South West]].  Stony Stratford and Wolverton were transferred from Buckingham and included in Milton Keynes South West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/1307/contents/made/data.htm|title=The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) (Miscellaneous Changes) Order 1990|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-02-10}}</ref>\n\n==== 1997-2010 ====\nThe Fourth Review saw only minor changes to the Buckinghamshire constituencies, included the transfer of the [[Aylesbury Vale|District of Aylesbury Vale]] ward of [[Aston Clinton]] from Aylesbury to Buckingham. \n\n==== 2010-present ====\nIn the [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Fifth Review]] the [[Boundary Commission for England]] proposed changes to realign constituency boundaries with the boundaries of current local government wards, and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies. The changes included the return of Great Missenden to Chesham and Amersham, Hazlemere to Wycombe and Aston Clinton to Buckingham.  In addition, [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] was transferred from Wycombe to Beaconsfield and Princes Risborough from Aylesbury to Buckingham. The boundary between the two Milton Keynes constituencies was realigned and they were renamed as [[Milton Keynes North (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North]] and [[Milton Keynes South (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South]].\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" \n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Name!! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Pre-2010 boundaries\n|-\n|\n#[[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] CC\n#[[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] CC\n#[[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] CC\n#[[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]] CC\n#[[Milton Keynes South West (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South West]] BC\n#[[Milton Keynes North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North East]] CC\n#[[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] CC \n|[[Image:BuckinghamshireParliamentaryConstituenciesNumbered.svg|left|Parliamentary constituencies in Buckinghamshire]]\n|-\n|}\n\n{| border=1 cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" \n|-\n!bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Revised name!!bgcolor=\"#ff9999\"|Post-2010 boundaries\n|-\n|\n# [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] CC\n# [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]] CC\n# [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] CC\n# [[Chesham and Amersham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chesham and Amersham]] CC\n# [[Milton Keynes North (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes North]] CC\n# [[Milton Keynes South (UK Parliament constituency)|Milton Keynes South]] BC\n# [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] CC\n|[[Image:BuckinghamshireParliamentaryConstituencies2007.svg|left|Proposed Revised constituencies in Buckinghamshire]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Changes proposed for 2019==\nThe [[Boundary Commission for England]] submitted their final proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018.

The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=16 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn order to meet these requirements, the Commission was able to treat Buckinghamshire (including the unitary authority of Milton Keynes) as a sub-region of the South East Region and recommended that the county retained seven seats, one of which ([[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]]) was unchanged. The constituency of [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] would be moved northwards, gaining south-eastern parts of Buckingham, including [[Wing, Buckinghamshire|Wing]].

He was temporarily sealed away and brought to Earth; however, '''Bibidi''' was killed and Buu remained hidden. During the events of ''Dragon Ball'', he is revived by Bibidi's son [[Babidi]] in order to carry on his father's plan to conquer the entire universe.\n\n==Creation and design==\nManga author Akira Toriyama stated that when creating a villain in ''Dragon Ball'', he would try to make them different from any that had come before.

His appearance, magical powers, the manner in which he appeared from his ball, longevity, and the manner in which he is summoned to Earth by an evil warlock using the life-force of his victims are all somewhat genie-esque, an aspect further implied in the Japanese word \"Majin\" in his name, which can read as \"Djinn\", which lead to Viz Media rendering his name as Djinn-Boo for the English manga release. His trousers, in all forms he takes, bear the same \"M\" symbol like many other characters associated with Babidi in this part of the manga; whether this is short for Buu's title of \"Majin\", Babidi's title of \"Madoshi\" in the original Japanese, or something else is unclear. In a 2007 interview printed in ''Shonen Jump'', Akira Toriyama stated that Buu's design was inspired by adaptations of ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' that he watched as a child.\n\nMajin Buu's manner is very naive and childlike, taking joy in fighting and scaring people.

His appearance, magical powers, the manner in which he appeared from his ball, longevity, and the manner in which he is summoned to Earth by an evil warlock using the life-force of his victims are all somewhat genie-esque, an aspect further implied in the Japanese word \"Majin\" in his name, which can read as \"Djinn\", which lead to Viz Media rendering his name as Djinn-Boo for the English manga release. His trousers, in all forms he takes, bear the same \"M\" symbol like many other characters associated with Babidi in this part of the manga; whether this is short for Buu's title of \"Majin\", Babidi's title of \"Madoshi\" in the original Japanese, or something else is unclear. In a 2007 interview printed in ''Shonen Jump'', Akira Toriyama stated that Buu's design was inspired by adaptations of ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' that he watched as a child.\n\nMajin Buu's manner is very naive and childlike, taking joy in fighting and scaring people. Throughout the series, he is always referred to by either Majin Buu or simply Buu, no matter what form he is in. However, each form has been given their own names in guidebooks, video games or by fans, in order to distinguish between them.

He is able to channel his inner [[Qi|Ki]] energy for devastating offensive techniques capable of destroying planets or star systems. Buu also holds the unique ability of being able to transform objects or living things into chocolate or other sweet foods which he then consumes to satiate his greed and gluttony.
