The championship, which was the 28th [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], began on 1 March 1987 at [[Calder Park Raceway]] and ended on 5 July at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after nine rounds. The [[Calder Park V8 Supercar round|Calder round]] saw the world debut of the racing versions of the [[E30 M3|BMW M3]], the [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] and the [[Alfa Romeo 75|Alfa Romeo 75 Turbo]].\n\nAfter years of racing for very little in prize money which brought numerous complaints from the leading competitors (in [[1984 Australian Touring Car Championship|1984]], [[Dick Johnson Racing]] (DJR) had travelled an estimated 20,000&nbsp;km to races around the country from their [[Brisbane]] base, often for as little as [[Australian dollar|A$]]1,200 in prize money, far less money that was on offer at the time for the lower ranked [[Group E Series Production Touring Cars|Group E Series Production]] \"Super Series\" which offered a total prize pool of $200,000 thanks to series sponsor [[Bob Jane T-Marts]]), CAMS signed a [[Australian dollar|AU$]]275,000 sponsorship package with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] which brought the championship an overall sponsor for the first time and saw the series promoted as the '''Shell Ultra Australian Touring Car Championship'''.<ref>Graham Howard & Stewart Wilson, Australian Touring Car Championship, 30 fabulous years, 1989, page 290</ref>\n\nShell would also become the major sponsor of DJR which saw the team expand to running two cars for the first time. The team ran a pair of the new [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]]s for team boss [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] and his [[1986 James Hardie 1000]] co-driver [[Gregg Hansford]]. Dick Johnson's win in Round 5 at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] was the world's first race victory for the Sierra RS Cosworth and was also Dick's first ATCC win since Round 4 of the [[1984 Australian Touring Car Championship|1984 ATCC]] at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]].\n\nThe 1987 ATCC was the first time since [[1975 Australian Touring Car Championship|1975]] that [[Peter Brock]] failed to win a round of the championship, his best finish being a 3rd at [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] in [[Tasmania]] in Round 2 where his 4.9L [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A]] was simply out-gunned on a noted power circuit by the [[Roadways Racing]] Commodore of [[Allan Grice]] (before his race ended), the [[Gibson Motorsport|factory]] [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline turbo]] of race winner [[George Fury]], while his heavy Commodore was no match on tyres and brakes for the [[Inline 4|4 cyl]], [[BMW S14|2.3L]] BMW M3 of Jim Richards. Brock did manage to hold second behind runaway early leader Grice for a number of laps, but once Fury was through the Skyline drove away from Brock and he then had no answer to the challenge of Richards.\n\nThe 1987 championship was also the first time since [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]] that a Holden car failed to win a round of the ATCC, the best result being a second by [[Larry Perkins]] in the opening round at Calder.\n\nThe 1987 ATCC was also the first time in championship history that rolling starts were used. Rolling starts were used at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder]] for Round 1 and at Adelaide for Round 5.\n\nJim Richards victory in the final round of the series at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] would be the last time a car powered by a [[naturally aspirated engine]] would win an ATCC race until [[Tony Longhurst]] won Round 6 of the [[1991 Australian Touring Car Championship]] driving a [[BMW M3|BMW M3 Evolution]]. Between 1988 and Round 6 in 1991, turbo powered cars would win 30 straight ATCC races, 21 of them by the Sierra Cosworth's evolution replacement which appeared after the 1987 ATCC, the [[Ford Sierra RS500]].\n\n1987 was a year of lasts in Australian touring car racing. It was the last time Peter Brock would drive a Holden until [[1991 Australian Touring Car season|1991]] as he would switch first to [[BMW]] in [[1988 Australian Touring Car season|1988]] and then [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] in [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]] and [[1990 Australian Touring Car season|1990]]. Consequently, it was the last time the [[Holden Dealer Team]] name, which started under [[Harry Firth]] in 1969, would be used, though the team officially ran as \"HDT Racing Pty Ltd\" as it was no longer the factory backed team following Holden's well publicised split with Brock in February only one week before the opening round at Calder. Prior to Calder, Holden had formed the Holden Motorsport Group and immediately signed Larry Perkins and [[Perkins Engineering|his team]] as well as Allan Grice and Roadways Racing to be the 'factory backed' teams in the championship, though Grice would later say that it was more about moral support and an easier supply of parts rather than any financial support. It would also be [[Colin Bond]]'s last year of racing [[Alfa Romeo]]'s before switching back to Ford to run a Sierra RS500 from 1988 (largely due to Alfa stopping its development program of the Alfa 75 touring car and because Bond felt that he needed an outright car to do justice to his sponsor [[Caltex]]). It was also the last time the [[JPS Team BMW]] (who won their second title) would be seen with team boss [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] unexpectedly closing the team down at the end of the year.\n\n==Teams and drivers==\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1987 [[Australian Touring Car Championship]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:

1987\n}}\n\nThe '''1987 Australian Touring Car Championship''' was a motor racing competition which was open to [[Touring car racing|Touring Cars]] complying with regulations as defined by the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] and based on [[FIA]] [[Group A]] rules. The championship, which was the 28th [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], began on 1 March 1987 at [[Calder Park Raceway]] and ended on 5 July at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after nine rounds. The [[Calder Park V8 Supercar round|Calder round]] saw the world debut of the racing versions of the [[E30 M3|BMW M3]], the [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] and the [[Alfa Romeo 75|Alfa Romeo 75 Turbo]].\n\nAfter years of racing for very little in prize money which brought numerous complaints from the leading competitors (in [[1984 Australian Touring Car Championship|1984]], [[Dick Johnson Racing]] (DJR) had travelled an estimated 20,000&nbsp;km to races around the country from their [[Brisbane]] base, often for as little as [[Australian dollar|A$]]1,200 in prize money, far less money that was on offer at the time for the lower ranked [[Group E Series Production Touring Cars|Group E Series Production]] \"Super Series\" which offered a total prize pool of $200,000 thanks to series sponsor [[Bob Jane T-Marts]]), CAMS signed a [[Australian dollar|AU$]]275,000 sponsorship package with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] which brought the championship an overall sponsor for the first time and saw the series promoted as the '''Shell Ultra Australian Touring Car Championship'''.<ref>Graham Howard & Stewart Wilson, Australian Touring Car Championship, 30 fabulous years, 1989, page 290</ref>\n\nShell would also become the major sponsor of DJR which saw the team expand to running two cars for the first time. The team ran a pair of the new [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]]s for team boss [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] and his [[1986 James Hardie 1000]] co-driver [[Gregg Hansford]]. Dick Johnson's win in Round 5 at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] was the world's first race victory for the Sierra RS Cosworth and was also Dick's first ATCC win since Round 4 of the [[1984 Australian Touring Car Championship|1984 ATCC]] at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]].\n\nThe 1987 ATCC was the first time since [[1975 Australian Touring Car Championship|1975]] that [[Peter Brock]] failed to win a round of the championship, his best finish being a 3rd at [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] in [[Tasmania]] in Round 2 where his 4.9L [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A]] was simply out-gunned on a noted power circuit by the [[Roadways Racing]] Commodore of [[Allan Grice]] (before his race ended), the [[Gibson Motorsport|factory]] [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline turbo]] of race winner [[George Fury]], while his heavy Commodore was no match on tyres and brakes for the [[Inline 4|4 cyl]], [[BMW S14|2.3L]] BMW M3 of Jim Richards. Brock did manage to hold second behind runaway early leader Grice for a number of laps, but once Fury was through the Skyline drove away from Brock and he then had no answer to the challenge of Richards.\n\nThe 1987 championship was also the first time since [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]] that a Holden car failed to win a round of the ATCC, the best result being a second by [[Larry Perkins]] in the opening round at Calder.\n\nThe 1987 ATCC was also the first time in championship history that rolling starts were used. Rolling starts were used at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder]] for Round 1 and at Adelaide for Round 5.\n\nJim Richards victory in the final round of the series at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] would be the last time a car powered by a [[naturally aspirated engine]] would win an ATCC race until [[Tony Longhurst]] won Round 6 of the [[1991 Australian Touring Car Championship]] driving a [[BMW M3|BMW M3 Evolution]]. Between 1988 and Round 6 in 1991, turbo powered cars would win 30 straight ATCC races, 21 of them by the Sierra Cosworth's evolution replacement which appeared after the 1987 ATCC, the [[Ford Sierra RS500]].\n\n1987 was a year of lasts in Australian touring car racing. It was the last time Peter Brock would drive a Holden until [[1991 Australian Touring Car season|1991]] as he would switch first to [[BMW]] in [[1988 Australian Touring Car season|1988]] and then [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] in [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989]] and [[1990 Australian Touring Car season|1990]]. Consequently, it was the last time the [[Holden Dealer Team]] name, which started under [[Harry Firth]] in 1969, would be used, though the team officially ran as \"HDT Racing Pty Ltd\" as it was no longer the factory backed team following Holden's well publicised split with Brock in February only one week before the opening round at Calder. Prior to Calder, Holden had formed the Holden Motorsport Group and immediately signed Larry Perkins and [[Perkins Engineering|his team]] as well as Allan Grice and Roadways Racing to be the 'factory backed' teams in the championship, though Grice would later say that it was more about moral support and an easier supply of parts rather than any financial support. It would also be [[Colin Bond]]'s last year of racing [[Alfa Romeo]]'s before switching back to Ford to run a Sierra RS500 from 1988 (largely due to Alfa stopping its development program of the Alfa 75 touring car and because Bond felt that he needed an outright car to do justice to his sponsor [[Caltex]]). It was also the last time the [[JPS Team BMW]] (who won their second title) would be seen with team boss [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] unexpectedly closing the team down at the end of the year.\n\n==Teams and drivers==\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 1987 [[Australian Touring Car Championship]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:

For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[New Hampshire primary]], which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.\n\n===Election issues===\nAccording to exit polls taking during the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucuses]], the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/epolls/IA/index.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)\n# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)\n# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)\n# Education (14% of Respondents)\n\n====Economy====\nDespite being characterized by many as an election on [[Iraq]], the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters' top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In [[Iowa]], of those who cited the [[economy]] as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.\n\nEventual nominee [[John Kerry]], much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.kerry.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.\n\nRunner up [[John Edwards]] ran a position of support for the [[middle class]] as well as [[budget]] caps and enforcement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.edwards.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards's main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in [[South Carolina]]. Another major component of Edwards's message was to be able to reinstate fiscal responsibility.\n\n[[Howard Dean]], despite taking many of the same positions of his rivals including Edwards and Kerry, had a starkly different approach on the issue of Social Security and tax cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.dean.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On taxes, Dean favored repealing the [[Bush Tax cuts]] not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/us/tax-cuts-split-the-democratic-presidential-field.html |title=Tax Cuts Split the Democratic Presidential Field |last=Rosenbaum |first=David E. |date=2003-09-12 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== Iraq War ====\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in [[Iraq]] had now become urgent. Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have possessed, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]].  This\nsituation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]], which Bush called the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\", to invade Iraq.\n\nThe coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003.  Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort.  Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters.  However, speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry said, \"We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Poor | first=Eric | title=Kerry calls for new U.S. leadership |date=2003-04-03 | publisher=Monadnock Ledger | url=http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917004530/http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml | archivedate=2004-09-17}}</ref>  Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickler | first=Nedra | title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Hastert, Delay assail Kerry speech; Edwards chats with Bush; Dean writing a book | date=2003-04-03 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/04/03/national1601EST0726.DTL | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624183241/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F04%2F03%2Fnational1601EST0726.DTL | archivedate=2003-06-24 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, [[George W. Bush]] landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating \"Mission Accomplished\". Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:<ref>{{cite news | last=Bash | first=Dana  | title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |date=2003-10-29 | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/}}\n</ref>) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |date=2003-05-24 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.\n\n=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===\n{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign| John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign| Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign| Wesley Clark 2004 presidential campaign}}\n[[Image:Howard Dean declaration of candidacy June 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy on June 23, 2003, winning the MoveOn \"primary\" days later. His campaign would go on to lead most polls and raise the most money in the latter part of 2003.]]\n\nOn May 31, 2002, [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] formed a presidential exploratory committee.  Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition.  As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.\n\nIn December of that year, [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], announced on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' his plans to form an exploratory committee for a possible 2004 presidential run, anticipating a formal announcement \"down the road some months\".  Kerry's experience as a decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates' suitability in the role of \"commander in chief\".\n\nTwo weeks later, former [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential candidate]] [[Al Gore]] announced on the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.\n\nOther potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore's plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph Lieberman]], Gore's 2000 vice presidential running mate,  had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party's nomination. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run.  Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. [[John Edwards|John R. Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], U.S. Rep. [[Dick Gephardt|Richard A. \"Dick\" Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]], and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from [[Illinois]] [[Carol Moseley Braun]], U.S. Representative from [[Ohio]] [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] of [[Florida]].\n\nThere were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included [[United States Senate]] Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], and former U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]].\n\nIn April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Howard Dean]] aired the first [[television]] advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000.  During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC.  Later that month, liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] held the first ever online Democratic \"primary\", which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value.  Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] received 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%.  Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support.  Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary | work=MoveOn.org | url=http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | accessdate=September 28, 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | archivedate=September 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced.  Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each.  Dean's strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning.  The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniac]]s''.  His campaign's innovative use of the [[Internet]] helped to build a strongly supportive [[grassroots]] constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.\n\nBy autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls.  Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme [[Liberalism|liberal]]; however, in liberal [[Vermont]], Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]] or independent [[Ralph Nader]], charged that, at heart, Dean was a \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\"&mdash;socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/17/politics |title=Howard Dean: 'the flip flop candidate' |last=Raban |first=Jonathan |date=2004-01-17 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Wesley Clark enters ===\nOver the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a [[United States|nationwide]] campaign to \"[[Political draft|draft]]\" retired [[general|four-star general]] [[Wesley Clark]] for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a [[Television commercial|commercial]] by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the \"draft Clark\" groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to\nrun. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): \"My name is Wes Clark.  I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.\"  He said, \"We're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.\"\n\nHis campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign.  They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging [[George W. Bush]] post-[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|September 11]]. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than [[Howard Dean]], who was still the front-runner for the party's nomination.  Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year.  Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in [[Oklahoma]], the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.\n\nCriticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution.  His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short \"sound bite\" answers.\n\n=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===\nThroughout the early campaigning season, the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] appeared to be a two-way contest between former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]]. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]]. In total, Dean spent nearly $40 million in the two states.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1DF1038F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63| title =  THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; IN SHAKE-UP, DEAN NAMES GORE ALLY TO RUN CAMPAIGN | work=The New York Times | first1=Jodi| last1=Wilgoren| first2=Glen| last2=Justice| date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> Gephardt, coming from neighboring Missouri, won the state's caucus in 1988 when he first ran for the party nomination.\n\nHowever, days before the Iowa caucuses were held, negative campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally. This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.\n\nA poll released by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/misc/iowa.recap.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.\n[[File:Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, 2004.svg|thumb|Iowa results by county{{legend|#2A7FFF|John Kerry}}{{legend|#ff7f2a|John Edwards}}{{legend|#00ff66|Howard Dean}}{{legend|#666666|Tie}}\n]]\n<nowiki> </nowiki>After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.\n\nAfter his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race.<ref>{{ cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/19/elec04.prez.gephardt/index.html| title = Gephardt to drop out of race | work=CNN | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results.\n\nIn the [[2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]], Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%.

He finished with 12% in the [[New Hampshire primary]] one week later, essentially tied for third-place position with retired general [[Wesley Clark]]. The following week, Edwards won in [[South Carolina]] and nearly beat Clark in [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004.]]\nAfter Dean's withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Idaho]]. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in [[Wisconsin]] on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: \"Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Many other candidates dropped out during this time, leaving only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.\n\nEdwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in [[New York City]], where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a \"Washington insider\" and by mocking Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.\n\nIn [[Super Tuesday]], March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the [[presumptive nominee]]. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.\n\nOn March 11, after meetings with Democratic [[superdelegate]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], and former [[primary election]] opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The [[Democratic National Committee|DNC's]] website acknowledged him as the party's nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Convention]].\n\n''See also the [[John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign]]''\n\n=== Nomination ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KerryatDNC.jpg|thumb|238px|Kerry gave a salute and proclaimed, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 19 August 2008}}]] -->\n{{details|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nOn July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], held later that month.  Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention.  The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Working Families Party]].\n\n[[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Lottie Shackelford]],  served as vice chairman.  Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured [[keynote speech]] of [[Barack Obama]], a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] native and candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s opening night speech and the confirmation of the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|nomination]] of [[John Kerry]] as the candidate for president and of [[John Edwards]] as the candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].  Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience a prominent theme.  In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"\n\nKerry and Edwards faced incumbents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]].  Following his official nomination at the Convention, Kerry received only a small [[convention bounce|bounce]] in the polls and remained \"neck and neck\" with Bush.  This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inskeep |first1=Steve |title=Polls: Kerry Got Little Bounce from Boston |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3809479 |website=NPR |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry.  The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].  Bush defended the actions of his administration, while Kerry contended that the war had been fought incompetently, and that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] was a distraction from the War on Terror, not a part of it.\n\n== Overview ==\n{| style=\"margin:auto\"\n|{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:25 right:10 left:10\nAlignBars =

For most of 2003, Howard Dean had been the apparent front-runner for the nomination, performing strongly in most polls and leading the pack in fund-raising. However, Kerry won the [[Iowa caucus]]es and [[New Hampshire primary]], which gave him enough momentum to carry the majority of the rest of the states.\n\n===Election issues===\nAccording to exit polls taking during the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa Caucuses]], the top 4 issues were ranked as follows:<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/epolls/IA/index.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n# Economy/Jobs (29% of Respondents)\n# Health Care/Medicine (28% of Respondents)\n# The war in Iraq (14% of Respondents)\n# Education (14% of Respondents)\n\n====Economy====\nDespite being characterized by many as an election on [[Iraq]], the economy and jobs were repeatedly cited as voters' top or one of top three concerns during the course of the primary season. In [[Iowa]], of those who cited the [[economy]] as their most important issue, 34% supported Kerry, while 33% supported Edwards, with Dean trailing at 16% and Gephardt at 12%.\n\nEventual nominee [[John Kerry]], much like other Democrats adopted policy stances of tax-cuts for the middle class, increased spending for Social Security, and assisting small businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.kerry.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On the aspect of job creation, Kerry strongly supported the creation and safety of infrastructure-related jobs, like those in the railroad industry. During the course of the primary Kerry continued to advocate positions such as fiscal responsibility and end state fiscal crises by giving states increased fiscal aid.\n\nRunner up [[John Edwards]] ran a position of support for the [[middle class]] as well as [[budget]] caps and enforcement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.edwards.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Strongly opposing Social Security privatization, and interested in middle class tax cuts, Edwards's main economic theme was support for the middle class touting his own struggle, growing up the son of a poor mill worker in [[South Carolina]]. Another major component of Edwards's message was to be able to reinstate fiscal responsibility.\n\n[[Howard Dean]], despite taking many of the same positions of his rivals including Edwards and Kerry, had a starkly different approach on the issue of Social Security and tax cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/issues/index.dean.html| title = CNN.com Specials | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> On taxes, Dean favored repealing the [[Bush Tax cuts]] not only for the wealthiest of Americans as Senator Edwards and Senator Kerry proposed, but for all, including middle and lower classes.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/12/us/tax-cuts-split-the-democratic-presidential-field.html |title=Tax Cuts Split the Democratic Presidential Field |last=Rosenbaum |first=David E. |date=2003-09-12 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==== Iraq War ====\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the need to remove [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in [[Iraq]] had now become urgent. Over the course of several months, Bush presented several premises for war, but the turning point was that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons|biological]] and [[chemical weapons|chemical]] material it was known to have possessed, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]].  This\nsituation escalated to the point that the United States assembled a group of about forty nations, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]], which Bush called the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\", to invade Iraq.\n\nThe coalition invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003.  Most contenders for the nomination were supportive of the effort.  Only Dean and Kucinich firmly questioned the aims and tactics of the administration, setting themselves apart in the eyes of war protesters.  However, speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry said, \"We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Poor | first=Eric | title=Kerry calls for new U.S. leadership |date=2003-04-03 | publisher=Monadnock Ledger | url=http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040917004530/http://www.mledger.com/2003/archives/1_news_040303.shtml | archivedate=2004-09-17}}</ref>  Republicans criticized Kerry for speaking out against a wartime president.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pickler | first=Nedra | title=POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: Hastert, Delay assail Kerry speech; Edwards chats with Bush; Dean writing a book | date=2003-04-03 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/04/03/national1601EST0726.DTL | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030624183241/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F2003%2F04%2F03%2Fnational1601EST0726.DTL | archivedate=2003-06-24 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe invasion was swift, with the collapse of the Iraq government and the [[military of Iraq]] in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly secured with limited damage in that time. On May 1, [[George W. Bush]] landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating \"Mission Accomplished\". Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as being overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:<ref>{{cite news | last=Bash | first=Dana  | title=White House pressed on 'mission accomplished' sign |date=2003-10-29 | publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/}}\n</ref>) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, was criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rode at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.<ref>{{cite news | title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |date=2003-05-24 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml | work=CBS News}}</ref>\n\nOn May 3, 2003, Democrats met at the [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the nomination. The candidates disagreed on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but united in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.\n\n=== Dean emerges as front-runner ===\n{{main|John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign| John Edwards 2004 presidential campaign| Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign| Wesley Clark 2004 presidential campaign}}\n[[Image:Howard Dean declaration of candidacy June 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Howard Dean declared his candidacy on June 23, 2003, winning the MoveOn \"primary\" days later.

Though this was almost two years before the Iowa Caucus, Dean hoped the early start would give him some much needed name recognition.  As a governor of a small state, Dean was not well known outside of New England.\n\nIn December of that year, [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], announced on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'' his plans to form an exploratory committee for a possible 2004 presidential run, anticipating a formal announcement \"down the road some months\".  Kerry's experience as a decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran generated some excitement among Democrats tired of being on the defensive about their candidates' suitability in the role of \"commander in chief\".\n\nTwo weeks later, former [[Vice President of the United States of America|Vice President]] and [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential candidate]] [[Al Gore]] announced on the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that he would not seek election to the presidency in 2004. Gore had recently wrapped up a nationwide book tour and had been widely expected to run.\n\nOther potential candidates were likely waiting to see what Gore's plans were, and thus the floodgates opened in January 2003. Senator [[Joe Lieberman|Joseph Lieberman]], Gore's 2000 vice presidential running mate,  had previously promised not to run should Gore seek their party's nomination. Freed from that obligation, Lieberman announced his intention to run.  Additionally, many other candidates announced their intention to form committees (a formality usually indicating an official run): U.S. Sen. [[John Edwards|John R. Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]], U.S. Rep. [[Dick Gephardt|Richard A. \"Dick\" Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]], and Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].  In February, more candidates announced their intentions: former Senator from [[Illinois]] [[Carol Moseley Braun]], U.S. Representative from [[Ohio]] [[Dennis Kucinich]], and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Graham]] of [[Florida]].\n\nThere were other potential candidates for whom some speculation was buzzing about a potential run. These candidates felt it necessary to officially state that they would not seek the party nomination. These included [[United States Senate]] Minority Leader [[Tom Daschle]], U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]] of [[Connecticut]], and former U.S. Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]].\n\nIn April, Democratic fund-raising totals for the first quarter of 2003 were reported. John Edwards raised $7.4 million, John Kerry raised $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raised $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raised $3.0 million, Howard Dean raised $2.6 million, Bob Graham raised $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raised less than $1 million each.\n\nIn June 2003, [[Howard Dean]] aired the first [[television]] advertising of the 2004 campaign, spending more than $300,000.  During that time, he formally announced his run for president, filing to form a presidential election campaign with the FEC.  Later that month, liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] held the first ever online Democratic \"primary\", which lasted just over 48 hours. It was an unofficial and nonbinding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value.  Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] received 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%.  Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support.  Instead, MoveOn supported all the candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title=Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary | work=MoveOn.org | url=http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | accessdate=September 28, 2005 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html | archivedate=September 29, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn July, the Democratic fund-raising numbers for the second quarter of 2003 were reported and announced.  Howard Dean surprised many raising $7.5 million, John Kerry raised $6 million, while John Edwards and Joseph Lieberman raised roughly $5 million each.  Dean's strength as a fund-raiser was attributed mainly to his innovative embrace of the Internet for campaigning.  The majority of his donations came from individual Dean supporters, who came to be known as ''Deanites'', or, more commonly, ''[[Deaniac]]s''.  His campaign's innovative use of the [[Internet]] helped to build a strongly supportive [[grassroots]] constituency, much of which remained intensely loyal to him long after the end of his candidacy.\n\nBy autumn of 2003, Dean had become the apparent front-runner for the Democratic nomination, performing strongly in most polls.  Generally regarded as a pragmatic [[centrist]] during his time as governor, Dean emerged during his presidential campaign as something of a [[populism|populist]], denouncing the policies of the Bush administration (especially the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]) as well as fellow Democrats, who, in his view, failed to strongly oppose them.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, critics on the right labeled Dean's political views as those of an extreme [[Liberalism|liberal]]; however, in liberal [[Vermont]], Dean, long known as a staunch advocate of fiscal restraint, was regarded as a moderate. Many critics on the left, who supported fellow Democrat [[Dennis Kucinich]] or independent [[Ralph Nader]], charged that, at heart, Dean was a \"[[Rockefeller Republican]]\"&mdash;socially liberal, while fiscally conservative.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/17/politics |title=Howard Dean: 'the flip flop candidate' |last=Raban |first=Jonathan |date=2004-01-17 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2017-12-09 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Wesley Clark enters ===\nOver the summer of 2003, several organized groups began a [[United States|nationwide]] campaign to \"[[Political draft|draft]]\" retired [[general|four-star general]] [[Wesley Clark]] for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2004 presidential election. CNN on August 13 showed a [[Television commercial|commercial]] by one of these groups and interviewed Clark. He disavowed any connection with the \"draft Clark\" groups, but said he had been considering his position and that within a few weeks he would likely make public his decision on whether to\nrun. He also fueled speculation with a television interview in which he first declared himself a Democrat.\n\nOn September 17, 2003, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark announced his intention to run in the [[U.S. Democratic Party Presidential Primary, 2004|presidential primary election]] for the Democratic Party nomination, becoming the tenth and last Democrat to do so (coming many months after the others): \"My name is Wes Clark.  I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, and I am here to announce that I intend to seek the presidency of the United States of America.\"  He said, \"We're going to run a campaign that will move this country forward, not back.\"\n\nHis campaign focused on themes of leadership and patriotism; early campaign ads relied heavily on biography. His late start left him with relatively few detailed policy proposals. This weakness was apparent in his first few debates, although he soon presented a range of position papers, including a major tax-relief plan. Nevertheless, many Democrats flocked to his campaign.  They were drawn by his military background, and saw such foreign policy credentials as a valuable asset in challenging [[George W. Bush]] post-[[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|September 11]]. Advisors and supporters portrayed him as more electable than [[Howard Dean]], who was still the front-runner for the party's nomination.  Despite the burst of enthusiasm for Clark in late 2003, Dean maintained a strong lead in the polls for the latter half of the year.  Clark won the Democratic Presidential Primary in [[Oklahoma]], the only state carried by Clark in the primary election.\n\nCriticism of Clark began almost the moment he entered the race. Originally heralded as an antiwar general, he stumbled in the first few days of his candidacy. He was perceived as changing his answer on how he would have voted on the Iraq war resolution.  His supporters argued that his perceived indecision was due to lack of experience with the media and their insistence on short \"sound bite\" answers.\n\n=== Iowa and New Hampshire ===\nThroughout the early campaigning season, the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] appeared to be a two-way contest between former [[Vermont]] Governor [[Howard Dean]] and [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Richard Gephardt]]. Dean, the national front runner, had been able to pour money into [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]]. In total, Dean spent nearly $40 million in the two states.<ref>{{Cite news| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E1DF1038F93AA15752C0A9629C8B63| title =  THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE FORMER GOVERNOR; IN SHAKE-UP, DEAN NAMES GORE ALLY TO RUN CAMPAIGN | work=The New York Times | first1=Jodi| last1=Wilgoren| first2=Glen| last2=Justice| date=January 29, 2004}}</ref> Gephardt, coming from neighboring Missouri, won the state's caucus in 1988 when he first ran for the party nomination.\n\nHowever, days before the Iowa caucuses were held, negative campaigning by Dean and Gephardt took a late toll on the two campaigns in Iowa as well as nationally. This, along with the resurgence of John Kerry and the emergence of John Edwards as major contenders in Iowa, put the Gephardt and Dean campaigns on edge.\n\nA poll released by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' days before the caucus was held showed Dean and Gephardt had lost all of their lead in Iowa. In the poll, Kerry led with 26% of those surveyed, Edwards came in second with 23%, Dean came in third with 20%, and Gephardt came in fourth with 18%.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/primaries/pages/misc/iowa.recap.html| title = CNN.com 2004 Primaries | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn caucus night, as results were being tallied, it became evident that Kerry and Edwards were in a battle for first and Dean and Gephardt were in a battle for third.\n[[File:Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, 2004.svg|thumb|Iowa results by county{{legend|#2A7FFF|John Kerry}}{{legend|#ff7f2a|John Edwards}}{{legend|#00ff66|Howard Dean}}{{legend|#666666|Tie}}\n]]\n<nowiki> </nowiki>After all votes were tallied, John Kerry received 38% of the delegates, John Edwards received 32%, Howard Dean received 18%, and Richard Gephardt received 11%.\n\nAfter his poor showing, Gephardt dropped out of the race.<ref>{{ cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/19/elec04.prez.gephardt/index.html| title = Gephardt to drop out of race | work=CNN | date=January 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Kerry and Edwards claimed newfound momentum, while Dean attempted to downplay the results.\n\nIn the [[2004 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]], Kerry was able to defeat Howard Dean once again, beating him 38%-26%.

He finished with 12% in the [[New Hampshire primary]] one week later, essentially tied for third-place position with retired general [[Wesley Clark]]. The following week, Edwards won in [[South Carolina]] and nearly beat Clark in [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:John-Edwards-Shakes-Hands.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Edwards on the campaign trail in 2004.]]\nAfter Dean's withdrawal from the contest, Edwards became the only major challenger to Kerry for the nomination. However, Kerry continued to dominate, taking in wins in [[Michigan]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Maine]], [[Tennessee]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Nevada]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Utah]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Idaho]]. Remarking on an unexpectedly strong finish in [[Wisconsin]] on February 17, Edwards humorously cautioned Kerry: \"Objects in your mirror may be closer than they appear.\" Many other candidates dropped out during this time, leaving only Kerry, Edwards, Sharpton and Kucinich in the running. Dean, while not officially running, did not release his delegates, and still put in a strong showing considering that he was no longer mounting an official campaign.\n\nEdwards maintained a positive campaign and largely avoided attacking Kerry until a February 29, 2004, debate in [[New York City]], where he attempted to put Kerry on the defensive by characterizing the front-runner as a \"Washington insider\" and by mocking Kerry's plan to form a committee to examine trade agreements.\n\nIn [[Super Tuesday]], March 2, Kerry won decisive victories in the [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], and [[Rhode Island]] primaries and the [[Minnesota]] caucuses. Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia but, failing to win a single state, chose to withdraw, making Kerry the [[presumptive nominee]]. President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] called Senator Kerry to congratulate him that evening.\n\nOn March 11, after meetings with Democratic [[superdelegate]]s in [[Washington, D.C.]], and former [[primary election]] opponents, Kerry accumulated the 2,162 delegates required to clinch the nomination. The [[Democratic National Committee|DNC's]] website acknowledged him as the party's nominee at that time, four and a half months prior to the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Convention]].\n\n''See also the [[John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign]]''\n\n=== Nomination ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KerryatDNC.jpg|thumb|238px|Kerry gave a salute and proclaimed, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 19 August 2008}}]] -->\n{{details|2004 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nOn July 6, John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate shortly before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], held later that month.  Senators Kerry and Edwards were formally nominated by the Democratic Party at the convention.  The Kerry/Edwards ticket was on the ballot in all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.  In [[New York (state)|New York]], the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the [[Working Families Party]].\n\n[[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico Governor]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] served as chairman of the convention while former presidential advisor to [[Bill Clinton]], [[Lottie Shackelford]],  served as vice chairman.  Defining moments of the 2004 Democratic National Convention included the featured [[keynote speech]] of [[Barack Obama]], a [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] native and candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Illinois]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s opening night speech and the confirmation of the [[Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004|nomination]] of [[John Kerry]] as the candidate for president and of [[John Edwards]] as the candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].  Kerry made his [[Vietnam War]] experience a prominent theme.  In accepting the nomination, he began his speech with \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty.\"\n\nKerry and Edwards faced incumbents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election|2004 presidential election]].  Following his official nomination at the Convention, Kerry received only a small [[convention bounce|bounce]] in the polls and remained \"neck and neck\" with Bush.  This was the first time in recent political history that a candidate failed to receive a substantial boost in post-convention poll numbers. Some political pundits attributed this small boost to the unusually small number of undecided voters as compared with previous presidential elections.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inskeep |first1=Steve |title=Polls: Kerry Got Little Bounce from Boston |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3809479 |website=NPR |accessdate=28 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe general election was won by Bush, who defeated Kerry.  The election was fought primarily on the issue of the conduct of the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]].  Bush defended the actions of his administration, while Kerry contended that the war had been fought incompetently, and that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]] was a distraction from the War on Terror, not a part of it.\n\n== Overview ==\n{| style=\"margin:auto\"\n|{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:25 right:10 left:10\nAlignBars =

Her sarcastic attitude gets her into trouble from time to time. Amy's surname, Gumm, is an homage to [[Judy Garland]], who portrayed Dorothy in the 1939 movie ''[[Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]''. Garland's real name was Frances Ethel Gumm.\n* '''Madison Pendleton''': A girl who has bullied Amy since elementary school and is now pregnant by her boyfriend, whom Amy allows to cheat off her homework.

She is bullied at school for her snarky demeanor, and is [[child neglect|neglected]] by her substance-abusing mother. After her mother leaves to go to a party, Amy's trailer is caught in a [[tornado]]  and transported to the [[Land of Oz]], but is trapped in a canyon. She is rescued by a mysterious boy named Pete who tells her to go to the [[Emerald City]]. Amy, accompanied by her mother's pet rat, Star, and a punk Goth [[Munchkin]] named Indigo, learns Oz has been conquered by [[Dorothy Gale]], now a power-hungry, self-proclaimed princess and dictator. Rescuing a [[crucifixion|crucified]] wingless flying monkey, Ollie, Amy encounters the [[Tin Woodman]], Dorothy's grand inquisitor and protector, who arrests her and kills Indigo. Ollie flees and abandons them.\n\nAmy reunites with Pete, who claims to be a gardener in the royal palace and tells her she will be rescued. On the night of her \"fate worse than death\", Amy is rescued by [[Mombi]], a member of a [[secret society]] called the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked, who wish to free Oz from Dorothy's control. The group includes Mombi, [[Good Witch of the North|Grandma Gert]], [[Glinda]]'s twin sister Glamora, and several teenage warriors including a [[warlock]] named Nox who wishes to avenge his family and friends. The Order reveals they recruited Amy to train her in magic and then assassinate Dorothy. Amy agrees and is taught how to use magic by Gert, armed with an enchanted dagger (which Nox made her). The Order attempts to eliminate the [[Cowardly Lion]], now a ravenous monster who absorbs the fear of others, but the attack fails, leading to Gert's death.\n\nThe Order move on with their main plan, magically disguising Amy as a maid in the royal palace. They inform her an unnamed agent of theirs will be watching her. Amy, under the alias of Astrid, encounters the delusional [[Princess Ozma]], and learns the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]] himself has returned to Oz. Amy also encounters Ollie, who has sneaked into the palace to rescue his sister Maude from the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], who has become a [[mad scientist]] and performs inhuman experiments on Ozians. Amy breaks into the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]]'s underground laboratory and rescues Maude, but has to saw off her wings to prevent Dorothy from controlling her. Ollie and Maude flee. The next day, the Tin Woodman searches for the culprit, and [[Jellia Jamb]], Dorothy's handmaid, takes the blame, revealing herself to be Amy's backup. Jellia tries to assassinate Dorothy, but is maimed by the Lion.\n\nA large gala is held in the palace. Amy, working as a waitress still under the disguise of Astrid, discovers the Scarecrow has turned Jellia into a [[zombie]] servant. Amy reunites with Nox, who at this point is in disguise as well, and uses the Tin Woodman as a distraction to take Dorothy to her chamber, where she attempts the assassination; but she is thwarted by [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] and the Tin Woodman. As the Order storm the palace, Amy tackles Dorothy over a balcony, but the latter teleports herself safely away using her [[ruby slippers]]. Amy is rescued by Ollie and Maude, using makeshift wings, and taken to Pete and the Wizard, who tells her a way to defeat Dorothy is to slay her companions and bring him the brain, heart, and courage he bestowed upon them. The Tin Woodman appears; Amy slays the Woodman, taking his heart before flying away to safety with the monkeys, accompanied by Ozma, who reveals that she is Pete's true identity.\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''Amy Gumm''': The story's protagonist.
