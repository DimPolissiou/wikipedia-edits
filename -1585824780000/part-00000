She had previously claimed that her father was Ukrainian, and her mother was Irish.\n\n==''The Hand that Signed the Paper'': Novel and controversy==\n\n===Contents===\nDarville's debut novel, ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'', tells the story of a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. The family comprises the parents, a daughter, and two sons. They suffer abuse by the drunken local commissar and are refused treatment by the village doctor and his wife (a secular Jew). Many Ukrainians hail the German invaders as liberators from Soviet oppression. Many volunteered for the German armed forces&mdash;[[Wehrmacht]], [[SS]], and [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The novel stresses the arbitrariness of the assignments to military units. A Ukrainian could as easily end up fighting on the front alongside the Wehrmacht as be in a death squad.\n\nThe two young brothers are separated in military assignments: 16-year-old Evheny to [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Einsatzgruppen]] C (a mobile killing squad) and the elder 19-year-old Vitaly to the SS training facility for Ukrainians at [[Trawniki]] in Poland. Evheny is implicated in the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] outside Kiev, while Vitaly is posted to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] as a guard. Evheny is later sent to a front-line [[Waffen SS]] formation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], while Vitaly is posted to northern Italy. He is part of German anti-partisan activity in the wake of Italy's withdrawal from the Axis alliance.\n\n===Style===\nThe novel is told primarily from the point of view of Kateryna, sister of the two brothers, and Magda, Vitaly's [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] from the Polish village near the Treblinka extermination camp. Kateryna has a relationship with a German SS [[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]. Magda assists a Jewish prisoner to escape after the Treblinka prisoner revolt in August 1943. The family's story is gradually revealed by Fiona, Evheny's Australian-born daughter, who starts investigating the past after her uncle Vitaly is charged in the early 1990s with war crimes in World War II.\n\nThe novel was frank about the anti-semitism of its major characters (who blame Jews for the excesses of Communism), and Darville represented the lives of Ukrainian military men in a sympathetic manner, rather than featuring their victims as is more usual in Holocaust literature. These elements attracted accusations of anti-semitism and condemnation of the book by leaders of Australia's Jewish community. There was a perception that the attitudes of the author \"Helen Demidenko\" may have been informed by her Ukrainian ethnic identity, until her [[pseudonym]] was revealed along with her false representation of the book as history.\n\n===Controversy===\nThe novel won the [[Miles Franklin Award]], one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia.

It was developed in association with the [[Office of Fair Trading]], as well as the [[Information Commissioner|Information Commissioner's Office]],  who continue to this day to take an active interest in the development of Cifas.\n\nCifas is today run by a board of directors, that includes both independent directors who are not directly involved in the day-to-day running of the organisation, and the Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer, who are. From 1988 to 2016  the majority of the directors were elected by participating organisations. They now participate in the governance of the organisation through an \"Advisory Board\".\n\n==Fraud databases==\nCifas' National Fraud Database allows participating organisations to exchange details of applications for products or services which are considered to be fraudulent, inconsistent or suspicious; exchange information about accounts and services which are being misused; and information about insurance and other claims that are considered to be fraudulent, inconsistent or suspicious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cifas.org.uk/nfd|title=Cifas - National Fraud Database|date=25 November 2010|website=www.cifas.org.uk|publisher=Cifas|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n\nOrganisations can also exchange information about innocent victims of fraud to protect them from further fraud. \n\nThe Internal Fraud Database allows participating organisations to exchange details of cases where an applicant or member of staff has acted fraudulently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cifas.org.uk/ifd|title=Cifas - Internal Fraud Database|date=25 November 2010|website=www.cifas.org.uk|publisher=Cifas|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]], an individual has the right to make a [[Subject access request|Subject Access Request]] to Cifas, who will, in accordance with the Act and its exemptions, disclose data held on the individual where the law permits it. Cifas is not a [[Credit reference agency|Credit Reference Agency]] but is the Data Controller for Cifas data and responsible for its accuracy.\n\n== Complaints ==\nAll warnings used to be examined by specialist fraud staff in participating organisations but automated systems may now be used to refuse a product or service without any investigation of a warning. Cifas says: \"The ability to make automated decisions allows members to immediately decline facilities to subjects who are deemed an immediate fraud risk. This is another massive step forward in utilising the data from Cifas, freeing up resource from reviewing referrals that have already been deemed a high fraud risk.\" (https://www.cifas.org.uk/insight/fraud-risk-focus-blog/how-updated-principles-using-cifas-national-fraud-database-help-its-members)\n\nConsumers who are disadvantaged by this change in practice, may complain to the Information Commissioner and seek financial compensation from both Cifas and the responsible organisations who supplied and used the information.

It has a high turnover of staff and has a reputation for regular re-organisations that result in redundancies.\n\n== Collaborations and partnerships ==\nCifas works with fraud prevention, financial, public sector, academic and charitable organisations and law enforcement to raise awareness of fraud and promote best practice in fraud prevention.

{"title_page": "Mbabaram people", "text_new": "{{use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n'''Mbabaram''' or '''Mbabaram''', often referred to as the '''Barbaram people''', are an [[Indigenous Australian]] people living in Queensland on the rainforests of the [[Atherton Tableland]].\n\n==Language==\nFor a long time mystery surrounded the [[Mbabaram language]]. The little that was known of it hinted that it might be a [[language isolate]], since it appeared to differ notably from the surrounding languages. In particular its vocabulary was monosyllabic, an anomaly among Australian aboriginal languages. This puzzle contributed to the Barrinean hypothesis, which regarded the Mbabaram people as a reclusive rainforest remnant of an original Negrito population. The mystery was solved, when, taking a hint from a suggestion from [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]], [[Robert M. W. Dixon]] discovered that the ostensible differences could be accounted for by noting that Mbabaram words dropped the initial syllable present in contiguous languages, and had developed from a regular Australian language.{{sfn|Dixon|1980|p=262}} A phonetic principle outlined by Hale laid down that a second syllable of a Mbabaram word would become ''o'' if the original word began with a ''g''. Thus an original ''guwa'' (west) would change in Mbabaram to ''wo'', which was indeed their word for 'west'. The word for 'dog' is also in Mbabaram the monosyllabic 'dog', not borrowed from English but, following this rule simply a clipped version of ''gudaga'', the word for the animal in [[Yidin language|Yidin]], which exists also in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], though there shortened to ''guda''.{{sfn|Dixon|2011|p=129}} With this insight, Mbabaram suddenly appeared no longer aberrant, but perfectly regular as an Australian language.{{efn|\"I now saw that Mbabaram was unique, among languages of this region, in having lost the first syllable from most of its words and having developed new vowels. All of the languages surrounding it had conserved disyllabic forms, similar to those found over most of the continent.\"{{sfn|Dixon|2011|p=146}}}}\n\n==Country==\n[[File:Traditional lands of the Australian aboriginal tribes around Cairns.png|thumb|Right|[[Traditional lands]] of the [[Australian aboriginal]] tribes around Cairns.]]\nThe Mbarabam people's traditional territory is on the [[Atherton Tableland]], was bounded by the [[Kuku Yalanji]], near [[Dimbulah, Queensland|Dimbulah]] to the north, almost to [[Mareeba]], the [[Dyirbal people]] to the [[east]] and the down to [[Irvinebank]] and the [[Warrongo people|Warungu]] tribal lands to their south.

The little that was known of it hinted that it might be a [[language isolate]], since it appeared to differ notably from the surrounding languages. In particular its vocabulary was monosyllabic, an anomaly among Australian aboriginal languages. This puzzle contributed to the Barrinean hypothesis, which regarded the Mbabaram people as a reclusive rainforest remnant of an original Negrito population. The mystery was solved, when, taking a hint from a suggestion from [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]], [[Robert M. W. Dixon]] discovered that the ostensible differences could be accounted for by noting that Mbabaram words dropped the initial syllable present in contiguous languages, and had developed from a regular Australian language.{{sfn|Dixon|1980|p=262}} A phonetic principle outlined by Hale laid down that a second syllable of a Mbabaram word would become ''o'' if the original word began with a ''g''. Thus an original ''guwa'' (west) would change in Mbabaram to ''wo'', which was indeed their word for 'west'. The word for 'dog' is also in Mbabaram the monosyllabic 'dog', not borrowed from English but, following this rule simply a clipped version of ''gudaga'', the word for the animal in [[Yidin language|Yidin]], which exists also in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], though there shortened to ''guda''.{{sfn|Dixon|2011|p=129}} With this insight, Mbabaram suddenly appeared no longer aberrant, but perfectly regular as an Australian language.{{efn|\"I now saw that Mbabaram was unique, among languages of this region, in having lost the first syllable from most of its words and having developed new vowels. All of the languages surrounding it had conserved disyllabic forms, similar to those found over most of the continent.\"{{sfn|Dixon|2011|p=146}}}}\n\n==Country==\n[[File:Traditional lands of the Australian aboriginal tribes around Cairns.png|thumb|Right|[[Traditional lands]] of the [[Australian aboriginal]] tribes around Cairns.]]\nThe Mbarabam people's traditional territory is on the [[Atherton Tableland]], was bounded by the [[Kuku Yalanji]], near [[Dimbulah, Queensland|Dimbulah]] to the north, almost to [[Mareeba]], the [[Dyirbal people]] to the [[east]] and the down to [[Irvinebank]] and the [[Warrongo people|Warungu]] tribal lands to their south.

It is a member of the small [[Dyirbalic languages|Dyirbalic]] branch of the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages|Pama\u2013Nyungan family]]. It possesses many outstanding features that have made it well known among [[linguistics|linguist]]s.\n\nIn the years since the Dyirbal grammar by [[Robert M. W. Dixon|Robert Dixon]] was published in 1972, Dyirbal has steadily moved closer to [[language death|extinction]] as younger community members have failed to learn it.<ref>Schmidt, A: \"Young People's Dyirbal: An Example of Language Death from Australia\" (Cambridge University Press, 1985)</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nDyirbal dialects of the [[Mamu]] people are Wa\u027dibara, Dulgubara, Bagi\u027dgabara, Dyi\u027dibara, Mandubara.\n\n==Phonology==\n\nDyirbal has only four [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] for the [[stop consonant|stop]] and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], whereas most other Australian Aboriginal languages have six. This is because Dyirbal lacks the [[Dental consonant|dental]]/[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]/[[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] split typically found in these languages. Like the majority of Australian languages, it does not make a distinction between voiced consonants (such as b, d, g, etc.) and voiceless consonants (the corresponding p, t, and k, etc. respectively). Like [[Pinyin]], standard Dyirbal [[orthography]] uses voiced consonants, which seem to be preferred by speakers of most Australian languages since the sounds (which can often be semi-voiced) are closer to English semi-voiced ''b, d, g'' than aspirated ''p, t, k''.\n\nThe Dyirbal [[vowel]] system is typical of Australia, with three vowels: {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, though {{IPA|/u/}} is realised as {{IPA|[o]}} in certain environments and {{IPA|/a/}} can be realised as {{IPA|[e]}}, also depending on the environment in which the [[phoneme]] appears.{{elucidate|If we know which environments these are, we should give them.|date=February 2015}} Thus the actual inventory of sounds is greater than the inventory of phonemes would suggest. Stress always falls on the first syllable of a word and usually on subsequent odd-numbered syllables except the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]], which is always unstressed. The result of this is that consecutive stressed syllables do not occur.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2| [[Peripheral consonant|Peripheral]]\n!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|w}}||{{IPA|j}}||{{IPA|l}}\n|\u027b\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe language is best known for its system of [[noun class]]es, numbering four in total. They tend to be divided among the following [[semantic]] lines:\n\n* I \u2013 most animate objects, men\n* II \u2013 women, [[water]], [[fire]], [[violence]], and exceptional [[animal]]s<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=George Lakoff |last=Lakoff |first=George |year=1990 |title=[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=5 }}</ref>\n* III \u2013 edible [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s\n* IV \u2013 miscellaneous (includes things not classifiable in the first three)\n\nThe class usually labelled \"feminine\" (II) inspired the title of [[George Lakoff]]'s book ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''. Some [[Linguistics|linguists]] distinguish between such systems of classification and the [[grammatical gender|gendered division]] of items into the categories of \"feminine\", \"masculine\" and (sometimes) \"neuter\" that is found in, for example, many [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nDyirbal shows a [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] system. Sentences with a first or second person pronoun have their [[verb argument]]s marked for [[Case (linguistics)|case]] in a pattern that mimics [[nominative\u2013accusative language]]s. That is, the first or second person pronoun appears in the least marked case when it is the subject (regardless of the [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] of the verb), and in the most marked case when it is the direct object. Thus Dyirbal is [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] accusative in the first and second persons, but morphologically ergative elsewhere; and it is still always [[syntax|syntactically]] ergative.\n\n==Taboo==\nThere used to be in place a highly complex ''[[taboo]]'' system in Dyirbal culture. A speaker was completely forbidden from speaking with his/her mother-in-law, child-in-law, father's sister's child or mother's brother's child, and from approaching or looking directly at these people.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1972). The Dyirbal language of north Queensland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> A person is forbidden from speaking with their [[cross-cousin]] of the opposite sex due to the fact that those relatives are of the section from which an individual must marry, but are too close of kin to choose as a spouse so the avoidance might be present on the grounds of indicating who is sexually unavailable.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/>\n\nFurthermore, because marriage typically takes place a generation above or below, the cross-cousin of the opposite sex often is a potential mother-in-law or father-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1989\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1989). The Dyirbal kinship system. Oceania , 59(4), 245\u2013268.</ref> In addition, when within hearing range of taboo relatives a person was required to use a specialized and complex form of the language with essentially the same [[phonemes]] and [[grammar]], but with a [[lexicon]] that shared no words with the non-taboo language except for four lexical items referring to grandparents on the mother and father's side.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1990\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1990). The origin of \"mother-in-law vocabulary\" in two Australian languages. Anthropological Linguistics , 32(1/2), 1\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe taboo relationship is reciprocal. Thus, an individual is not allowed to speak with one's own mother-in-law and it is equally taboo for the mother-in-law to speak with her son-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> This relationship is also prevalent among both genders such that a daughter-in-law is forbidden to speak to directly or approach her father-in-law and vice versa.  This taboo exists, although it is not as strongly enforced, between members of the same sex such that a male individual should use the respectful style of speech in the presence of his father-in-law, but the father-in-law can decide whether or not to use the everyday style of speech or the respectful style in the presence of his son-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/>\n\nThe specialized and complex form of the language is known as the Dyal\u014buy and is used in the presence of the taboo relatives whereas a form referred to in most dialects as Guwal is used in all other circumstances.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> The Dyal\u014buy has one fourth of the amount of lexical items as the everyday language which reduces the semantic content in actual communication in the presence of a taboo relative.<ref>Silverstein, M. (1976). Shifters, linguistic categories, and cultural description. In K. H. Basso & H. A. Selby (Eds.), Meaning in Anthropology (pp. 11\u201355). Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.</ref> For example, in Dyal\u014buy the verb 'to ask' is [ba\u014barrmba-l]. In Guwal, 'to ask' is [\u014banba-l], 'to invite someone over' is [yumba-l], 'to invite someone to accompany one' is [bunma-l] and 'to keep asking after having already been told' is [gunji-y]. There are no correspondences to the other 3 verbs of Guwal in Dyal\u014buy.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1990\"/>\n\nTo get around this limitation, Dyirbal speakers use many syntactic and semantic tricks to make do with a minimal vocabulary which reveals a lot to linguists about the semantic nature of Dyirbal. For example, Guwal makes use of lexical [[causative]]s, such as transitive ''bana-'' \"break\" and intransitive ''gaynyja-'' \"break\" (similar to English ''be dead/kill'', ''lie/lay''). Since Dyirbal has fewer lexemes, a morpheme ''-rri-'' is used as an intransitive derivational suffix. Thus the Dyal\u014bguy equivalents of the two words above are transitive ''yuwa'' and intransitive ''yuwa-rri-''.<ref>Dixon, R.M.W. (2000). \"A Typology of Causatives: Form, Syntax, and Meaning\". In Dixon, R.M.W. & Aikhenvald, Alexendra Y. Changing Valency: Case Studies in Transitivity. Cambridge University Press. pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe lexical items found in Dyal\u014buy are mainly derived from three sources: \"borrowings from the everyday register of neighboring dialects or languages, the creation of new [Dyal\u014buy] forms by phonological deformation of lexemes from the language's own everyday style, and the borrowing of terms that were already in the [Dyal\u014buy] style of a neighboring language or dialect\".<ref>Evans, N. (2003). Context, culture, and structuration in the languages of Australia. Annual Review of Anthropology, 32, 13\u201340.</ref>\n\nAn example of borrowing between dialects is the word for sun in the Yidin and Ngadyan dialects. In Yidin, the Guwal style word for sun is [bu\u014ban], and this same word is also the Dyal\u014buy style of the word for sun in the Ngadyan dialect.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> It is hypothesized that children of Dyirbal tribes were expected to acquire the Dyal\u014buy speech style years following their acquisition of the everyday speech style from their cross cousins who would speak in Dyal\u014buy in their presence. By the onset of puberty, the child probably spoke Dyal\u014buy fluently and was able to use it in the appropriate contexts.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1989\"/> This phenomenon, commonly called [[mother-in-law languages]], was common in indigenous Australian languages. It existed until about 1930, when the taboo system fell out of use.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Robert M. W.|authorlink=Robert M. W.

It is a member of the small [[Dyirbalic languages|Dyirbalic]] branch of the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages|Pama\u2013Nyungan family]]. It possesses many outstanding features that have made it well known among [[linguistics|linguist]]s.\n\nIn the years since the Dyirbal grammar by [[Robert M. W. Dixon|Robert Dixon]] was published in 1972, Dyirbal has steadily moved closer to [[language death|extinction]] as younger community members have failed to learn it.<ref>Schmidt, A: \"Young People's Dyirbal: An Example of Language Death from Australia\" (Cambridge University Press, 1985)</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nDyirbal dialects of the [[Mamu]] people are Wa\u027dibara, Dulgubara, Bagi\u027dgabara, Dyi\u027dibara, Mandubara.\n\n==Phonology==\n\nDyirbal has only four [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] for the [[stop consonant|stop]] and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], whereas most other Australian Aboriginal languages have six. This is because Dyirbal lacks the [[Dental consonant|dental]]/[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]/[[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] split typically found in these languages. Like the majority of Australian languages, it does not make a distinction between voiced consonants (such as b, d, g, etc.) and voiceless consonants (the corresponding p, t, and k, etc. respectively). Like [[Pinyin]], standard Dyirbal [[orthography]] uses voiced consonants, which seem to be preferred by speakers of most Australian languages since the sounds (which can often be semi-voiced) are closer to English semi-voiced ''b, d, g'' than aspirated ''p, t, k''.\n\nThe Dyirbal [[vowel]] system is typical of Australia, with three vowels: {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, though {{IPA|/u/}} is realised as {{IPA|[o]}} in certain environments and {{IPA|/a/}} can be realised as {{IPA|[e]}}, also depending on the environment in which the [[phoneme]] appears.{{elucidate|If we know which environments these are, we should give them.|date=February 2015}} Thus the actual inventory of sounds is greater than the inventory of phonemes would suggest. Stress always falls on the first syllable of a word and usually on subsequent odd-numbered syllables except the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]], which is always unstressed. The result of this is that consecutive stressed syllables do not occur.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2| [[Peripheral consonant|Peripheral]]\n!

They tend to be divided among the following [[semantic]] lines:\n\n* I \u2013 most animate objects, men\n* II \u2013 women, [[water]], [[fire]], [[violence]], and exceptional [[animal]]s<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=George Lakoff |last=Lakoff |first=George |year=1990 |title=[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=5 }}</ref>\n* III \u2013 edible [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s\n* IV \u2013 miscellaneous (includes things not classifiable in the first three)\n\nThe class usually labelled \"feminine\" (II) inspired the title of [[George Lakoff]]'s book ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''. Some [[Linguistics|linguists]] distinguish between such systems of classification and the [[grammatical gender|gendered division]] of items into the categories of \"feminine\", \"masculine\" and (sometimes) \"neuter\" that is found in, for example, many [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nDyirbal shows a [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] system. Sentences with a first or second person pronoun have their [[verb argument]]s marked for [[Case (linguistics)|case]] in a pattern that mimics [[nominative\u2013accusative language]]s. That is, the first or second person pronoun appears in the least marked case when it is the subject (regardless of the [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] of the verb), and in the most marked case when it is the direct object.

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"Hui14Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

The virus is primarily spread between people through close contact and via [[respiratory droplets]] produced from coughs or sneezes.<ref name=\"WHO2020QA\" /><ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /> It [[Viral

for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NZ gov\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans and when the strain became [[pathogen]]ic remains unclear.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA metagenomic study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===\n{{Infobox genome\n| image   = File:SARS-CoV-2 genome.svg\n|

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS).

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed on 12 February 1950 by 23 broadcasting organisations from Europe and the Mediterranean at a conference in Devon, United Kingdom. It was on 6 June 1954, that Montreux became the venue for the first transmission by the EBU's Eurovision Network of the Narcissus Festival and its flower-bedecked procession floats. At Monaco, in late January 1955, this committee, chaired by Marcel Bezen\u00e7on, director general of Swiss Television, came up with the idea of creating a song contest, inspired by the very popular San Remo Festival. The idea was approved by the EBU General Assembly in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first \"Eurovision Grand Prix\" \u2013 so baptised, incidentally, by a British journalist \u2013 would take place in spring 1956 at Lugano, Switzerland.}}</ref> At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with [[Marcel Bezen\u00e7on]] of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by [[Sergio Pugliese]] of the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]]) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously across all countries of the union.<ref name=\"bristol\" /><ref name=\"GoldenJubilee\">{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Jaquin |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811033906/http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 August 2004 |title=Eurovision's Golden Jubilee |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}</ref> The competition was based upon the existing [[Sanremo Music Festival]] held in Italy<ref>{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]] |year=2003 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224074456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history/ |archivedate=24 December 2007 |title=History of Eurovision |accessdate=20 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> and was seen as a technological experiment in [[live television]].

However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.<ref name=\"Euroclub\"/>\n\n== Rules ==\n{{Further|Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nNumerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.\n\n=== Live music ===\nAll vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> In 1999, [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|the Croatian song]] performed by [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]] and composed by [[Ton\u010di Hulji\u0107]] featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.<ref name=\"ESC1999\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231130541/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted\u2014although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> The host that year, Israel's [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nEach submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966, a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer [[Ingvar Wixell]] performing [[Absent Friend|Sweden's 1965 entry]] in English.<ref name=\"milestones\"/> The Swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at [[Melodifestivalen 1965]], but it was later translated into English for the Eurovision contest.\n\nThe language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.<ref name=\"ESC1973\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523025310/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974.

Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]] or an Italian presenter might be seen with the [[Colosseum]] in the background.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, some countries did not have their spokesperson in front of a backdrop of a famous place, instead opting to show the spokesperson in the studio or in a famous building, for example when Malta presented their votes from a hotel in the country in 1995, or have them standing behind a blurred image of the famous building or skyline. From the 2000s, new technology meant that the spokespersons could be standing behind a live video of a famous place in that country. There have also been occasions where the backdrop of the spokesperson is not a still image or video, but instead is a slideshow of multiple shots of many of that country's famous buildings.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO codes]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=12 May 2004 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |title=Eurovision 2004 \u2013 Voting Briefing |accessdate=7 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507155415/http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |archivedate=7 May 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] one of the Swiss jurors presented his votes with flamboyant gestures.

Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. For this reason, the expression ''{{lang|fr|douze points}}'' when the host or spokesperson states the top score in French is popularly associated with the contest throughout the continent.<ref name=\"1999rules\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=13 October 1998|url=http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|title=Rules of the 44th Eurovision Song Contest, 1999|accessdate=18 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723152907/http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 2016, only the name of the top jury votegetter is announced, with the points awarded to the other nine countries shown in an on-screen scoreboard during the announcement. In addition, only the jury points are announced by country. The televoting results are announced in aggregate, from the lowest-scoring country to the highest. In the 2019 contest the televoting results were announced in aggregate in inverse standing order based on the jury votes; starting with Spain (7 points from the juries) and culminating in Sweden (239 points from the juries). After the winner has been announced, the televoting points from the country where the contest is watched from are briefly seen on screen.\n\n==== Ties for first place ====\nIn {{ESCYr|1969}}, four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.<ref name=\"ESC1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523004804/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ESC1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231092150/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,<ref name=\"RULES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}</ref> but since 2008 has been applied to all places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in {{ESCYr|1991}}, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, there was no televote, and the tie break was to determine which country had received the most sets of twelve points, then ten points, and so on.

As a result, the EBU reverted to the older relegation system for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] contests.

With regard to the automatic grand final qualifiers, who do not participate in the semi-finals, a draw is conducted to determine in which semi-final each of them will be allowed to vote. In contrast, ''every'' participating country in a particular year may vote in the Saturday grand final \u2013 whether their song qualified for the final or not.\n\nThe ten countries which receive the most votes in each semi-final qualify for the grand final. They are announced by the presenters in English and French, in a random order.

Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.\n\nThe total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.\n\nTo try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.<ref name=\"juryconfirmed\">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |title=EBU confirms 50/50 vote for Eurovision Song Contest |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=8 December 2008 |website=ESCToday |accessdate=8 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002140/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}</ref> This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"Countries\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive%3A+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|title=Exclusive: 39 countries to be represented in Oslo|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=31 December 2009|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|accessdate=31 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103100815/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive:+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|archive-date=3 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Turkey and Azerbaijan, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.\n\nAn overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. Together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. Result of such a study are presented in this paper.<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al 2018\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s42001-018-0020-2|title = Preference and neglect amongst countries in the Eurovision Song Contest| journal=Journal of Computational Social Science| volume=1| issue=2| pages=377\u2013390|year = 2018|last1 = Mantzaris|first1 = Alexander V.| last2=Rein| first2=Samuel R.| last3=Hopkins| first3=Alexander D.}}</ref> From the analysis it can be seen that countries which exhibit these biases do not receive a penalization from other participants and it presents itself as a means to accumulate more points by establishing these partnerships.\n\n=== Running order of the participating songs ===\nFrom 2013 onwards, the final and the semi-finals running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the show's producers and then approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed on 12 February 1950 by 23 broadcasting organisations from Europe and the Mediterranean at a conference in Devon, United Kingdom. It was on 6 June 1954, that Montreux became the venue for the first transmission by the EBU's Eurovision Network of the Narcissus Festival and its flower-bedecked procession floats. At Monaco, in late January 1955, this committee, chaired by Marcel Bezen\u00e7on, director general of Swiss Television, came up with the idea of creating a song contest, inspired by the very popular San Remo Festival. The idea was approved by the EBU General Assembly in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first \"Eurovision Grand Prix\" \u2013 so baptised, incidentally, by a British journalist \u2013 would take place in spring 1956 at Lugano, Switzerland.}}</ref> At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with [[Marcel Bezen\u00e7on]] of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by [[Sergio Pugliese]] of the Italian broadcaster [[RAI]]) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously across all countries of the union.<ref name=\"bristol\" /><ref name=\"GoldenJubilee\">{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Jaquin |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811033906/http://www.ebu.ch/en/union/diffusion_on_line/television/tcm_6-8971.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 August 2004 |title=Eurovision's Golden Jubilee |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}</ref> The competition was based upon the existing [[Sanremo Music Festival]] held in Italy<ref>{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]] |year=2003 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224074456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2003/history/ |archivedate=24 December 2007 |title=History of Eurovision |accessdate=20 July 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> and was seen as a technological experiment in [[live television]].

However, in the new millennium the trend has been for the national delegations to centralise their activity and hold their celebrations in the Euroclub.<ref name=\"Euroclub\"/>\n\n== Rules ==\n{{Further|Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nNumerous detailed rules must be observed by the participating nations, and a new version is produced each year, for instance the rules specify various deadlines, including the date by which all the participating broadcasters must submit the final recorded version of their song to the EBU. The rules also cover sponsorship agreements and rights of broadcasters to re-transmit the show. The most notable rules which affect the format and presentation of the contest have changed over the years, and are highlighted here.\n\n=== Live music ===\nAll vocals must be sung live; no voices are permitted on the backing tracks.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> In 1999, [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999|the Croatian song]] performed by [[Doris Dragovi\u0107]] and composed by [[Ton\u010di Hulji\u0107]] featured sounds on their backing track which sounded suspiciously like human voices. The Croatian delegation stated that there were no human voices, but only digitally synthesised sounds which replicated vocals. The EBU nevertheless decided that they had broken the spirit of the rules, and docked them 33% of their points total that year for the purpose of calculating their five-year points average for future qualification.<ref name=\"ESC1999\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1999|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231130541/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=314|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1956 until 1998, the host country was required to provide a live orchestra. Before 1973, all music had to be played by the host orchestra. From 1973 onwards, pre-recorded, non-vocal backing tracks were permitted\u2014although the host country was still obliged to provide a live orchestra to give participants a choice. If a backing track was used, then all the instruments heard on the track were required to be present on the stage. In 1997 this requirement was dropped.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn 1999 the requirement for a live orchestra was removed: it was left as an optional contribution.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> The host that year, Israel's [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], decided not to use an orchestra to save expenses, and thus 1999 was the first year when all the songs were played as pre-recorded backing tracks (in conjunction with live vocals).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Languages in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\nEach submission must have vocals; purely instrumental music has never been allowed. In the past, competitors have been required to sing in one of their own national languages, but this rule has been changed several times over the years. From 1956 until 1965, there was no rule restricting the languages in which the songs could be sung. In 1966, a rule was imposed stating that the songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, after Sweden was the first country to not sing in their own language, with opera singer [[Ingvar Wixell]] performing [[Absent Friend|Sweden's 1965 entry]] in English.<ref name=\"milestones\"/> The Swedish-language version of the song was originally selected at [[Melodifestivalen 1965]], but it was later translated into English for the Eurovision contest.\n\nThe language restriction continued until 1973, when performers were again allowed to sing in any language they wished.<ref name=\"ESC1973\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1973|accessdate=21 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523025310/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=289|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Several winners in the mid-1970s took advantage of this: performers from non-English-speaking countries sang in English, including [[ABBA]] in 1974.

Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over [[telephone line]]s; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson standing in front of a backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the [[Eiffel Tower]] or an Italian presenter might be seen with the [[Colosseum]] in the background.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, some countries did not have their spokesperson in front of a backdrop of a famous place, instead opting to show the spokesperson in the studio or in a famous building, for example when Malta presented their votes from a hotel in the country in 1995, or have them standing behind a blurred image of the famous building or skyline. From the 2000s, new technology meant that the spokespersons could be standing behind a live video of a famous place in that country. There have also been occasions where the backdrop of the spokesperson is not a still image or video, but instead is a slideshow of multiple shots of many of that country's famous buildings.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, the participating countries were called in reverse order of the presentation of their songs, and from 1963 to 2003, they were called in the same order in which their songs had been presented (except for 1974). Since 2004, when semi-finals were introduced, the order of the countries' announcements of votes has changed; and the countries that did not make it to the final each year could also vote. In 2004, the countries were called in alphabetical order (according to their [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO codes]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=12 May 2004 |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |title=Eurovision 2004 \u2013 Voting Briefing |accessdate=7 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507155415/http://www.eurovision.tv/archive_2004/english/1098.htm |archivedate=7 May 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2005, the votes from the non-qualifying semi-finalists were announced first, in their running order on the Thursday night; then the finalists gave their votes in their own order of performance.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] one of the Swiss jurors presented his votes with flamboyant gestures. This system was retired the next year.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] no public votes were presented: a closed jury simply announced that Switzerland had won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1956|work=Eurovision.tv|access-date=19 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231055819/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=273|archive-date=31 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> From 1957 to 1987, the points were displayed on a physical [[scoreboard]] to the side of the stage.

Countries must announce the country names and points in either English or French and the scores are repeated by the contest's presenters in the other language. For this reason, the expression ''{{lang|fr|douze points}}'' when the host or spokesperson states the top score in French is popularly associated with the contest throughout the continent.<ref name=\"1999rules\">{{cite web|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|date=13 October 1998|url=http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|title=Rules of the 44th Eurovision Song Contest, 1999|accessdate=18 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723152907/http://www.eurosong.net/archive/esc1999.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 2016, only the name of the top jury votegetter is announced, with the points awarded to the other nine countries shown in an on-screen scoreboard during the announcement. In addition, only the jury points are announced by country. The televoting results are announced in aggregate, from the lowest-scoring country to the highest. In the 2019 contest the televoting results were announced in aggregate in inverse standing order based on the jury votes; starting with Spain (7 points from the juries) and culminating in Sweden (239 points from the juries). After the winner has been announced, the televoting points from the country where the contest is watched from are briefly seen on screen.\n\n==== Ties for first place ====\nIn {{ESCYr|1969}}, four of the sixteen countries taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. There was nothing in the rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among most of the other participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.<ref name=\"ESC1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1969|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523004804/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=286|archive-date=23 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ESC1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1970|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231092150/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=223|archive-date=31 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe current tie-break procedure was implemented in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]]. In the procedure, sometimes known as a [[Issues affecting the single transferable vote#Countback|countback]], if two (or more) countries tie, the song receiving more points from the televote is the winner. If the songs received the same number of televote points, the song that received at least one televote point from the greatest number of countries is the winner. If there is still a tie, a second tie-breaker counts the number of countries who assigned twelve televote points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. If the tie cannot be resolved after the number of countries which assigned one point to the song is equal, the song performed earlier in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed earlier (in which case the song performed later would be the winner). The tie-break procedure originally applied only to first place ties,<ref name=\"RULES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|title=Public rules of the 60th Eurovision Song Contest|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=1 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430201605/http://www.eurovision.tv/upload/press-downloads/2015/2014-09-02_2015_ESC_rules_EN_PUBLIC_RULES.pdf|archivedate=30 April 2015}}</ref> but since 2008 has been applied to all places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1469 |work=Eurovision.tv |title=Eurovision 2008 Final |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the only time since 1969 when two or more countries have tied for first place on total points alone was in {{ESCYr|1991}}, when France and Sweden both totalled 146 points. At that time, there was no televote, and the tie break was to determine which country had received the most sets of twelve points, then ten points, and so on. Both France and Sweden had received four sets of 12 points, but Sweden had received more sets of 10-point scores, they were declared the winners. Had the current predominant tiebreaker been in play, France would have won instead by virtue of receiving points from more overall countries.<ref name=\"50yrs\"/>\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\nEach participating broadcaster is required to broadcast the show in its entirety: including all songs, recap, voting and reprise, skipping only the interval act for advertising breaks if they wish.<ref name=\"RULES\"/> From 1999 onwards, broadcasters who wished to do so were given the opportunity to take more advertising breaks as short, non-essential hiatuses were introduced into the programme.<ref name=\"1999rules\"/> Four major interruptions or preemptions of the contest broadcast have taken place since 1999.

The only Big 5 country that has never finished last since the introduction of this concept is Italy: since its return in 2011, the country placed in the top 10 seven times out of 9 contests, including four times in the top 5, a third place and twice as the runner up; its worst place was a 21st in 2014.

The worst example of this was that Bosnia and Herzegovina finished 7th with 86 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]], but it wasn't enough to save the country being relegated from taking part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 Contest]]. As a result, the EBU reverted to the older relegation system for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] contests. Soon, the EBU created what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem.

In 1989, Yugoslavia won the contest with \"[[Rock Me (Riva song)|Rock Me]]\" performed by [[Riva (band)|Riva]], who won the Yugoslav selection competition that year representing (along with 2 more acts) the Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Croatia. The 1990 contest was subsequently held in Zagreb, now the capital of Croatia.\n\nThe early years of the contest saw many wins for \"traditional\" Eurovision countries: France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

The current research into the analysis of the voting patterns has been used in notable sources, such as the Economist, for investigating whether over 10-year periods such collusion is increasing or decreasing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Economist|first1=DailyChart|title=Partisanship at Eurovision is becoming more blatant|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2018/05/daily-chart-7|journal=Economist|accessdate=11 May 2018|date=2018-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511153023/https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2018/05/daily-chart-7|archive-date=11 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Economist|first1=WarableGames|title=Neighbourly voting in the Eurovision Song Contest|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21742117-continents-annual-singing-tournament-becoming-increasingly-partisan-neighbourly-voting|journal=Economist|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=2018-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512021846/https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21742117-continents-annual-singing-tournament-becoming-increasingly-partisan-neighbourly-voting|archive-date=12 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 475\n | footer = Produced using the methods presented in<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al\" /> and<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al 2018\" /> a network of the significant score deviations can be viewed over a time period of interest.\n | image1 = The collusion between countries in Eurovision 1997 to 2017.png\n | alt1 = Collusion in Eurovision 1997 to 2017\n | caption1 = The collusion between countries in Eurovision 1997 to 2017\n | image2 = Mutual neglect of score allocations in the Eurovision 2010 to 2015.png\n | alt2 = Neglect in Eurovision 2010 to 2015\n | caption2 = Mutual neglect of score allocations in the Eurovision 2010 to 2015\n }}\n\nAs an example, [[Terry Wogan]], the United Kingdom's presenter of Eurovision since 1980 and one of the only three presenters mentioned by name during the contest proper<ref>{{cite episode|title=Eurovision Song Contest 2008|episodelink = Eurovision Song Contest 2008|series=Eurovision Song Contest|serieslink=Eurovision Song Contest|airdate=24 May 2008}}</ref> stood down from [[BBC One]]'s broadcast in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] saying \"The voting used to be about the songs.

Although judges and televoters cannot vote for their own country's entry, expatriates can vote for their country of origin.\n\nThe total numbers of points to be distributed by each country are equal, irrespective of the country's population. Thus voters in countries with larger populations have less power as individuals to influence the result of the contest than those voting in smaller countries. For example, San Marino holds the same voting power as Russia despite the vast geographic and population differences between them.\n\nTo try to reduce the effect of voting blocs, national juries were re-introduced alongside televoting in the final in 2009: each contributing 50% of the vote.<ref name=\"juryconfirmed\">{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |title=EBU confirms 50/50 vote for Eurovision Song Contest |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=8 December 2008 |website=ESCToday |accessdate=8 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211002140/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12655 |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}</ref> This hybrid system was expanded in 2010 to also be implemented in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"Countries\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive%3A+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|title=Exclusive: 39 countries to be represented in Oslo|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=31 December 2009|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]|accessdate=31 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103100815/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=7923&_t=Exclusive:+39+countries+to+be+represented+in+Oslo|archive-date=3 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> However, since 1994 no country has won two years in a row, and semi-finals have also been won by different countries, until 2012 when Sweden won the second semi-final in 2011 and 2012. Although many of them used to give their 12 points to the same country each year, like Turkey and Azerbaijan, it has been noticed that factors such as the sets of other high votes received (7, 8 or 10 points) and the number of countries giving points to a specific entry, also highly affect the final positions.\n\nAn overview of the overall preference between countries that exhibits patterns of high score allocations is a question that appears frequently and recently a new study investigates the question of 'neglect' in the competition. The concept of 'neglect' here is represented by countries which produce patterns of biased low score allocations to certain countries. Together these two patterns provide a better view of the competition's intrinsic country pair biases. Result of such a study are presented in this paper.<ref name=\"Mantzaris et al 2018\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s42001-018-0020-2|title = Preference and neglect amongst countries in the Eurovision Song Contest| journal=Journal of Computational Social Science| volume=1| issue=2| pages=377\u2013390|year = 2018|last1 = Mantzaris|first1 = Alexander V.| last2=Rein| first2=Samuel R.| last3=Hopkins| first3=Alexander D.}}</ref> From the analysis it can be seen that countries which exhibit these biases do not receive a penalization from other participants and it presents itself as a means to accumulate more points by establishing these partnerships.\n\n=== Running order of the participating songs ===\nFrom 2013 onwards, the final and the semi-finals running order of the competing performances at the semi-finals and the final has been decided by the show's producers and then approved by the EBU Executive Supervisor and the Reference Group.

Ponsse Plc develops and manufactures sustainable and innovative harvesting solutions for environmentally friendly [[cut-to-length logging]]. The strong family company is one of the world\u2019s leading forest machine manufacturers <ref>https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286234-ponsse-quality-comes-price-tag</ref>[1], and its customer-oriented operations are still guided by the wishes and needs of forest machine entrepreneurs. The Ponsse company was established by the forest machine entrepreneur [[Einari Vidgr\u00e9n]] in 1970. The company\u2019s roots are deep in the Finnish countryside and Finnish work, but nowadays the company is quite involved in the international market. Today, Ponsse's machines are used at logging sites in approximately 40 countries, and 80 per cent of the company\u2019s net sales come from exports.<ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin\n</ref> All machines are manufactured in the company\u2019s birthplace in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. Ponsse Group employs more than 1,800 people in 10 countries, and the company\u2019s shares are quoted on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic List. \n\n==History==\n===1970s - Early years===\n\nEntrepreneur [[Einari Vidgren]] receives encouraging feedback on machines he has built. He decides to set up a forest machine factory in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. However, help is required by the municipality of Vierem\u00e4 in order to finance the project. A meeting is held by the municipal council, and they vote on the matter. The council approves the proposal with a majority of a single vote. The work is completed by the end of 1970, and Ponsse Plc is established as a result. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Einari places an ad in the [[Helsingin Sanomat]] news paper in order to recruit an engineer for the factory. An application by Jouko Kelppe, a young engineer from [[Salo]], attracts the most attention. Jouko is hired to be the first ever engineer in the history of Ponsse. The manufacturing of the first machine is started in the spring of 1971. A forest machine contractor Eero Vainikainen is in the process of purchasing a [[Volvo]] or [[Valmet]] machine. However, after strong persuasion and visiting the Ponsse factory, he decides to buy the first ever Ponsse machine. The machine is driven out of the factory by Einari in the autumn of 1971. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\nPonsse premieres in the international markets in 1974. A massive storm hits [[Germany]], and a large number of foreign equipment is needed for harvesting the trees felled by the storm. Einari hears that the job is well compensated, and sets out to Germany, accompanied by Finnish loggers and a Ponsse machine. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\n===1980s - Innovation and growth, Ponsse is sold===\n\nMechanized harvesting is increasing worldwide, and heavy machinery is becoming a talking point. The public demands lighter and more eco-friendly machines. Ponsse releases a new model S 15 [[forwarder]] in 1983. The machine is highly advanced at the time, as it is lighter but is still able to carry heavy loads, as well as function on soil with poor bearing capacity. <ref>https://en.wheelsage.org/ponsse/ergo/hs15/pictures/cjbufj</ref> \n\nEinari is not satisfied with the [[grapples]], or [[harvester heads]], used in Ponsse machines. He wants Ponsse to make their own harvester heads. The first product, H520 is not completely trouble-free, and causes many problems for the company. Learning from these mistakes, a new model called H60 is released at the end of 1985. This marks an important step in the expansion of the product family. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin</ref>\n\nOn 16th of December in 1988, Ponsse's entire share capital is transferred to the industrial company called Interpolator Oy, a part of SKOP Group. This makes Ponsse a part of Norcar Group, along with some earlier acquisitions.

Ponsse Plc develops and manufactures sustainable and innovative harvesting solutions for environmentally friendly [[cut-to-length logging]]. The strong family company is one of the world\u2019s leading forest machine manufacturers <ref>https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286234-ponsse-quality-comes-price-tag</ref>[1], and its customer-oriented operations are still guided by the wishes and needs of forest machine entrepreneurs. The Ponsse company was established by the forest machine entrepreneur [[Einari Vidgr\u00e9n]] in 1970. The company\u2019s roots are deep in the Finnish countryside and Finnish work, but nowadays the company is quite involved in the international market. Today, Ponsse's machines are used at logging sites in approximately 40 countries, and 80 per cent of the company\u2019s net sales come from exports.<ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin\n</ref> All machines are manufactured in the company\u2019s birthplace in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. Ponsse Group employs more than 1,800 people in 10 countries, and the company\u2019s shares are quoted on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic List. \n\n==History==\n===1970s - Early years===\n\nEntrepreneur [[Einari Vidgren]] receives encouraging feedback on machines he has built. He decides to set up a forest machine factory in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. However, help is required by the municipality of Vierem\u00e4 in order to finance the project. A meeting is held by the municipal council, and they vote on the matter. The council approves the proposal with a majority of a single vote. The work is completed by the end of 1970, and Ponsse Plc is established as a result. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Einari places an ad in the [[Helsingin Sanomat]] news paper in order to recruit an engineer for the factory. An application by Jouko Kelppe, a young engineer from [[Salo]], attracts the most attention. Jouko is hired to be the first ever engineer in the history of Ponsse. The manufacturing of the first machine is started in the spring of 1971. A forest machine contractor Eero Vainikainen is in the process of purchasing a [[Volvo]] or [[Valmet]] machine. However, after strong persuasion and visiting the Ponsse factory, he decides to buy the first ever Ponsse machine. The machine is driven out of the factory by Einari in the autumn of 1971. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\nPonsse premieres in the international markets in 1974. A massive storm hits [[Germany]], and a large number of foreign equipment is needed for harvesting the trees felled by the storm. Einari hears that the job is well compensated, and sets out to Germany, accompanied by Finnish loggers and a Ponsse machine. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\n===1980s - Innovation and growth, Ponsse is sold===\n\nMechanized harvesting is increasing worldwide, and heavy machinery is becoming a talking point. The public demands lighter and more eco-friendly machines. Ponsse releases a new model S 15 [[forwarder]] in 1983. The machine is highly advanced at the time, as it is lighter but is still able to carry heavy loads, as well as function on soil with poor bearing capacity. <ref>https://en.wheelsage.org/ponsse/ergo/hs15/pictures/cjbufj</ref> \n\nEinari is not satisfied with the [[grapples]], or [[harvester heads]], used in Ponsse machines. He wants Ponsse to make their own harvester heads. The first product, H520 is not completely trouble-free, and causes many problems for the company. Learning from these mistakes, a new model called H60 is released at the end of 1985. This marks an important step in the expansion of the product family. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin</ref>\n\nOn 16th of December in 1988, Ponsse's entire share capital is transferred to the industrial company called Interpolator Oy, a part of SKOP Group. This makes Ponsse a part of Norcar Group, along with some earlier acquisitions. Einari becomes a board member of Norcar Group, and Einari's brother, Esa Vidgren, is appointed as the managing director of Ponsse Plc. <ref>https://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/art-2000006124591.html</ref>\n\n===1990s - Globalization, Einari buys Ponsse back===\n\nThe computerized Kajaani 2000 loader control system represents the latest trend in the product development of forest machine control systems.
