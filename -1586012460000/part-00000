Jablonski went on to prove that people living above the latitudes of 50 degrees have the highest chance of developing vitamin D deficiency. \"This was one of the last barriers in the history of human settlement,\" Jablonski states. \"Only after humans learned fishing, and therefore had access to food rich in vitamin D, could they settle regions of [[high latitude]].\"\nPeople living far from the equator developed light skin to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D during winter with low levels of UV radiation.

There are health implications of light-skinned people living in environments of high UV radiation. Various cultural practices increase problems related to health conditions of light skin, for example [[sunbathing]] among the light-skinned.<ref name=jabl1/>\n\n===Advantages in low sunlight===\nHumans with light skin pigmentation living in low sunlight environments experience increased [[vitamin D]] synthesis compared to humans with dark skin pigmentation due to the ability to absorb more sunlight. Almost every part of the human body, including the skeleton, the immune system, and brain requires vitamin D. Sunlight is necessary for the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D production in the skin begins when UV radiation penetrates the skin and interacts with a cholesterol-like molecule produce pre-vitamin D3. This reaction only occurs in the presence of medium length UVR, UVB. Most of the UVB and UVC rays are destroyed or reflected by ozone, oxygen, and dust in the atmosphere. UVB reaches the Earth\u2019s surface in the highest amounts when its path is straight and goes through a little layer of atmosphere.\n\nThe farther a place is from the equator, the less UVB is received, and the potential to produce of vitamin D is diminished. Some regions far from the equator do not receive UVB radiation at all between autumn and spring.<ref name=LivCol>{{cite book|author=Jablonski, Nina|title=Living Color|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-25153-3}}</ref> Vitamin D deficiency does not kill its victims quickly, and generally does not kill at all. Rather it weakens the immune system, the bones, and compromises the body\u2019s ability to fight uncontrolled cell division which results in cancer. A form of vitamin D is a potent cell growth inhibitor; thus chronic deficiencies of vitamin D seem to be associated with higher risk of certain cancers. This is an active topic of cancer research and is still debated.<ref name=LivCol/>\n\nWith the increase of vitamin D synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions that are related to common vitamin D deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of low UV radiation: [[rickets]], [[osteoporosis]], numerous [[cancer]] types (including [[Colon cancer|colon]] and [[breast cancer]]), and immune system malfunctioning.

The most common risk that comes with high exposure to sunlight is the increased risk of [[sunburn]]s. This increased risk has come along with the cultural practice of sunbathing, which is popular among some human populations. This cultural practice to gain tanned skin if not regulated properly can lead to sunburn, especially among very lightly-skinned humans. The overexposure to sunlight also can lead to [[basal cell carcinoma]], which is a common form of [[skin cancer]].\n\nAnother health implication is the [[Folate deficiency|depletion of folate]] within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to [[megaloblastic anemia]]. Folate deficiency in pregnant women can be detrimental to the health of their newborn babies in the form of [[neural tube defect]]s, [[miscarriage]]s, and [[spina bifida]], a birth defect in which the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] and [[spinal canal]] do not close before birth.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Djukic, A.|title=Folate-resposive neurologic diseases|journal=[[Pediatric Neurology]]|year=2007|volume=37|issue=6|pages=387\u2013397|doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2007.09.001|pmid=18021918}}</ref> The peak of neural tube defect occurrences is the highest in the May\u2013June period in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=jabl1/> Folate is needed for [[DNA replication]] in dividing cells and deficiency can lead to failures of normal [[embryogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]].<ref name=jabl1/><ref name=\"oneil1\"/><ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|author=Jablonski, N.G.|author2=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|issue=1|pages=57\u2013106|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403|pmid=10896812}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals with lightly pigmented skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster aging of the skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation.

Some of these genes are found to be more prevalent in certain population than others.\n\n==Health implications==\nSkin pigmentation is an evolutionary adaptation to the various UV radiation levels around the world. There are health implications of light-skinned people living in environments of high UV radiation. Various cultural practices increase problems related to health conditions of light skin, for example [[sunbathing]] among the light-skinned.<ref name=jabl1/>\n\n===Advantages in low sunlight===\nHumans with light skin pigmentation living in low sunlight environments experience increased [[vitamin D]] synthesis compared to humans with dark skin pigmentation due to the ability to absorb more sunlight. Almost every part of the human body, including the skeleton, the immune system, and brain requires vitamin D. Sunlight is necessary for the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D production in the skin begins when UV radiation penetrates the skin and interacts with a cholesterol-like molecule produce pre-vitamin D3. This reaction only occurs in the presence of medium length UVR, UVB. Most of the UVB and UVC rays are destroyed or reflected by ozone, oxygen, and dust in the atmosphere. UVB reaches the Earth\u2019s surface in the highest amounts when its path is straight and goes through a little layer of atmosphere.\n\nThe farther a place is from the equator, the less UVB is received, and the potential to produce of vitamin D is diminished. Some regions far from the equator do not receive UVB radiation at all between autumn and spring.<ref name=LivCol>{{cite book|author=Jablonski, Nina|title=Living Color|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London|isbn=978-0-520-25153-3}}</ref> Vitamin D deficiency does not kill its victims quickly, and generally does not kill at all. Rather it weakens the immune system, the bones, and compromises the body\u2019s ability to fight uncontrolled cell division which results in cancer. A form of vitamin D is a potent cell growth inhibitor; thus chronic deficiencies of vitamin D seem to be associated with higher risk of certain cancers. This is an active topic of cancer research and is still debated.<ref name=LivCol/>\n\nWith the increase of vitamin D synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions that are related to common vitamin D deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of low UV radiation: [[rickets]], [[osteoporosis]], numerous [[cancer]] types (including [[Colon cancer|colon]] and [[breast cancer]]), and immune system malfunctioning.

The most common risk that comes with high exposure to sunlight is the increased risk of [[sunburn]]s. This increased risk has come along with the cultural practice of sunbathing, which is popular among some human populations. This cultural practice to gain tanned skin if not regulated properly can lead to sunburn, especially among very lightly-skinned humans. The overexposure to sunlight also can lead to [[basal cell carcinoma]], which is a common form of [[skin cancer]].\n\nAnother health implication is the [[Folate deficiency|depletion of folate]] within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to [[megaloblastic anemia]]. Folate deficiency in pregnant women can be detrimental to the health of their newborn babies in the form of [[neural tube defect]]s, [[miscarriage]]s, and [[spina bifida]], a birth defect in which the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] and [[spinal canal]] do not close before birth.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Djukic, A.|title=Folate-resposive neurologic diseases|journal=[[Pediatric Neurology]]|year=2007|volume=37|issue=6|pages=387\u2013397|doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2007.09.001|pmid=18021918}}</ref> The peak of neural tube defect occurrences is the highest in the May\u2013June period in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=jabl1/> Folate is needed for [[DNA replication]] in dividing cells and deficiency can lead to failures of normal [[embryogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]].<ref name=jabl1/><ref name=\"oneil1\"/><ref name=Jabl00>{{cite journal|author=Jablonski, N.G.|author2=Chaplin|title=The evolution of human skin coloration|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2000|volume=39|issue=1|pages=57\u2013106|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0403|pmid=10896812}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals with lightly pigmented skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster aging of the skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation.

This means that all the mines and ERW affecting the places where ordinary people live must be cleared, and their safety in areas that have been cleared must be guaranteed. Mines are cleared and the areas are thoroughly verified so that they can say without a doubt that the land is now safe, and people can use it without worrying about the weapons. The aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security at the community level.\n\n'''Mine clearance methods:'''\n*Surveying\n**Surveying, or the formal gathering of mine-related information, is required before actual clearance can begin. Impact surveys assess the socio-economic impact of the mine contamination and help assign priorities for the clearance of particular areas. Impact surveys make use of all available sources of information, including minefield records (where they exist), data about mine victims, and interviews with former combatants and local people. Technical surveys then define the minefields and provide detailed maps for the clearance operations.\n*Maps\n**Maps resulting from the impact surveys and technical surveys are stored in an information management system, including a variety of programme databases, and provide baseline data for clearance organisations and operational planning.\n*Minefield marking\n**Minefield marking is carried out when a mined area is identified, but clearance operations cannot take place immediately. Minefield marking, which is intended to deter people from entering mined areas, has to be carried out in combination with mine awareness, so that the local population understands the meaning and importance of the signs.\n*Manual clearance\n**Manual clearance relies on trained deminers using metal detectors and long thin prodders to locate the mines, which are then destroyed by controlled explosion.\n*Mine detection dogs\n**Mine detection dogs, which detect the presence of explosives in the ground by smell. Dogs are used in combination with manual deminers.\n*Mechanical clearance \n**Mechanical clearance relies on flails, rollers, vegetation cutters and excavators, often attached to armoured bulldozers, to destroy the mines in the ground. These machines can only be used in certain terrains, and are expensive to operate. In most situations they are also not 100% reliable, and the work needs to be checked by other techniques.\n\n=== Mine Risk Education (MRE) ===\nRisk education, or RE, refers to educational activities aimed at reducing the risk of injury from mines and unexploded ordnance by raising awareness and promoting behavioural change through public-information campaigns, education and training, and liaison with communities.\n\nRE ensures that communities are aware of the risks from mines, unexploded ordnance and/or abandoned munitions and are encouraged to behave in ways that reduce the risk to people, property and the environment. Objectives are to reduce the risk to a level where people can live safely and to recreate an environment where economic and social development can occur free from the constraints imposed by landmine contamination.\n\nRE, along with demining (which includes technical surveys, mapping, clearance of unexploded ordnance and mines, marking unsafe areas, and documenting areas that have been cleared), contributes to mine-risk reduction, or limiting the risk of physical injury from mines and unexploded ordnance that already contaminates the land.   Advocacy and the destruction of landmine stockpiles focus on preventing future use of mines.\n\n\"Education and training\" in MRE encompasses all educational and training activities that reduce the risk of injury from mines, unexploded ordnance and/or abandoned munitions by raising awareness of the threat to individuals and communities and promoting behavioural change.    Education and training is a two-way process, which involves the imparting and acquiring of knowledge, changing attitudes and practices through teaching and learning.\n\nEducation and training activities may be conducted in formal and non-formal environments: teacher-to -child education in schools, information shared at home from parents to children or from children to their parents, child-to-child education, peer-to-peer education in work and recreational environments, landmine safety training for humanitarian aid workers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100926022938/http://mineaction.org/overview.asp?o=29 Learn about the Landmine and ERW Safety Project]) and the incorporation of landmine safety messages in occupational health and safety practices.\n\n=== Victim Assistance ===\nBuilding on the experience gained in this area since the entry into force of the [[Ottawa Treaty|Antipersonnel Mine Ban Treaty]] the negotiators of the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] agreed on a specific article on victim assistance (Article 5), which contains a number of obligations for States Parties with respect to cluster munition victims in areas under its jurisdiction and control. The Convention on Cluster Munitions also provides the following definition of cluster munition victims: \" (...) all persons who have been killed or suffered physical or psychological injury, economic loss, social marginalisation or substantial impairment of the realisation of their rights caused by the use of cluster munitions. They include those persons directly impacted by cluster munitions as well as their affected families and communities.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of mine and explosive remnants of war survivors exist in 78 countries.  According to the 2008 Landmine Monitor Report, there are up to 60,000 survivors in Afghanistan alone and over 45,000 in Cambodia. In 2011, the Landmine Monitor identified 4,286 new injuries around the world by mines, explosive remnants of war and victim-detonated [[improvised explosive devices]].<ref>[http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?url=lm/2012/ 2012 Landmine Monitor Report]</ref> While the actual figure is unknown, it may well be far greater, since many incidents of mine and explosive ordnance accidents are never reported and are therefore not registered.\n\nWithin the UN system, the United Nation Mine Action Service works closely with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and other UN entities, in particular [[UNICEF]], that also support victim assistance activities. They all work closely with partner organisations outside the United Nations system, such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], [[Survivor Corps]], [http://www.worldrehabfund.org/ World Rehabilitation Fund] (WRF), [http://www.handicap.be/ Handicap International Belgium] and [[Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation]] (VVAF).\n\n=== Advocacy ===\nUNMAS coordinates overall UN advocacy in support of treaties and other international legal instruments related to landmines and explosive remnants of war, including cluster munitions, and in support of the rights of people affected by these devices.\n\n'''Methods:'''\n* Public information dissemination\n** \"Public information\" in the context of mine action describes landmine and unexploded ordnance situations and informs and updates a broad range of stakeholders.   Such information may focus on local risk-reduction messages, address broader national issues such as complying with legislation or raise public support for mine-action programmes.\n** Public information \"dissemination,\" however, refers primarily to public-information activities that help reduce the risk of injury from mines and unexploded ordnance by raising awareness of the risk to individuals and communities, and by promoting behavioural change. It is primarily a one-way form of communication transmitted through mass media.   Public information-dissemination initiatives may be stand-alone MRE projects that are implemented in advance of other mine-action activities.\n* Community liaison\n** Community liaison refers to the systems and processes used to exchange information between national authorities, mine-action organisations and communities on the presence of mines, unexploded ordnance and abandoned munitions.   It enables communities to be informed about planned demining activities, the nature and duration of the tasks, and the exact locations of marked or cleared areas.   Furthermore, it enables communities to inform local authorities and mine-action organizations about the location, extent and impact of contaminated areas.   This information can greatly assist the planning of related activities, such as technical surveys, marking and clearance operations, and survivor-assistance services. Community liaison ensures that mine-action projects address community needs and priorities.   Community liaison should be carried out by all organizations conducting mine-action operations.\n\nCommunity liaison services may begin far in advance of demining activities and help the development of local capacities to assess the risks, manage information and develop risk-reduction strategies.\n\n=== Stockpile destruction ===\nStockpiled [[anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel landmines]] (APM) far outnumber those actually laid in the ground. In accordance with Article 4 of the [[Ottawa Treaty|anti-personnel mine-ban treaty]], State Parties must destroy their stockpiled mines within four years after their accession to the convention. Sixty-five countries have now destroyed their stockpiles of antipersonnel landmines, destroying a combined total of more than 37 million mines. Another 51 countries have officially declared not having a stockpile of antipersonnel mines and a further  three countries are scheduled to destroy their stockpiles by the end of the year.\n\nThere are many options available to states in destroying their stockpiles. Stockpiles are usually destroyed by the military, but an industrial solution can also be employed. The techniques used vary depending on the make-up of the mines and the conditions in which they are found. The complete destruction cycle involves aspects such as transportation and storage, processing operations, equipment maintenance, staff training and accounting, as well as the actual physical destruction.\n\n==  Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action ==\nThe Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action (IACG-MA) is a coalition of 12 United Nations offices, specialized agencies, funds and programmes that work to divide of labor within the United Nations regarding mine action. In order to achieve this, they created the '''''Mine Action and Effective Coordination: the United Nations Inter-Agency Policy''''' to effectively tackle the United Nation's mine action

and implementing activities to limit the threat posed by [[Land mine|mines]], [[Unexploded ordnance|explosive remnants of war]] and [[improvised explosive device]]s.\n\nThe Service operates under United Nations legislative mandates of both the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], as well as by request of affected Member States, the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] or their designated official.\n\n== History ==\nThe United Nations had been involved in [[mine action]] since it established the ''Mine Action Programme for Afghanistan'' in 1989. Additionally, in the early 1990's the organization was conducting various mine action activities in Cambodia, Angola, Bosnia and Mozambique as part of its Peacekeeping Operations.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_3289.pdf |title=UNMAS Mine Action Programming Handbook |authors=UNMAS |date=January 2012 |website=ReliefWeb |publisher=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs |access-date=3 December 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, UNMAS was not formally formed until 1997, when the Department of Peacekeeping Operation's Demining Unit and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs'  Mine Clearance and Policy Unit were merged.

The analyses conducted in 1983-1985 showed deviation of radioactive standards in 1,5-2 times, as a result of earlier accidental malfunctions of CNPP in 1982<ref name=\":3\" /> When the catastrophe occurred, groundwater irradiation was caused due to contamination of lands in the area of the wrecked fourth reactor. Furthermore, subsurface water was contaminated through unconfined aquifer in correlation and proportionally to contamination of soil by isotopes of [[Strontium]] and [[Caesium]] .<ref name=\":0\" /> Upper groundwater aquifer and most of [[Artesian aquifer]]s were damaged in first place due to massive surface contamination with radioactive isotopes [[Strontium-90]] and [[Caesium-137|Cesium-137]]. At the same time, considerable levels of radioactive content were fixed on the periphery of exclusion zone, including part of potable water delivery system. This revelation proved the fact of migration of radioactive contaminants through the groundwater aquifers<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the disaster, the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] aimed took delayed and inefficient measures at neutralization of consequences of the accident. The issue of groundwater contamination was improperly addressed the first several months after the disaster, leading to colossal financial expenses with negligible result. At the same time, proper monitoring of the situation was mostly absent<ref name=\":4\" /> The primary attempts of disaster relief workers were directed to prevention of surface waters contamination. Large-scale [[radionuclide]] content in the underground water was monitored and detected only in April\u2013May 1987, almost a year after the disaster<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Migration pathways of contamination ==\nUnfortunately, hydrological and geological conditions in [[Chernobyl]] area promoted rapid [[radionuclide]] migration to subsurface water network. These factors include flat terrain, abundant precipitation and highly permeable sandy sediments<ref name=\":2\" />  Main natural factors of [[nuclide]]s migration in the region can be divided into four groups, including: weather and climate-related (evaporation and precipitation frequency, intensity and distribution); geological (sediment permeability, drainage regimes, forms of vegetation); soil-borne (physical, hydrological and mechanical properties of lands); and [[Lithology|lithological]] (terrain structures and types of rock).<ref name=\":3\" /> In meliorated areas migration processes are additionally influenced by anthropogenic drivers related to human agricultural activities. In this relation, specific parameters and type of drainage regime, melioration practices, water control and sprinkling can substantially accelerate natural tempos of migration of contaminants. For example, artificial drainage leads to substantial increase of absorption and flushing rates.<ref name=\":3\" /> These technological factors are particularly significant for the regions along [[Pripyat River|Pripyat river]] and [[Dnieper|Dnieper river]], which are almost totally subject to artificial irrigation and drainage within the network of constructed reservoirs and dams.\n\nAt the same time, both natural and artificial factors of migration have specific prioritization for different contaminants. The primary way of [[Strontium-90]] transportation to the groundwater is its infiltration from contaminated soils and subsequent transition through the porous surfaces of unconfined aquifer.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Chernobyl -- what have we learned? : the successes and failures to mitigate water contamination over 20 years|editor=Onishi, Yasuo|editor2=Vo\u012dt\ufe20s\ufe21ekhovich, O. V. |editor3=Zheleznyak, Mark J.|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402053498|oclc=184984586}}</ref> The scholars also fixed two additional alternative ways of migration of this [[Radionuclide]]. The first one is \u201ctechnogenous\u201d transition, caused by poor construction of wells for water withdrawal or insufficient quality of materials used for their shells. During electric pumping of deep-laying artesian water, the stream unprotected passes through contaminated layers of upper aquifers and absorbs radioactive particles before getting into a well. This way of contamination was experimentally verified at the [[Kiev]] water intake wells.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another abnormal way of [[radionuclide]]s migration are weak zones of crystalline rocks. The researches of Center of Radio-ecological Studies of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] showed that crustal surface has unconsolidated zones characterized by increased electric productivity, as well as higher moisture and emanation capacity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs to [[Caesium-137|Cesium-137]], this [[nuclide]] demonstrates lower migration potential in [[Chernobyl]] soils and aquifers. Its mobility is hampered by such factors as: clay minerals which fixate [[radionuclide]] in rock, absorption and neutralization of isotopes through ion-exchange with other chemical components of water; partial neutralization by vegetation metabolic cycles; overall radioactive decay.<ref name=\":2\" /> Heavy isotopes of [[Plutonium]] and [[Americium]] have even lower transportation capacity both in and outside the exclusion zone. However, their hazardous potential should not be discarded considering extremely long [[half-life]] and unpredictable geo-chemical behavior<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Agricultural damage ==\nGroundwater transportation of [[radionuclide]]s belongs to the key pathways of contamination of lands engaged in agricultural production. In particular, due to vertical migration with rises of water levels, radioactive particles infiltrate soils and subsequently get into plants through the absorption system of their roots. This leads to internal irradiation of animals and people during consumption of contaminated vegetables<ref name=\":0\" /> This situation is aggravated by a predominantly rural type of settlement in the [[Chernobyl]] area, with most of population engaged in active agricultural production. It makes the authorities either remove the contaminated areas near [[Chernoby]]l from agricultural activities or spend funds for excavation and treatment of surface layers.<ref name=\":5\" /> These problems of damage to initially intact soils puts a heavy burden primarily on Ukrainian and especially Belorussian economy. Nearly one-quarter of the entire territory of [[Belarus]] was seriously contaminated with isotopes of [[Caesium|Cesium]]. The authorities were obliged to exclude nearly 265 thousands hectares of cultivated lands from agricultural use till present day. Although complex chemical and agro-technological measures led to limited decrease of [[radionuclide]] content in food produced on contaminated territories, the problem remains largely unresolved<ref>{{Citation|last=Bogdevitch|first=I.|title=Countermeasures on Natural and Agricultural Areas after Chernobyl Accident|date=2002|work=Role of GIS in Lifting the Cloud Off Chernobyl|pages=147\u2013158|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402007699|last2=Sanzharova|first2=N.|last3=Prister|first3=B.|last4=Tarasiuk|first4=S.|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-0518-0_12}}</ref>\nApart from economical damage, agricultural contamination via groundwater pathways is detrimental for biophysical security of the population.

The Ukrainian government initially implemented a costly and sophisticated remediation program. However, in view of limited financial resources and other more urgent health problems caused by the disaster, these plans were abandoned<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rail|first=Chester D.|date=2000-05-02|title=Groundwater Contamination, Volume II|doi=10.1201/9781482278958|isbn=9781482278958}}</ref> Not least, such a decision owed to the research results of domestic scholars showing that groundwater contamination does not contribute to the overall health risks substantially in regard to other active pathways of radioactive exposure in the \u201c[[exclusion zone]]\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In particular, radioactive contamination of unconfined aquifer, which is usually considered a serious threat, has fewer economical and health impact in Chernobyl because subsurface water in \u201c[[exclusion zone]]\u201d is not used for household and drinking needs. The probability of using this water by local residents is excluded by a special status of [[Chernobyl]] area and relevant administrative prohibitions. The only group directly and inevitably exposed to health threats are emergency workers engaged in water drainage practices related to [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] reactors deactivation and waste disposal operations.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs to contamination of confined aquifer, which is a source of technical and household water supply for [[Pripyat|Pripyat city]] (the largest city in Chernobyl area), it also does not pose immediate health threat due to permanent monitoring of water delivery system. In case any indexes of radioactive content exceed the norm, withdrawal of water from local boreholes will be suspended. Yet such situation poses a certain economic risk due to high expenditures necessary for ensuring alternative water supply system .<ref name=\":5\" /> At the same time, lethal doses of radiation in unconfined aquifer retain substantial prospective danger due to their considerable capacity of migration to confined aquifer and subsequently to surface water, primarily in [[Pripyat River|Pripyat river]]. This water can furthermore enter [[Tributary|tributaries]] of [[Dnieper|Dnieprer River]] and [[Kiev Reservoir]].<ref name=\":5\" /> In this way the number of animals and people using contaminated water for domestic purposes can drastically increase.

The analyses conducted in 1983-1985 showed deviation of radioactive standards in 1,5-2 times, as a result of earlier accidental malfunctions of CNPP in 1982<ref name=\":3\" /> When the catastrophe occurred, groundwater irradiation was caused due to contamination of lands in the area of the wrecked fourth reactor. Furthermore, subsurface water was contaminated through unconfined aquifer in correlation and proportionally to contamination of soil by isotopes of [[Strontium]] and [[Caesium]] .<ref name=\":0\" /> Upper groundwater aquifer and most of [[Artesian aquifer]]s were damaged in first place due to massive surface contamination with radioactive isotopes [[Strontium-90]] and [[Caesium-137|Cesium-137]]. At the same time, considerable levels of radioactive content were fixed on the periphery of exclusion zone, including part of potable water delivery system. This revelation proved the fact of migration of radioactive contaminants through the groundwater aquifers<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the disaster, the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] aimed took delayed and inefficient measures at neutralization of consequences of the accident. The issue of groundwater contamination was improperly addressed the first several months after the disaster, leading to colossal financial expenses with negligible result. At the same time, proper monitoring of the situation was mostly absent<ref name=\":4\" /> The primary attempts of disaster relief workers were directed to prevention of surface waters contamination. Large-scale [[radionuclide]] content in the underground water was monitored and detected only in April\u2013May 1987, almost a year after the disaster<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Migration pathways of contamination ==\nUnfortunately, hydrological and geological conditions in [[Chernobyl]] area promoted rapid [[radionuclide]] migration to subsurface water network. These factors include flat terrain, abundant precipitation and highly permeable sandy sediments<ref name=\":2\" />  Main natural factors of [[nuclide]]s migration in the region can be divided into four groups, including: weather and climate-related (evaporation and precipitation frequency, intensity and distribution); geological (sediment permeability, drainage regimes, forms of vegetation); soil-borne (physical, hydrological and mechanical properties of lands); and [[Lithology|lithological]] (terrain structures and types of rock).<ref name=\":3\" /> In meliorated areas migration processes are additionally influenced by anthropogenic drivers related to human agricultural activities. In this relation, specific parameters and type of drainage regime, melioration practices, water control and sprinkling can substantially accelerate natural tempos of migration of contaminants. For example, artificial drainage leads to substantial increase of absorption and flushing rates.<ref name=\":3\" /> These technological factors are particularly significant for the regions along [[Pripyat River|Pripyat river]] and [[Dnieper|Dnieper river]], which are almost totally subject to artificial irrigation and drainage within the network of constructed reservoirs and dams.\n\nAt the same time, both natural and artificial factors of migration have specific prioritization for different contaminants. The primary way of [[Strontium-90]] transportation to the groundwater is its infiltration from contaminated soils and subsequent transition through the porous surfaces of unconfined aquifer.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Chernobyl -- what have we learned? : the successes and failures to mitigate water contamination over 20 years|editor=Onishi, Yasuo|editor2=Vo\u012dt\ufe20s\ufe21ekhovich, O.

The first one is \u201ctechnogenous\u201d transition, caused by poor construction of wells for water withdrawal or insufficient quality of materials used for their shells. During electric pumping of deep-laying artesian water, the stream unprotected passes through contaminated layers of upper aquifers and absorbs radioactive particles before getting into a well. This way of contamination was experimentally verified at the [[Kiev]] water intake wells.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another abnormal way of [[radionuclide]]s migration are weak zones of crystalline rocks. The researches of Center of Radio-ecological Studies of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] showed that crustal surface has unconsolidated zones characterized by increased electric productivity, as well as higher moisture and emanation capacity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs to [[Caesium-137|Cesium-137]], this [[nuclide]] demonstrates lower migration potential in [[Chernobyl]] soils and aquifers. Its mobility is hampered by such factors as: clay minerals which fixate [[radionuclide]] in rock, absorption and neutralization of isotopes through ion-exchange with other chemical components of water; partial neutralization by vegetation metabolic cycles; overall radioactive decay.<ref name=\":2\" /> Heavy isotopes of [[Plutonium]] and [[Americium]] have even lower transportation capacity both in and outside the exclusion zone. However, their hazardous potential should not be discarded considering extremely long [[half-life]] and unpredictable geo-chemical behavior<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Agricultural damage ==\nGroundwater transportation of [[radionuclide]]s belongs to the key pathways of contamination of lands engaged in agricultural production. In particular, due to vertical migration with rises of water levels, radioactive particles infiltrate soils and subsequently get into plants through the absorption system of their roots. This leads to internal irradiation of animals and people during consumption of contaminated vegetables<ref name=\":0\" /> This situation is aggravated by a predominantly rural type of settlement in the [[Chernobyl]] area, with most of population engaged in active agricultural production. It makes the authorities either remove the contaminated areas near [[Chernoby]]l from agricultural activities or spend funds for excavation and treatment of surface layers.<ref name=\":5\" /> These problems of damage to initially intact soils puts a heavy burden primarily on Ukrainian and especially Belorussian economy. Nearly one-quarter of the entire territory of [[Belarus]] was seriously contaminated with isotopes of [[Caesium|Cesium]]. The authorities were obliged to exclude nearly 265 thousands hectares of cultivated lands from agricultural use till present day.

However, specific means of this migration still remain unknown.<ref>{{Citation|last=Van Meir|first=Nathalie|title=The Experimental Platform in Chernobyl: An International Research Polygon in the Exclusion Zone for Soil and Groundwater Contamination|date=2009|work=Radioactive Particles in the Environment|pages=197\u2013208|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048129478|last2=Buga\u00ef|first2=Dimitry|last3=Kashparov|first3=Valery|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2949-2_13}}</ref>\n\nThe researchers forecast that in case of inviolated protection of nuclear waste dumps in exclusion zone, the concentration of Strontium-90 up to 2020 will be much lower in subsurface water than admissible maximum indexes.

Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that his office has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms.

It is a small mountain town, with its main industry being [[Salt mine|salt mining]] and a nearby [[Thermal bath|spa]]. As of 2013, the town has a population of 2,607 inhabitants, while the municipality has 13,409 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], Srebrenica was the site of a [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of more than 8,000 [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys, which was subsequently designated as an act of [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman era===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in [[Salona]] in the southwest and [[Sirmium]] in the northeast using the [[Via Argentaria]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the [[Banate of Bosnia]], and, subsequently, the [[Bosnian Kingdom]].  The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region. (Compare modern [[wikt:srebro|srebro]] \"silver\".) By that time, a large number of merchants of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).<ref>Konstantin Jire\u010dek: ''Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien''. Prag: Verl. der K\u00f6n. B\u00f6hmischen Ges. der Wiss., 1879</ref> During the 14th century, many German miners moved into the area.<ref>Mihailo Dini\u0107: ''Za istoriju rudarstva u srednjevekovnoj Srbiji i Bosni'', S. 46</ref>  There were often armed conflicts about Srebrenica because of its mines. According to Czech historian [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian [[Podrinje]] and [[Usora (region)|Usora]] were part of the [[Serbian Despotate]] prior to the Ottoman conquest.<ref name=\"Kulenovi\u01071995\">{{cite book|author=Salih Kulenovi\u0107|title=Etnologija sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne: rasprave, studije, \u010dlanci|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90xAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Muzej isto\u010dne Bosne|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The [[Franciscan]] monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.<ref>''A Short History of Bosnia'', S. 53 ff.</ref>\n\nThe area of [[Osat]] was liberated for a short time during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from [[Crvica, Srebrenica|Crvica]]. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there were many atrocities committed by the [[Chetniks]] and Ustashas. Partisans fought [[Chetniks]] and [[Ustashe]] during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\n\n===Bosnian War===\n{{main article|Srebrenica massacre|Bosnian genocide}}\nThe town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River [[Drina]] separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska.<ref>http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/tol-ii050210e.htm</ref> The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\n\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and [[Siege of Srebrenica|besieged by Serb forces]]. On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations]] declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] a [[United Nations Safe Areas|UN safe area]], to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which did nothing to defend the local population. \n\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of [[\u017depa]] and [[Gora\u017ede]] were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to [[Tuzla]].\n\nThe [[Srebrenica massacre]] is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srebrenica reburies 308 victims of massacre|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25639691|date=11 July 2008|work=NBC News|accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to have been a crime of [[genocide]] (confirmed on appeal in 2004).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krstic \u2013 Judgement |url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|date=19 April 2004|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|accessdate=11 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710085141/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> This finding was upheld in 2007 by the [[International Court of Justice]].

Although guaranteed under the provisions of the Dayton Agreement, the return of survivors was repeatedly obstructed. In 2007, verbal and physical attacks on returning refugees continued to be reported in the region around Srebrenica.<ref>{{Cite web |date = 21 February 2008 |title = 7th Session of the UN Human Rights Council |work = Society for Threatened Peoples |pages = 2 |url = http://forum-menschenrechte.de/cms/upload/PDF/ab_05-2008/aides_memoires/Bosnia_Herzegowina-GfbV.pdf |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719021433/http://forum-menschenrechte.de/cms/upload/PDF/ab_05-2008/aides_memoires/Bosnia_Herzegowina-GfbV.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-date = 19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n====Fate of Bosnian Muslim villages====\nIn 1992, Bosniak villages around Srebrenica were under constant attacks by Serb forces.

Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.\"}}\n\n====British Army Documents Declassified in 2019====\n\nThe British National Archives in Kew released the documents dating back to July 1995 which deal with communication between British military and political actors during the Bosnian war. \n\nSeveral of the reports appear to blame the Bosniak Army (BiH) for provoking the Srebrenica attack. British intelligence doubted that Pale (Bosnian Serb headquarters) had any plans to overrun Srebrenica. Instead, the manoeuvre came as a response due to repeated Bosniak Army (BiH) attacks on BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) supply lines.\n\n{{quotation|The recent BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) attack on Srebrenica enclave was prompted by constant BiH (Bosniak Army) attacks over the previous 3 months on BSA supply route to the south of the enclave.

It is a small mountain town, with its main industry being [[Salt mine|salt mining]] and a nearby [[Thermal bath|spa]]. As of 2013, the town has a population of 2,607 inhabitants, while the municipality has 13,409 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]], Srebrenica was the site of a [[Srebrenica massacre|massacre]] of more than 8,000 [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] men and boys, which was subsequently designated as an act of [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman era===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, there was a settlement of Domavia, known to have been near a mine. Silver ore from there was moved to the mints in [[Salona]] in the southwest and [[Sirmium]] in the northeast using the [[Via Argentaria]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 13th and 14th century the region was part of the [[Banate of Bosnia]], and, subsequently, the [[Bosnian Kingdom]].  The earliest reference to the name Srebrenica was in 1376, by which time it was already an important centre for trade in the western Balkans, based especially on the silver mines of the region. (Compare modern [[wikt:srebro|srebro]] \"silver\".) By that time, a large number of merchants of the [[Republic of Ragusa]] were established there, and they controlled the domestic silver trade and the export by sea, almost entirely via the port of Ragusa ([[Dubrovnik]]).<ref>Konstantin Jire\u010dek: ''Die Handelsstrassen und Bergwerke von Serbien und Bosnien w\u00e4hrend des Mittelalters: historisch-geographische Studien''.

According to Czech historian [[Konstantin Josef Jire\u010dek]], from 1410 to 1460, Srebrenica switched hands several times, being Serbian five times, Bosnian four times, and Ottoman three times. The mines of Bosnian [[Podrinje]] and [[Usora (region)|Usora]] were part of the [[Serbian Despotate]] prior to the Ottoman conquest.<ref name=\"Kulenovi\u01071995\">{{cite book|author=Salih Kulenovi\u0107|title=Etnologija sjeveroisto\u010dne Bosne: rasprave, studije, \u010dlanci|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90xAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Muzej isto\u010dne Bosne|page=20}}</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\nWith the town coming under Ottoman rule, becoming less influenced by the Republic of Ragusa, the economic importance of Srebrenica went into decline, as did the proportion of Christians in the population. The [[Franciscan]] monastery was converted into a mosque, but the large number of Catholics, Ragusan and Saxon, caused the transformation of the town to Islam to be slower than in most of the other towns in the area.<ref>''A Short History of Bosnia'', S. 53 ff.</ref>\n\nThe area of [[Osat]] was liberated for a short time during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u201313), under the leadership of Kara-Marko Vasi\u0107 from [[Crvica, Srebrenica|Crvica]]. Upon the breakout of the uprising, Metropolitan Had\u017ei Melentije Stevanovi\u0107 contacted Vasi\u0107, who met with the rebel leadership. After participated in battles on the Drina (1804), Vasi\u0107 asked [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]] for an army to liberate Osat; Lazar Mutap was dispatched and the region came under rebel rule. In 1808, the Ottomans cleared out Osat, and by 1813, the rebels left the region.\n\n===Second World War===\nDuring the [[Second World War]] there were many atrocities committed by the [[Chetniks]] and Ustashas. Partisans fought [[Chetniks]] and [[Ustashe]] during the war and the people of Srebrenica built a partisan memorial cemetery monument for the fallen victims.\n\n===Bosnian War===\n{{main article|Srebrenica massacre|Bosnian genocide}}\nThe town of Srebrenica came to international prominence as a result of events during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992\u20131995). The strategic objectives proclaimed by the secessionist Bosnian Serb presidency included the creation of a border separating the Serb people from Bosnia's other ethnic communities and the abolition of the border along the River [[Drina]] separating Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs' Republika Srpska.<ref>http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/tol-ii050210e.htm</ref> The Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak majority population of the Drina Valley posed a major obstacle to the achievement of these objectives. In the early days of the campaign of forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing) that followed the outbreak of war in April 1992 the town of Srebrenica was occupied by Serb/Serbian forces. It was subsequently retaken by Bosniak resistance groups. Refugees expelled from towns and villages across the central Drina valley sought shelter in Srebrenica, swelling the town's population.\n\nThe town and its surrounding area was surrounded and [[Siege of Srebrenica|besieged by Serb forces]]. On 16 April 1993, the [[United Nations]] declared the Bosnian Muslim/Bosniak [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] a [[United Nations Safe Areas|UN safe area]], to be \"free from any armed attack or any other hostile act\", and guarded by a small Dutch unit operating under the mandate of [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which did nothing to defend the local population. \n\nSrebrenica and the other UN safe areas of [[\u017depa]] and [[Gora\u017ede]] were isolated pockets of Bosnian government-held territory in eastern Bosnia. In July 1995, despite the town's UN-protected status, it was attacked and captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]]. Following the town's capture, all men of fighting age who fell into Bosnian Serb hands were massacred in a systematically organised series of summary executions. The women of the town and men below 12 years of age and above 65 were transferred by bus to [[Tuzla]].\n\nThe [[Srebrenica massacre]] is considered the worst genocide in post-Second World War European history to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srebrenica reburies 308 victims of massacre|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25639691|date=11 July 2008|work=NBC News|accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Srebrenica massacre was determined by judgement of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) to have been a crime of [[genocide]] (confirmed on appeal in 2004).<ref>{{cite web|title=Krstic \u2013 Judgement |url=https://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|date=19 April 2004|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]|accessdate=11 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710085141/http://www.un.org/icty/krstic/Appeal/judgement/index.htm|archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> This finding was upheld in 2007 by the [[International Court of Justice]].

Each onslaught followed a similar pattern. Serb soldiers and paramilitaries surrounded a Bosnian Muslim village or hamlet, called upon the population to surrender their weapons, and then began with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. In most cases, they then entered the village or hamlet, expelled or killed the population, who offered no significant resistance and destroyed their homes. During this period, Srebrenica was subjected to indiscriminate shelling from all directions on a daily basis. Poto\u010dari in particular was a daily target for Serb artillery and infantry because it was a sensitive point in the defence line around Srebrenica. Other Bosnian Muslim settlements were routinely attacked as well. All this resulted in a great number of refugees and casualties.\"}}\n\n====British Army Documents Declassified in 2019====\n\nThe British National Archives in Kew released the documents dating back to July 1995 which deal with communication between British military and political actors during the Bosnian war. \n\nSeveral of the reports appear to blame the Bosniak Army (BiH) for provoking the Srebrenica attack. British intelligence doubted that Pale (Bosnian Serb headquarters) had any plans to overrun Srebrenica. Instead, the manoeuvre came as a response due to repeated Bosniak Army (BiH) attacks on BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) supply lines.\n\n{{quotation|The recent BSA (Bosnian Serb Army) attack on Srebrenica enclave was prompted by constant BiH (Bosniak Army) attacks over the previous 3 months on BSA supply route to the south of the enclave. The BSA attacks are almost certainly initiated by the local commander and we don't think they are part of a Pale (Bosnian Serb Army headquarters) inspired plan to overrun the enclave.<ref name=\"PREM 19/5487\">{{cite web |title=YUGOSLAVIA.

It intends to simplify the build language as compared to MSBuild scripting.<ref>ASP.NET - Topshelf and Katana: A Unified Web and Service Architecture ; MSDN Magazine June 2014  ; https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn745865.aspx</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nA build script consists of Tasks. Each Task is a function that can define dependencies on other Task functions.\n\nThe following is an example psake script:\n\n<source lang=\"powershell\">\nTask default -Depends Build\n\nTask Build -Depends Init,Clean,Compile {\n   \"build\"\n}\n\nTask Compile -Depends Clean, Init {\n   \"compile\"\n}\n\nTask Clean -Depends Init {\n   \"clean\"\n}\n\nTask Init {\n   \"init\"\n}\n</source>\n\npsake executes the Task functions and enforces the dependencies between tasks. Since psake is written in a real programming language and not [[XML]], you have a lot more freedom and flexibility in your build scripts.
