Chu]], from a screenplay by Peter Chiarelli and [[Adele Lim]], based on the [[Crazy Rich Asians|2013 novel of the same title]] by [[Kevin Kwan]]. The film stars [[Constance Wu]], [[Henry Golding]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Lisa Lu]], [[Awkwafina]], [[Ken Jeong]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]]. It follows a [[Chinese Americans|Chinese-American]] professor who travels to meet her boyfriend's family and is surprised to discover they are among the richest in [[Singapore]].\n\nThe film was announced in August 2013 after the rights to the book were purchased. Many of the cast members signed on in the spring of 2017, and filming took place from April to June of that year in parts of [[New York City]] and [[Singapore]]. It is the first film by a [[major film studio|major Hollywood studio]] to feature a majority cast of Asian descent in a modern setting since ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' in 1993.<!--(Memoirs of a Geisha was a period piece)--> Despite praise for that, the film did receive some criticism for casting [[biracial]] actors over [[Overseas Chinese|fully ethnically Chinese]] ones in certain roles. Additional criticism was directed at the film for failing to include non-Chinese Singaporean ethnic groups\u2014notably [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] actors\u2014as characters.\n\n''Crazy Rich Asians'' premiered on August 7, 2018, at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, production and costume design. The film grossed over $238 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy in a decade. The film received numerous accolades, including the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] earning nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for Wu. It also received four nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], winning one for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy|Best Comedy]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. Two sequels, based on the novel's follow-ups ''[[China Rich Girlfriend]]'' and ''[[Rich People Problems]]'', are currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Young and his girlfriend Rachel Chu, an [[economics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[New York City|New York]] native, travel to [[Singapore]] for the wedding of his best friend Colin, who is marrying Araminta Lee. In Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin and her family, who are shocked when she tells them she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin reveals that Nick's family is extremely wealthy and famous, and are members of high society. At a dinner party at the Young estate, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother Eleanor, while his cousin Astrid discovers that her husband Michael, who comes from a more humble background than the Youngs, has been having an affair. Rachel senses that Eleanor dislikes her.\n\nAt Araminta's [[bachelorette party]], Rachel meets Amanda, who reveals she is Nick's former girlfriend and hints Rachel may not be able to integrate into such a high-class family with her lower background. Rachel finds her hotel room vandalized by the other girls, who deem her a gold-digger, but is comforted by Astrid. Nick attends Colin's [[bachelor party]], where he reveals to Colin his plan to propose to Rachel. Colin expresses his concern about the trouble it will cause them, especially with Nick being expected to stay in Singapore and run his family's corporation and Rachel loving her job in New York, as well as the difference in their statuses. Nick apologizes to Rachel for not telling her who he really was and takes her to make [[jiaozi]] dumplings with his family. Here, Eleanor recounts the sacrifices she made to become a part of the Young family and makes jabs at Rachel for her American background. Eleanor later privately recounts to Rachel how Nick's father had to cast his own green ring to propose to her as Nick's grandmother refused to give him the family ring, owing to Eleanor not being the first or even second choice. She tells Rachel that she will never be enough for Nick or his family. Peik Lin convinces Rachel to stand up to Eleanor and earns her respect. On the day of the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair; Michael blames his unhappiness and the great financial disparity between them on her.\n\nDuring the wedding reception, Eleanor and Nick's grandmother privately confront Rachel and Nick. Using the findings of a private investigation, Eleanor reveals that Rachel's father is alive, and Rachel was conceived through an adulterous affair, after which her mother, Kerry, abandoned her husband and fled to the United States. They demand that Nick stop seeing Rachel for fear of a scandal, as they cannot be linked to such a family. Rachel is stunned, as Kerry told her that her father was dead. She flees and stays at Peik Lin's home, depressed and unwilling to speak to Nick. Kerry arrives in Singapore, explaining that her husband was abusive and that the comfort an old classmate provided turned into love and a surprise pregnancy. She fled with baby Rachel in fear that her husband would kill them. Kerry reveals that Nick was the one who had called her to Singapore and urges Rachel to talk to him. When they meet, Nick apologizes and proposes to Rachel, saying that he is willing to leave his family behind to be with her.\n\nRachel arranges to meet Eleanor at a [[mahjong]] parlor. Over a game of mahjong, she reveals to Eleanor that she declined Nick's proposal so his relationship with his family would not be ruined. She tells Eleanor to remember that when Nick eventually marries someone \"good enough\" for her, it will be because of a selfless act on the part of Rachel, a girl Eleanor looks down upon. Meanwhile, Astrid moves out, telling Michael his ego, insecurities, and unwillingness to make their marriage work caused it to fail. Elsewhere Eleanor has a meeting with Nick.\n\nRachel and Kerry board a flight back to New York City at [[Singapore Changi Airport]], but are interrupted by Nick, who proposes with Eleanor's green ring, revealing her blessing. In tears, Rachel accepts and they stay in Singapore one more night for an engagement party, where Eleanor nods at Rachel in acknowledgment, Rachel having finally earned her respect. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Astrid and her ex-boyfriend Charlie Wu spot each other at the party; she discreetly smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple

Chu]], from a screenplay by Peter Chiarelli and [[Adele Lim]], based on the [[Crazy Rich Asians|2013 novel of the same title]] by [[Kevin Kwan]]. The film stars [[Constance Wu]], [[Henry Golding]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Lisa Lu]], [[Awkwafina]], [[Ken Jeong]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]]. It follows a [[Chinese Americans|Chinese-American]] professor who travels to meet her boyfriend's family and is surprised to discover they are among the richest in [[Singapore]].\n\nThe film was announced in August 2013 after the rights to the book were purchased. Many of the cast members signed on in the spring of 2017, and filming took place from April to June of that year in parts of [[New York City]] and [[Singapore]]. It is the first film by a [[major film studio|major Hollywood studio]] to feature a majority cast of Asian descent in a modern setting since ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' in 1993.<!--(Memoirs of a Geisha was a period piece)--> Despite praise for that, the film did receive some criticism for casting [[biracial]] actors over [[Overseas Chinese|fully ethnically Chinese]] ones in certain roles. Additional criticism was directed at the film for failing to include non-Chinese Singaporean ethnic groups\u2014notably [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] actors\u2014as characters.\n\n''Crazy Rich Asians'' premiered on August 7, 2018, at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, production and costume design. The film grossed over $238 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy in a decade. The film received numerous accolades, including the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] earning nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for Wu. It also received four nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], winning one for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy|Best Comedy]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. Two sequels, based on the novel's follow-ups ''[[China Rich Girlfriend]]'' and ''[[Rich People Problems]]'', are currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Young and his girlfriend Rachel Chu, an [[economics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[New York City|New York]] native, travel to [[Singapore]] for the wedding of his best friend Colin, who is marrying Araminta Lee. In Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin and her family, who are shocked when she tells them she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin reveals that Nick's family is extremely wealthy and famous, and are members of high society. At a dinner party at the Young estate, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother Eleanor, while his cousin Astrid discovers that her husband Michael, who comes from a more humble background than the Youngs, has been having an affair. Rachel senses that Eleanor dislikes her.\n\nAt Araminta's [[bachelorette party]], Rachel meets Amanda, who reveals she is Nick's former girlfriend and hints Rachel may not be able to integrate into such a high-class family with her lower background. Rachel finds her hotel room vandalized by the other girls, who deem her a gold-digger, but is comforted by Astrid. Nick attends Colin's [[bachelor party]], where he reveals to Colin his plan to propose to Rachel. Colin expresses his concern about the trouble it will cause them, especially with Nick being expected to stay in Singapore and run his family's corporation and Rachel loving her job in New York, as well as the difference in their statuses. Nick apologizes to Rachel for not telling her who he really was and takes her to make [[jiaozi]] dumplings with his family. Here, Eleanor recounts the sacrifices she made to become a part of the Young family and makes jabs at Rachel for her American background. Eleanor later privately recounts to Rachel how Nick's father had to cast his own green ring to propose to her as Nick's grandmother refused to give him the family ring, owing to Eleanor not being the first or even second choice. She tells Rachel that she will never be enough for Nick or his family. Peik Lin convinces Rachel to stand up to Eleanor and earns her respect. On the day of the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair; Michael blames his unhappiness and the great financial disparity between them on her.\n\nDuring the wedding reception, Eleanor and Nick's grandmother privately confront Rachel and Nick. Using the findings of a private investigation, Eleanor reveals that Rachel's father is alive, and Rachel was conceived through an adulterous affair, after which her mother, Kerry, abandoned her husband and fled to the United States. They demand that Nick stop seeing Rachel for fear of a scandal, as they cannot be linked to such a family. Rachel is stunned, as Kerry told her that her father was dead. She flees and stays at Peik Lin's home, depressed and unwilling to speak to Nick. Kerry arrives in Singapore, explaining that her husband was abusive and that the comfort an old classmate provided turned into love and a surprise pregnancy. She fled with baby Rachel in fear that her husband would kill them. Kerry reveals that Nick was the one who had called her to Singapore and urges Rachel to talk to him. When they meet, Nick apologizes and proposes to Rachel, saying that he is willing to leave his family behind to be with her.\n\nRachel arranges to meet Eleanor at a [[mahjong]] parlor. Over a game of mahjong, she reveals to Eleanor that she declined Nick's proposal so his relationship with his family would not be ruined. She tells Eleanor to remember that when Nick eventually marries someone \"good enough\" for her, it will be because of a selfless act on the part of Rachel, a girl Eleanor looks down upon. Meanwhile, Astrid moves out, telling Michael his ego, insecurities, and unwillingness to make their marriage work caused it to fail. Elsewhere Eleanor has a meeting with Nick.\n\nRachel and Kerry board a flight back to New York City at [[Singapore Changi Airport]], but are interrupted by Nick, who proposes with Eleanor's green ring, revealing her blessing. In tears, Rachel accepts and they stay in Singapore one more night for an engagement party, where Eleanor nods at Rachel in acknowledgment, Rachel having finally earned her respect. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Astrid and her ex-boyfriend Charlie Wu spot each other at the party; she discreetly smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple

Through her work she creates what she calls \"anthropomorphic individuals.\" Although abstract and formal, she feels they have human-like aspects within their minimal state, made of simple line and gesture. In reference to her minimalist paintings, Louden has been called \"the Robert Ryman of the 21st century.\"<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E6DD123EF931A25751C0A9609C8B63</ref>\n\nLouden has become known for her large-scale installations using aluminum in both public and museum forums. Upon completion of an exhibition of suspended aluminum in early 2017 entitled, \"Windows,\" at the [[Tweed Museum of Art]],<ref>https://www.d.umn.edu/tma/exhibitions/Sharon_Louden_2015/Louden2015.html</ref> she was commissioned for a permanent installation using suspended aluminum in the lobby of a public building in Houston, TX. Subsequent iterations of \"Windows\" were completed at the University of Wyoming Museum of Art (2018-2020) <ref>http://www.uwyo.edu/artmuseum/exhibitions/current/transforming-spaces/index.html</ref>, [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] (2019-2020) <ref>https://philbrook.org/exhibitions/sharon-louden/</ref>, and a permanent installation in the lobby of a new building in Oklahoma City, OK. \n\nIn October 2011, Louden's installation ''Merge'' opened at the [[Weisman Art Museum]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<ref>http://weisman.umn.edu/event/sympathies</ref> ''Merge'' was created in dialogue with the Frank Gehry designed new addition to the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, MN. The first iteration of ''Merge'' was exhibited at the Munson Williams Proctor Institute Museum of Art in 2004<ref>https://static1.squarespace.com/static/592b51c18419c2e1dd15123b/t/5a31c0c5c830251c926fe1c9/1513210058292/2004_DimensionalLine-sm.pdf</ref> and evolved since then. Of ''Merge'', Janet Koplos of ''Art in America'' writes \"...the energetic ''Merge'', perhaps Louden\u2019s best work to date, clearly succeeds on its own merits and would be satisfying anywhere.\"<ref>http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/sharon-louden/</ref>\n\nLouden's work is held in major public and private collections including the Whitney Museum of American Art, National Gallery of Art, Neuberger Museum of Art, Arkansas Arts Center, Yale University Art Gallery, Weatherspoon Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, among others. She has received a grants from the Elizabeth Foundation, [[New York Foundation for the Arts]], and the [[Ford Foundation]] and has participated in residencies at the [[Tamarind Institute]], Urban Glass, [[Omi International Arts Center|Art Omi]], and The Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation.<ref>https://www.sharonlouden.com/resume/</ref>\n\nHer work is represented by [http://www.signsandsymbols.art Signs & Symbols Gallery] in New York City,<ref>http://www.signsandsymbols.art/artists</ref> [https://www.patrickheide.com Patrick Heide Contemporary Art] in London,<ref>https://www.patrickheide.com/artists/collaborating</ref> and [https://hollyjohnsongallery.com Holly Johnson Gallery] in Dallas, TX.<ref>https://hollyjohnsongallery.com/exhibition/75/exhibition_works/945</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSharon Louden was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and raised in [[Olney, Maryland]].

Inspired by many artists, including Shel Silverstein, animation has become an important aspect to the development of Louden's overall visual language.\n\nHer first series of animations were included in a 2006 solo exhibition entitled \"Character,\" which was a survey of paintings, drawings, installation, prints and animation at the Neuberger Museum of Art, curated by Dede Young. Also in 2006, \"Pool\" was included in the Art Video Lounge exhibition curated by Michael Rush for the Art Basel Miami Art Fair. Since then, Louden has continued making animations, including her latest - \"Untitled (in dialogue with Len Lye, \"Free Radicals\")\" completed in 2017.\n\nMany of her animations were surveyed in various children's film festivals in the US in 2008-2009. In particular, \"The Bridge,\" completed in 2008, was shown at the Birmingham Museum of Art, Weatherspoon Art Museum, Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University and Gallery Joe in Philadelphia, PA. It was also screened at the Queens International Film Festival and the New York Downtown Film Festival Audience Choice Screening in 2009. Because of positive audience response at the screening, \"The Bridge\" was selected for inclusion in the New York Downtown Film Festival in 2010. Her animations have also been shown in many more film festivals nationally and abroad, including the Athens International Film and Video Festival in Athens, OH and the Honolulu International Film Festival, where she received an award for Excellence in Filmmaking in 2009. In 2010, Louden was the recipient of the Bronze Palm Award from the Mexico International Film Festival for \"The Bridge.\"\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, Louden was commissioned by the [[National Gallery of Art]] to both create new animations and to help curate three film screenings of abstract animation: ''Cin\u00e9-Concert: Art in Motion!'' (2011), ''Cin\u00e9-Concert: Abstract Film Since 1970'' (2013), and ''Cin\u00e9-Concert: Contemporary Experiments in Animation'' (2017).

Through her work she creates what she calls \"anthropomorphic individuals.\" Although abstract and formal, she feels they have human-like aspects within their minimal state, made of simple line and gesture. In reference to her minimalist paintings, Louden has been called \"the Robert Ryman of the 21st century.\"<ref>https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E6DD123EF931A25751C0A9609C8B63</ref>\n\nLouden has become known for her large-scale installations using aluminum in both public and museum forums.

Inspired by many artists, including Shel Silverstein, animation has become an important aspect to the development of Louden's overall visual language.\n\nHer first series of animations were included in a 2006 solo exhibition entitled \"Character,\" which was a survey of paintings, drawings, installation, prints and animation at the Neuberger Museum of Art, curated by Dede Young. Also in 2006, \"Pool\" was included in the Art Video Lounge exhibition curated by Michael Rush for the Art Basel Miami Art Fair. Since then, Louden has continued making animations, including her latest - \"Untitled (in dialogue with Len Lye, \"Free Radicals\")\" completed in 2017.\n\nMany of her animations were surveyed in various children's film festivals in the US in 2008-2009. In particular, \"The Bridge,\" completed in 2008, was shown at the Birmingham Museum of Art, Weatherspoon Art Museum, Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University and Gallery Joe in Philadelphia, PA.

Sometimes you hear it on the streets or someone has it on their mobile phone or something\u2026 it's a nice feeling! Actually, I did an interview about a year ago with a newspaper from America and they talked about how much it's been used in sports in America\u2026 which I didn't know so much about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, and it turned out to be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but when we play it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it.<ref name=\"INT\">{{cite web|first= David |last= Felix |title= Interview with Joey Tempest (Lead Vocals \u2013 Europe) |date= 14 April 2005 |publisher= Rock Eyez |url= http://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-europe.html |accessdate= 24 June 2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 2009, Tempest told the BBC's Liam Allen, \"I can trace bands like [[UFO (band)|UFO]] in it, sort of a galloping theme like [[Iron Maiden]] had on ''The Number of the Beast'' album on quite a few songs.

Sometimes you hear it on the streets or someone has it on their mobile phone or something\u2026 it's a nice feeling! Actually, I did an interview about a year ago with a newspaper from America and they talked about how much it's been used in sports in America\u2026 which I didn't know so much about. Apparently it has been used a lot and it was nice to hear. The ironic thing, though, is that the song was actually written for the fans. It was over six minutes long and was never meant to be a hit or anything like that. It was meant to be an opening for the 'live' show. We were putting out our third album and we wanted a really 'grand' opening for the show. So, I had that 'riff' tucked away in a drawer since my college years and I took it out, found a tempo for it, wrote lyrics, and it turned out to be a great opening for that album and for the show, as well. Nowadays, we don't rehearse it, but when we play it live, it is still just so amazing! It does communicate so well with the audience and we really love playing it.<ref name=\"INT\">{{cite web|first= David |last= Felix |title= Interview with Joey Tempest (Lead Vocals \u2013 Europe) |date= 14 April 2005 |publisher= Rock Eyez |url= http://www.rockeyez.com/interviews/int-europe.html |accessdate= 24 June 2008}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 2009, Tempest told the BBC's Liam Allen, \"I can trace bands like [[UFO (band)|UFO]] in it, sort of a galloping theme like [[Iron Maiden]] had on ''The Number of the Beast'' album on quite a few songs.

A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind. A port for [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in August 2012, which featured additional content not seen in the original [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions. In October 2012, the new content was made [[downloadable content|downloadable]] for consoles, under the subtitle ''[[Artorias of the Abyss]]''.\n\n''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim, with many citing it as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate [[level design]], and use of [[flavor text]]. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for being too unforgiving. The original Windows version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. The game saw two sequels released in the mid-2010s, while a remastered version, ''[[#Dark Souls: Remastered|Dark Souls: Remastered]]'', was released in 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. A core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). The [[player character]] can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825175549/http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |archive-date=August 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA central element to the gameplay of ''Dark Souls'' is the [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|bonfire]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their \"Estus Flask.\" They can also [[Level up (video gaming)|level up]] and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire [[respawn]]s all of the world's enemies, except for bosses and friendly non-playable characters.\n[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[player character]] (right) battles Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' [[downloadable content]] expansion]]\n\nThe player character's interaction with the world of ''Dark Souls'' includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of [[high fantasy]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-style weaponry\u2014including [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and more\u2014as well as imaginary, fantastical weaponry\u2014including magical swords, humongous greatswords, and immense clubs. For defense, player characters have access to [[shield]]s, [[Armour|armor]], dodge rolling, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]]. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of [[Magic (gaming)|mana]] as in most other fantasy RPGs - instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated with them; and they can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through leveling, [[Metalsmith|smithing]], consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nAnother aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the \"humanity\" system. There are two forms the player character can be in during the game, human form or hollow form. Whenever the player character dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item. The player character must be in human form to summon other players. While in human form, however, the player may be subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player to restore their humanity, harvest souls, or achieve some other goal. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form.\n\nDeath (whether in human or hollow form) results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \"bloodstain,\" the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\n\nCommunication and interaction between players are deliberately restricted. Outside of five stock phrases (which can only be used after acquiring Gough's carvings in the game's DLC) and character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. Also, players can enter [[cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not essential. If the player does choose to engage with them, some of the characters can assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights when the player character is in human form.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Dark Souls'' employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from [[non-player character]]s within the game, [[flavor text]] from items, and world design.\n\nThe opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world during the \"Age of Ancients.\" A primordial fire known as the First Flame manifests in the world, establishing a distinction between life and death, as well as light and dark. Four beings find \"Lord Souls\" near the First Flame, granting immense power: Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight, Nito the First of the Dead, the Witch of Izalith, and the Furtive Pygmy. Gwyn, Nito, and the Witch use their new power to destroy the dragons and take control over the world, while the Furtive Pygmy is said to be forgotten, and this begins the \"Age of Fire.\" Over time, the First Flame begins to fade while humans rise in power, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. The main story takes place towards the end of this second Age of Fire, at which point humanity is said to be afflicted with an undead curse, related to a symbol on their bodies known as the Darksign. Those humans afflicted with the undead curse perpetually resurrect after death, until they eventually lose their minds, a process referred to as \"hollowing.\"\n\nThe player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo, the home of the Gods. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the player must aquire the Lord Souls of the Witch of Izalith, Nito, the Four Kings, and Seath the Scaleless. Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player has the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\n\n=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===\n{{main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}\nIn the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' expansion, the player is dragged into the past by the Manus, Father of the Abyss to the land to Oolacile, which is being corrupted by Manus after the people awoke and angered him. Artorias, one of Lord Gwyn's four knights goes to defeat Manus and rescue the Princess Dusk. Artorias is defeated and corrupted by the abyss, however, and the player must defeat him. The player than goes on to defeat Manus, although the victory is attributed to Artorias later, creating a paradox.\n\n== Development ==\n''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. ''Dark Souls'' is a [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's [[cult classic]] previous game, ''[[Demon's Souls]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/souls/3025-2169/|title=Souls - Overview|website=Giant Bomb|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref> (which was, in turn, a spiritual successor to From's earlier ''[[King's Field]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|title=Demon\u2019s Souls Director Discusses Difficulty, Sequels, And More|last=Kollar|first=Phil|date=November 5, 2009|website=gameinformer|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>). However, ''Demon's Souls'' was published by Sony and ''Dark Souls'' by [[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Bandai Namco]]; this transfer meant that intellectual property rights prevented FromSoftware from making a sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4424550/demons-souls-2-shuhei-yoshida-e3|title=Sony studios head wants to see more Demon's Souls|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=June 13, 2013|website=Polygon|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"lee et al\">{{cite journal | title = Relationships among video games: Existing standards and new definitions | author = Jin Ha Lee |first2=Rachel Ivy |last2=Clarke |first3=Simone |last3=Sacchi |first4=Jacob |last4=Jett | journal = Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | year = 2014 | pages = 1\u201311 | doi = 10.1002/meet.2014.14505101035 }}</ref> After two years of development, ''Dark Souls'' was released with its numerous similarities (such as the gameplay, online multiplayer, and plot presentation) and differences (such as a connected world and new characters in a distinct universe and storyline) from its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cgmagonline.com/2016/05/30/dark-souls-history-bloodborne-fromsoftware-ps4-playstation-pc/|title=Prepare To Die: A Brief History Of The Souls Series|last=Gilyadov|first=Aleksander|date=May 30, 2016|website=CGMagazine|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe design and development process itself involved a guided freeform approach, with Miyazaki steering designers while allowing them latitude for creativity:<blockquote>The design ordering process for ''Dark Souls'' can be divided into two main categories. The first involves providing the designers with simple keywords we brainstormed during the early stages of project development and allowing them to design freely. We take the images they produce and provide feedback, make adjustments as necessary, or incorporate their ideas into our plans. [...] The second process comes into play once we've settled on the basic details of the game world. At that point we are able to make more detailed design requests.

A [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', the game is the second instalment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a [[pilgrimage]] to discover the fate of their kind. A port for [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in August 2012, which featured additional content not seen in the original [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions. In October 2012, the new content was made [[downloadable content|downloadable]] for consoles, under the subtitle ''[[Artorias of the Abyss]]''.\n\n''Dark Souls'' received critical acclaim, with many citing it as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Critics praising the depth of its combat, intricate [[level design]], and use of [[flavor text]]. However, the game's difficulty received mixed reviews, with some criticizing it for being too unforgiving. The original Windows version of the game was less well-received, with criticism directed at numerous technical issues. By April 2013, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. The game saw two sequels released in the mid-2010s, while a remastered version, ''[[#Dark Souls: Remastered|Dark Souls: Remastered]]'', was released in 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Dark Souls'' is a third-person [[action role-playing game]]. A core mechanic of the game is exploration. Players are encouraged by the game to proceed with caution, learn from past mistakes, or find alternative areas to explore. ''Dark Souls'' takes place in a large and continuous [[open world]] environment, connected through a central hub area (Firelink Shrine). The [[player character]] can travel between areas and explore various paths at will, although prerequisites have to be met to unlock certain areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-brick-walls-and-pancakes/ |title=Dark Souls review: Brick walls and pancakes |work=Engadget |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Richard |last=Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review |title=Dark Souls Review |work=IGN |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_souls/b/ps3/archive/2011/10/03/dark-souls-review-dead-and-loving-it.aspx |title=Dark Souls Review: Dead And Loving It |work=GameInformer.com |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Phil |last=Kollar}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |title=Dark Souls Review |work=Game Revolution |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |first=Daniel |last=Bischoff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825175549/http://m.gamerevolution.com/review/dark-souls |archive-date=August 25, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA central element to the gameplay of ''Dark Souls'' is the [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|bonfire]]. Bonfires are scattered throughout the world and serve as checkpoints for each level. By resting at a bonfire, the player character is healed to full and regains all of the healing charges of their \"Estus Flask.\" They can also [[Level up (video gaming)|level up]] and perform other functions, such as attuning magic, and repairing and upgrading equipment. However, resting at a bonfire [[respawn]]s all of the world's enemies, except for bosses and friendly non-playable characters.\n[[File:Darksoulsbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[player character]] (right) battles Artorias, one of the bosses added to the game through the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' [[downloadable content]] expansion]]\n\nThe player character's interaction with the world of ''Dark Souls'' includes a great deal of combat. Combat includes [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks, various forms of defensive maneuvering, and magical abilities. For melee attacks, player characters have access to a wide array of [[high fantasy]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-style weaponry\u2014including [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Mace (bludgeon)|maces]], and more\u2014as well as imaginary, fantastical weaponry\u2014including magical swords, humongous greatswords, and immense clubs. For defense, player characters have access to [[shield]]s, [[Armour|armor]], dodge rolling, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]]. For magic, which includes a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities known as sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies, player characters do not use any form of [[Magic (gaming)|mana]] as in most other fantasy RPGs - instead, they gain a discrete number of uses for each attuned spell when resting at a bonfire. These various forms of combat all have tradeoffs, variations, and in-game costs associated with them; and they can all be buffed or altered in some fashion through leveling, [[Metalsmith|smithing]], consumable items, magical rings, and new equipment.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nAnother aspect of ''Dark Souls'' is the \"humanity\" system. There are two forms the player character can be in during the game, human form or hollow form. Whenever the player character dies in human form, they are returned to hollow form and can only have their humanity restored by consuming an item. The player character must be in human form to summon other players. While in human form, however, the player may be subjected to invasions by other players and [[non-player character]]s (NPC) who seek to kill the player to restore their humanity, harvest souls, or achieve some other goal. Humanity can be acquired in many ways, and if no humanity is available, players are still able to progress in hollow form.\n\nDeath (whether in human or hollow form) results in the loss of all carried souls and humanity, but players revive as hollows at their most recent bonfire with one chance at returning to where they died to recover all lost souls and humanity. If the player dies before reaching their \"bloodstain,\" the souls and humanity they previously accrued are permanently lost.\n\nCommunication and interaction between players are deliberately restricted. Outside of five stock phrases (which can only be used after acquiring Gough's carvings in the game's DLC) and character gestures, the only other communication players have with one another comes by way of orange [[soapstone]]s, which allow players to write limited messages that can be read by others in the same area. Also, players can enter [[cooperative]] or [[player versus player]] combat with each other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-pvp-keeping-game-alive/|title=The rituals, strategies, honour and etiquette that keep Dark Souls PvP alive|last=Ahmed|first=Sayem|date=August 26, 2015|work=Future Publishing Limited Quay House|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/news/master-online-play-vaativiyda|title=Master Online play|last=Entertainment|first=Bandai|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the game, there are multiple NPCs that the player may encounter on their journey. These characters add to the plot of the game but are not essential. If the player does choose to engage with them, some of the characters can assist the player by being able to be summoned for certain boss fights when the player character is in human form.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Dark Souls'' employs minimalist storytelling to convey its plot and lore. Historical events in its world and their significance are often implicit or left to player interpretation rather than being fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from [[non-player character]]s within the game, [[flavor text]] from items, and world design.\n\nThe opening cutscene establishes the premise of the game. Dragons once ruled the world during the \"Age of Ancients.\" A primordial fire known as the First Flame manifests in the world, establishing a distinction between life and death, as well as light and dark. Four beings find \"Lord Souls\" near the First Flame, granting immense power: Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight, Nito the First of the Dead, the Witch of Izalith, and the Furtive Pygmy. Gwyn, Nito, and the Witch use their new power to destroy the dragons and take control over the world, while the Furtive Pygmy is said to be forgotten, and this begins the \"Age of Fire.\" Over time, the First Flame begins to fade while humans rise in power, and Gwyn sacrifices himself to prolong the Age of Fire. The main story takes place towards the end of this second Age of Fire, at which point humanity is said to be afflicted with an undead curse, related to a symbol on their bodies known as the Darksign. Those humans afflicted with the undead curse perpetually resurrect after death, until they eventually lose their minds, a process referred to as \"hollowing.\"\n\nThe player character is a cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum. After escaping the asylum, the player travels to Lordran to ring the Bells of Awakening. The bells awaken Kingseeker Frampt, who tells the player to ascend to Anor Londo, the home of the Gods. In Anor Londo, Gwynevere instructs the player to succeed Lord Gwyn and fulfill the prophecy. To accomplish this, the player must aquire the Lord Souls of the Witch of Izalith, Nito, the Four Kings, and Seath the Scaleless. Optionally, the player may encounter Darkstalker Kaathe who encourages the player not to link the fire but to let it die out and usher in the Age of Dark instead. Once the player acquires the Lord Souls, they travel to the Kiln of the First Flame to battle Gwyn. Once Gwyn has been defeated, the player has the choice of linking the flame to preserve the Age of Fire, or letting it die out to instigate the Age of Dark.\n\n=== ''Artorias of the Abyss'' ===\n{{main|Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss}}\nIn the ''Artorias of the Abyss'' expansion, the player is dragged into the past by the Manus, Father of the Abyss to the land to Oolacile, which is being corrupted by Manus after the people awoke and angered him. Artorias, one of Lord Gwyn's four knights goes to defeat Manus and rescue the Princess Dusk. Artorias is defeated and corrupted by the abyss, however, and the player must defeat him. The player than goes on to defeat Manus, although the victory is attributed to Artorias later, creating a paradox.\n\n== Development ==\n''Dark Souls'' was developed by [[FromSoftware]], with series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] directing and producing. ''Dark Souls'' is a [[spiritual successor]] to FromSoftware's [[cult classic]] previous game, ''[[Demon's Souls]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/souls/3025-2169/|title=Souls - Overview|website=Giant Bomb|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref> (which was, in turn, a spiritual successor to From's earlier ''[[King's Field]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx|title=Demon\u2019s Souls Director Discusses Difficulty, Sequels, And More|last=Kollar|first=Phil|date=November 5, 2009|website=gameinformer|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>).

The first involves providing the designers with simple keywords we brainstormed during the early stages of project development and allowing them to design freely. We take the images they produce and provide feedback, make adjustments as necessary, or incorporate their ideas into our plans. [...] The second process comes into play once we've settled on the basic details of the game world. At that point we are able to make more detailed design requests.

This caused a dilemma for the Xhosa King as it meant that if he chose either of them, the father of the unpicked bride would be offended and possibly the relations would be strained between the two tribes from such an offence.\n\nXhosa elders and all the known wise men who knew the Xhosa laws & customs across Xhosa land were summoned to ''Komkhulu'' (The great place - in the present day town of Butterworth) to solve this problem. It has been said in the Xhosa oral history that, it was one old man by the name of ''Majeke'' who came with a solution to that problem. His solution was: ''\"What is greater than the head of the king, and what is stronger than his right hand? Let the one be the head wife and the other the wife of the right hand\".''
