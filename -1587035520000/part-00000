Ponnazhagi Naachiyar ([[Srividya]]) is a [[Gram panchayat|panchayathu]] chief since the death of her husband Ramadurai ([[Ravichandran (Tamil actor)|Ravichandran]]), she has two sons : the elder Kathirvel ([[Radha Ravi]]) is an uneducated brute who woos his relative Shenbagam whereas Chinnadurai ([[Ponvannan]]) studies in the city.\n\nOne day, at the village court, a poor woman claims that the rich Sidambaram ([[R. K. (actor)|R. K]]) and she are in love with each other and she is now pregnant. Ponnazhagi clears Sidambaram due to a lack of evidence and states that the poor woman is greedy. The poor woman later tries to commit suicide but the kind-hearted Rajadurai ([[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]]) saves her on time. Rajadurai later beats up Sidambaram and he admits its mistake, so Rajadurai arranges their wedding, dismissing Ponnazhagi's judgement. Rajadurai was adopted and brought up by the Muslim man Rowther ([[V. K. Ramaswamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]]).\n\nThereafter, Shenbagam's sister Mallika ([[Anusha (actress)|Anusha]]) reaches puberty. Kathirvel, who was supposed to arrange the puberty ceremony as per the custom, is in the city with his brother Chinnadurai. Considering the circumstances, Rajadurai arranges the ceremony. When Kathirvel becomes aware of this matter, Kathirvel and Rajadurai fight. Kathirvel then threatens Shenbagam and Mallika to kill them if the two sisters break the village customs once again. Shenbagam cannot bear Kathirvel's mental torture so Rajadurai promises Shenbagam he will marry her. Ponnazhagi who expected her son Chinnadurai to be a kind-hearted person is, in fact, a rude womanizer. Ponnazhagi decides to let her son become the panchayat chief all the same but during the ceremony of the transfer of power, Rowther claims that Rajadurai is the only one who can be the next panchayat chief and then Rajadurai's mother Parvathi ([[Bharathi Vishnuvardhan]]) arrives determined to confirm it.\n\nMany years back, the panchayat chief Ramadurai ([[Ravichandran (Tamil actor)|Ravichandran]]) and Parvathi were a happily married couple and lived with their baby son Rajadurai. One day, Parvathi caught her husband Ramadurai and his relative Ponnazhagi having sex. So Parvathi arranged the wedding between Ramadurai and Ponnazhagi, she then left his home with her son. Yet shortly before Ramadurai died, Ramadurai whispered \"Parvathi\" multiple times in his bed, it irked Ponnazhagi. The villagers went to Parvathi's house to inform her about this. There, a half naked-man ran away from the house. The villagers suspected the innocent Parvathi for having an affair with another man and locked her in her house until the end of the death ceremony. Later, Ponnazhagi plotted to kill Parvathi and Rajadurai. Rowther then adopted Rajadurai and Parvathi disappeared. Rowther and Rajadurai left the village and then came back many years later. It is later revealed that Kathirvel was adopted and he was the son of the man who ran away from Parvathi's house.\n\nBack to the present, the villagers support Rajadurai who is the first son of Ramadurai. Afterwards, Kathirvel and Chinnadurai attempt to murder their mother Ponnazhagi and want to blame the innocent Rajadurai, but Rajadurai saves Ponnazhagi on time. Ponnazhagi then realises her sins and apologizes to Rajadurai and Parvathi in front of the villagers. Kathirvel and Chinnadurai kidnap Shenbagam, Ponnazhagi and Parvathi, but Rajadurai finally saves them. During the fight, Kathirvel and Chinnadurai accidentally stab one other to death.

Another name for food web is '''[[Consumer-resource systems|consumer-resource system]]'''. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called [[trophic level]]s: 1) the [[autotroph]]s, and 2) the [[heterotroph]]s. To [[Maintenance of an organism|maintain]] their bodies, grow, develop, and to [[Reproduction|reproduce]], autotrophs produce [[organic matter]] from [[inorganic]] substances, including both [[mineral]]s and [[gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]]. These [[chemical reaction]]s require [[energy]], which mainly comes from the [[Sun]] and largely by [[photosynthesis]], although a very small amount comes from [[bioelectrogenesis]] in wetlands,<ref name=\"Nowak\">{{Cite journal| last = Nowak| first = M.

A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to [[mixotroph]]s (such as [[carnivorous plant]]s) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into [[herbivory]], [[carnivory]], [[scavenging]] and [[parasitism]]. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as [[sugar]]s, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] to many [[tonne]]s - from [[cyanobacteria]] to [[giant redwood]]s, and from [[virus]]es and [[bdellovibrio]] to [[blue whale]]s.\n\n[[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book \"Animal Ecology\"; Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text. Elton organized [[species]] into [[Functional group (ecology)|functional groups]], which was the basis for [[Raymond Lindeman]]'s classic and landmark paper in 1942 on trophic dynamics. Lindeman emphasized the important role of [[decomposer]] organisms in a [[trophic level|trophic system of classification]]. The notion of a food web has a historical foothold in the writings of [[Charles Darwin]] and his terminology, including an \"entangled bank\", \"web of life\", \"web of complex relations\", and in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms he talked about \"the continued movement of the particles of earth\". Even earlier, in 1768 [[John Bruckner]] described nature as \"one continued web of life\".\n\nFood webs are limited representations of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into [[trophic species]], which are functional groups of species that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in [[quantitative research|quantitative]] (or mathematical representation) [[Ecosystem model|models]] of trophic or [[consumer-resource systems]] dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns in the structure of real food web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the [[Network topology|topographic]] structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in [[meta analysis]] are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using [[network theory]] had identified patterns that are common to all. [[Power law|Scaling laws]], for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of [[species richness]].\n\n==Taxonomy of a food web ==\n[[File:FoodWebSimple.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|A simplified food web illustrating a three trophic food chain (''producers-herbivores-carnivores'') linked to decomposers.

Like maps of unfamiliar ground, food webs appear bewilderingly complex. They were often published to make just that point. Yet recent studies have shown that food webs from a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine communities share a remarkable list of patterns.<ref name=\"Pimm91\" />{{Rp|669}}\n| width = 25%\n| align = right}}\n\nLinks in food webs map the feeding connections (who eats whom) in an [[ecological community]]. ''Food cycle'' is an obsolete term that is [[synonymous]] with food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the [[autotrophs]] and the [[heterotrophs]]. Autotrophs [[primary production|produce]] more [[biomass energy]], either [[chemoautotroph|chemically]] without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in [[photosynthesis]], than they use during [[metabolism|metabolic]] [[Cellular respiration|respiration]]. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of [[secondary production]]. A food web depicts a collection of [[Oligophagy|polyphagous]] [[heterotrophs|heterotrophic]] consumers that [[ecological network|network]] and [[Recycling (ecological)|cycle]] the [[energy flow (ecology)|flow of energy]] and [[nutrients]] from a productive base of self-feeding [[autotrophs]].<ref name=\"Pimm91\" /><ref name=\"Odum05\" /><ref name=\"Benke10\" />\n\nThe base or basal species in a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or [[saprophyte|saprophytic]] [[detritivore]]s (i.e., the community of [[decomposer]]s in [[soil]], [[biofilms]], and [[periphyton]]). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer is a measure of food web [[Ecological network|connectance]]. [[Food chains]] are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace [[monophagous]] consumers from a base species up to the [[Apex predator|top consumer]], which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.<ref name=\"Allesina08\">{{cite journal | last1=Allesina | first1=S. | last2=Alonso | first2=D. | last3=Pascual | first3=M. | title=A general model for food web structure. | journal=Science | volume=320 | issue=5876 | pages=658\u2013661 | doi=10.1126/science.1156269 | pmid=18451301 | url=http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Secret/PlantGenome/General%20Model%20for%20Food%20WEb%20Structure.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928122643/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Secret/PlantGenome/General%20Model%20for%20Food%20WEb%20Structure.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-28 | bibcode=2008Sci...320..658A | year=2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"Azam83\">{{cite journal | last1=Azam | first1=F. | last2=Fenche | first2=T. | last3=Field | first3=J.

Omnivores, for example, are not restricted to any single level. Nonetheless, recent research has found that discrete trophic levels do exist, but \"above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.\"<ref name=\"Thompson07\" />\n\nA central question in the trophic dynamic literature is the nature of control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, decomposer). Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of ecological control mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or 'green-world' hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the nutritional quality or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control.<ref name=\"Hariston93\" /><ref name=\"Fretwell87\">{{cite journal | last1=Fretwell | first1=S.

Links in a food-web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the trophic levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food-web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food-web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.<ref name=\"Polis00\">{{cite journal|author = Polis, G.A.|title = When is a trophic cascade a trophic cascade?|year = 2000| journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume = 15|issue=11|pages=473\u20135|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/leopold/class-reading/Polis%202000.pdf|doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01971-6|pmid = 11050351|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Energy flow and biomass===\n[[File:EnergyFlowFrog.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Energy flow diagram of a frog.

However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to [[mixotroph]]s (such as [[carnivorous plant]]s) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into [[herbivory]], [[carnivory]], [[scavenging]] and [[parasitism]]. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as [[sugar]]s, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] to many [[tonne]]s - from [[cyanobacteria]] to [[giant redwood]]s, and from [[virus]]es and [[bdellovibrio]] to [[blue whale]]s.\n\n[[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] pioneered the concept of food cycles, food chains, and food size in his classical 1927 book \"Animal Ecology\"; Elton's 'food cycle' was replaced by 'food web' in a subsequent ecological text.

Even earlier, in 1768 [[John Bruckner]] described nature as \"one continued web of life\".\n\nFood webs are limited representations of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into [[trophic species]], which are functional groups of species that have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in [[quantitative research|quantitative]] (or mathematical representation) [[Ecosystem model|models]] of trophic or [[consumer-resource systems]] dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns in the structure of real food web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the [[Network topology|topographic]] structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in [[meta analysis]] are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using [[network theory]] had identified patterns that are common to all. [[Power law|Scaling laws]], for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of [[species richness]].\n\n==Taxonomy of a food web ==\n[[File:FoodWebSimple.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|A simplified food web illustrating a three trophic food chain (''producers-herbivores-carnivores'') linked to decomposers.

''Food cycle'' is an obsolete term that is [[synonymous]] with food web. Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the [[autotrophs]] and the [[heterotrophs]]. Autotrophs [[primary production|produce]] more [[biomass energy]], either [[chemoautotroph|chemically]] without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in [[photosynthesis]], than they use during [[metabolism|metabolic]] [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].

Omnivores, for example, are not restricted to any single level. Nonetheless, recent research has found that discrete trophic levels do exist, but \"above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.\"<ref name=\"Thompson07\" />\n\nA central question in the trophic dynamic literature is the nature of control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, decomposer). Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of ecological control mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or 'green-world' hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the nutritional quality or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control.<ref name=\"Hariston93\" /><ref name=\"Fretwell87\">{{cite journal | last1=Fretwell | first1=S.

Links in a food-web illustrate direct trophic relations among species, but there are also indirect effects that can alter the abundance, distribution, or biomass in the trophic levels. For example, predators eating herbivores indirectly influence the control and regulation of primary production in plants. Although the predators do not eat the plants directly, they regulate the population of herbivores that are directly linked to plant trophism. The net effect of direct and indirect relations is called trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are separated into species-level cascades, where only a subset of the food-web dynamic is impacted by a change in population numbers, and community-level cascades, where a change in population numbers has a dramatic effect on the entire food-web, such as the distribution of plant biomass.<ref name=\"Polis00\">{{cite journal|author = Polis, G.A.|title = When is a trophic cascade a trophic cascade?|year = 2000| journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume = 15|issue=11|pages=473\u20135|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/leopold/class-reading/Polis%202000.pdf|doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(00)01971-6|pmid = 11050351|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Energy flow and biomass===\n[[File:EnergyFlowFrog.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Energy flow diagram of a frog.

In some instances biomass pyramids can be inverted. This pattern is often identified in aquatic and coral reef ecosystems. The pattern of biomass inversion is attributed to different sizes of producers. Aquatic communities are often dominated by producers that are smaller than the consumers that have high growth rates. Aquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] as exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted. Energy pyramids, however, will always have an upright pyramid shape if all sources of food energy are included and this is dictated by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"Odum05\" /><ref name=\"Wang09\">{{cite journal | last1=Wang | first1=H. | last2=Morrison | first2=W. | last3=Singh | first3=A. | last4=Weiss | first4=H. | title=Modeling inverted biomass pyramids and refuges in ecosystems | journal=Ecological Modelling | volume=220 | issue=11 | pages=1376\u20131382 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.03.005 | year=2009 | url=http://people.math.gatech.edu/~weiss/pub/General_Mechanisms_Final.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007214333/http://people.math.gatech.edu/~weiss/pub/General_Mechanisms_Final.pdf | archivedate=2011-10-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Material flux and recycling==\n{{main|Nutrient cycle}}\n\nMany of the Earth's [[Chemical element|element]]s and [[minerals]] (or mineral nutrients) are contained within the tissues and diets of organisms.

These characterizations stem from the ecosystem concept, which assumes that the phenomena under investigation (interactions and feedback loops) are sufficient to explain patterns within boundaries, such as the edge of a forest, an island, a shoreline, or some other pronounced physical characteristic.<ref name=\"Bormann67\" /><ref name=\"Polis97\" /><ref name=\"O'Neil01\" />\n\n[[File:Soil food webUSDA.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|An illustration of a soil food web.]]\n=== Detrital web ===\n\nIn a detrital web, plant and animal matter is broken down by decomposers, e.g., bacteria and fungi, and moves to detritivores and then carnivores.<ref>{{cite book | last1= G\u00f6nen\u00e7| first1= I.

{"title_page": "List of power metal bands", "text_new": "{{Dynamic list}} \nThis is a '''list of power metal bands''' including notable bands that have at some point in their careers played power metal or heavily contributed to the genre's development. [[Power metal]] is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music combining characteristics of [[traditional heavy metal|traditional metal]] with [[speed metal]], often within [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. Power metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. [[Power metal#American style|US Power Metal]] was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as [[Omen (band)|Omen]] characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by [[speed metal]] and [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]], and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. [[Power metal#European power metal|European Power Metal]] was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as [[Helloween]], and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs.\n\n<!-- Please add bands that have articles to this list.

[[Power metal]] is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] music combining characteristics of [[traditional heavy metal|traditional metal]] with [[speed metal]], often within [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. Power metal has two distinct early styles, which developed in parallel. [[Power metal#American style|US Power Metal]] was developed in the mid/late 80s, pioneered by bands such as [[Omen (band)|Omen]] characterized by harsh thrashy sound and a focus on speed and soaring operatic vocals. It was directly influenced by [[speed metal]] and [[new wave of British heavy metal|NWOBHM]], and had a drop in popularity in the 90s. [[Power metal#European power metal|European Power Metal]] was developed in the late 80s by key bands such as [[Helloween]], and was more melodic, employing keyboards, synths and anthem-like songs.\n\n<!-- Please add bands that have articles to this list.

It also operated bus services extending into [[Telford and Wrekin|Telford & Wrekin]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Gwynedd]], and [[Merseyside]].\n\nGHA Coaches ceased trading after entering administration on 13 July 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrexham.com/news/gha-coaches-enter-administration-with-immediate-effect-116090.html|title=400 \"Jobs At Risk As GHA Coaches Enter Administration & 'Cease Trading'\"|publisher=}}</ref> Former GHA services are now operated by a variety of operators including [[Arriva North West]], [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]]<!-- Link to the group and not operator. -->, [[High Peak Buses|High Peak]] and [[D&G Bus]].\n\n==History==\nGHA Coaches was founded by Eifion Lloyd Davies in 1990 and was originally based in [[Corwen]] before moving to [[Ruabon]] in the mid-1990s. It later expanded with the purchase of a number of other local companies, including:<ref>[http://www.ghacoaches.co.uk/about_us.asp About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012004743/http://www.ghacoaches.co.uk/about_us.asp |date=12 October 2013 }} GHA Coaches</ref>\n\n*Hanmers Coaches, [[Southsea, Wrexham|Southsea]]\n*Chaloner's Buses, Moss\n*Bryn Melyn, [[Llangollen]]\n*Vale (of Llangollen) Travel, [[Cefn Mawr]]\n*JO Travel, [[Ponciau]]\n*Pat's Coaches, [[New Broughton, Wrexham|New Broughton]] (bus operations only)\n*RS Travel, [[Middlewich]]\n*Dobsons, [[Lostock Gralam]]\n*Shropshire Bus & Coach, [[Shrewsbury]]\n\nDespite being founded in north east Wales, only about half of the bus services run by the company at the time of closure were in this area. Services extended as far north as Manchester and Rhyl, to Hanley and Telford in the east, to Shrewsbury in the south and to Barmouth in the west.\n\n==Coach operations==\nMany coaches were inherited with the purchase of Hanmers Coaches, though as with the bus operations, the coach fleet expanded rapidly. Most coaches carried a livery of silver with red and burgundy stripes and the GHA Coaches name; some were in a similar livery with a white base and the Vale Travel name; some carried a plain yellow livery for school work.\n\nThe most common use for the coach fleet was school transport, and GHA had a number of high-capacity coaches dedicated to this work. Coaches were also used for private hire and occasional day trip and holiday work.\n\n==Depots==\nGHA's headquarters were at [[Ruabon]]. Other depots were at [[Tarvin]], [[Ruthin]], [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Winsford]]. Vehicles also operated an outstation at [[Betws Gwerfil Goch]].\n\n==Fleet==\nAs at June 2015 the fleet consisted of 325 buses and coaches.<ref>[http://www.ronsbusesandcoaches.com/gha/gha-group-fleetlist] GHA Coaches</ref>\n\n==GHA Gold==\nIn October 2014 GHA launched a 'GHA Gold' brand on the 88 Knutsford to Wilmslow to Altrincham route.  They acquired four new [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200]] buses which have [[WiFi]], leather seats, wood effect flooring, a passenger information system and one table on each bus.  These vehicles carried branding for the route.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=James|title=Bus firm launches new 'gold service' at Tatton Park|url=http://www.knutsfordguardian.co.uk/news/11561361.Bus_firm_launches_new__gold_service__at_Tatton_Park/?ref=mr|work=Knutsford Guardian|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Chapman |first1=Jess Amy |title=GHA Coaches launches first premium bus service |url=http://www.route-one.net/industry/operations/gha-coaches-launches-first-premium-bus-service/ |website=Route One |accessdate=23 March 2015 |date=29 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114515/http://www.route-one.net/industry/operations/gha-coaches-launches-first-premium-bus-service/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> They were funded by [[Waters Corporation]] as part of a public transport commitment in order for them to get planning permission for building a new large employment site just outside Morley Green.  Two of the buses are now owned and operated by Redline buses of Aylesbury who kept the Gold service branding, using them on their service 21 in and around Milton Keynes.\n\nGHA went on to launch a second Gold route between Congleton and Crewe the following year.\n\n==Bus Wars== \nFollowing GHA taking over a couple of bus routes in the [[Northwich]] area they launched an hourly 45 Northwich to Warrington service running 5 minutes ahead of an existing hourly service operated by [[Network Warrington]], followed by a 16 service between Warrington and Dallam again running just ahead of an existing Network Warrington service.  Two new Optare Metrocity buses were acquired to operate the Warrington services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ronnewbe/gha/gha-stor|title=GHA Story so far - Ronsbusesandcoaches.com|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>  The bus war led to constant timetable changes by both operators and eventually Network Warrington deciding to route all their Northwich to Warrington services via Barnton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/14427281.Wincham_is_to_retain_its_45_bus_after_agreement_between_Cheshire_West_and_Network_Warrington/|title=Wincham is to retain its 45 bus after agreement between Cheshire West and Network Warrington|website=Northwich Guardian|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>  At times GHA drivers were known to block bus stands to prevent Network Warrington drivers picking up passengers, which on occasions led to angry exchanges between drivers and on one occasion a GHA driver committed a physical assault on a Network Warrington driver for which he received a suspended jail term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/12924573.Bus_driver_avoids_jail_after_assault_on_Network_Warrington_driver/|title=Bus driver avoids jail after assault on Network Warrington driver|website=Warrington Guardian|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAnother bus war was launched against Nantwich based Routemaster Buses who had started a C84 service between Chester and Crewe after Arriva had reduced their 84 service between Chester and Crewe to hourly from half-hourly.  The operations manager of GHA accused Routemaster of invading 'their territory' in a Facebook post and they launched a rival 84 service running 2 minutes ahead of the Routemaster Buses service.\n\n==Administration==\nAfter GHA failed to pay almost \u00a31m in taxes, HMRC took out a court order against GHA placing the company in to administration.

Services extended as far north as Manchester and Rhyl, to Hanley and Telford in the east, to Shrewsbury in the south and to Barmouth in the west.\n\n==Coach operations==\nMany coaches were inherited with the purchase of Hanmers Coaches, though as with the bus operations, the coach fleet expanded rapidly. Most coaches carried a livery of silver with red and burgundy stripes and the GHA Coaches name; some were in a similar livery with a white base and the Vale Travel name; some carried a plain yellow livery for school work.\n\nThe most common use for the coach fleet was school transport, and GHA had a number of high-capacity coaches dedicated to this work. Coaches were also used for private hire and occasional day trip and holiday work.\n\n==Depots==\nGHA's headquarters were at [[Ruabon]]. Other depots were at [[Tarvin]], [[Ruthin]], [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Winsford]]. Vehicles also operated an outstation at [[Betws Gwerfil Goch]].\n\n==Fleet==\nAs at June 2015 the fleet consisted of 325 buses and coaches.<ref>[http://www.ronsbusesandcoaches.com/gha/gha-group-fleetlist] GHA Coaches</ref>\n\n==GHA Gold==\nIn October 2014 GHA launched a 'GHA Gold' brand on the 88 Knutsford to Wilmslow to Altrincham route.  They acquired four new [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200]] buses which have [[WiFi]], leather seats, wood effect flooring, a passenger information system and one table on each bus.

These dead cells are interlaid with [[lipids]] secreted by the [[stratum granulosum]] just underneath, which help to make this layer of the skin a waterproof barrier. The stratum corneum's function is to reduce water loss, repel water, protect deeper layers of the skin from injury, and to repel [[Microbe|microbial]] invasion of the skin. In infants, this layer of the skin is much thinner and more easily disrupted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiou|first=Y.B.|last2=Blume-Peytavi|first2=U.|date=2004|title=Stratum Corneum Maturation|journal=Skin Pharmacology and Physiology|language=english|volume=17|issue=2|pages=57\u201366|doi=10.1159/000076015|pmid=14976382|issn=1660-5527}}</ref>\n\n=== Urine ===\n[[Image:Cloth diaper gogreenpocketdiapercom.jpg|thumb|Cloth diaper]]\nAlthough wetness alone has the effect of macerating the skin, softening the stratum corneum, and greatly increasing susceptibility to friction injury, urine has an additional impact on skin integrity because of its effect on skin [[pH]]. While studies show that [[ammonia]] alone is only a mild skin irritant, when [[urea]] breaks down in the presence of fecal [[urease]] it increases pH because ammonia is released, which in turn promotes the activity of [[fecal]] [[enzymes]] such as [[protease]] and [[lipase]].<ref name=\":0\" /> These fecal enzymes increase the skin's hydration and permeability to [[bile salts]] which also act as skin irritants.\n\nThere is no detectable difference in rates of diaper rash in conventional disposable diaper wearers and reusable [[cloth diaper]] wearers. \"Babies wearing superabsorbent disposable diapers with a central gelling material have fewer episodes of diaper dermatitis compared with their counterparts wearing cloth diapers. However, keep in mind that superabsorbent diapers contain dyes that were suspected to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/801222-overview|title=Diaper Rash|last=Dib|first=Rania|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> Whether wearing cloth or disposable diapers they should be changed frequently to prevent diaper rash, even if they don't feel wet. To reduce the incidence of diaper rash, disposable diapers have been engineered to pull moisture away from the baby's skin using synthetic non-biodegradable gel.  Today, [[cloth diapers]] use newly available superabsorbent microfiber cloth placed in a pocket with a layer of light permeable material that contacts the skin.  This design serves to pull moisture away from the skin in to the microfiber cloth.  This technology is used in most major pocket [[cloth diapers]] brands today.\n\n=== Diet ===\nThe interaction between fecal enzyme activity and IDD explains the observation that infant diet and diaper rash are linked because fecal enzymes are in turn affected by diet. Breast-fed babies, for example, have a lower incidence of diaper rash, possibly because their stools have higher pH and lower enzymatic activity.<ref>Hockenberry, M.J.

These dead cells are interlaid with [[lipids]] secreted by the [[stratum granulosum]] just underneath, which help to make this layer of the skin a waterproof barrier. The stratum corneum's function is to reduce water loss, repel water, protect deeper layers of the skin from injury, and to repel [[Microbe|microbial]] invasion of the skin. In infants, this layer of the skin is much thinner and more easily disrupted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiou|first=Y.B.|last2=Blume-Peytavi|first2=U.|date=2004|title=Stratum Corneum Maturation|journal=Skin Pharmacology and Physiology|language=english|volume=17|issue=2|pages=57\u201366|doi=10.1159/000076015|pmid=14976382|issn=1660-5527}}</ref>\n\n=== Urine ===\n[[Image:Cloth diaper gogreenpocketdiapercom.jpg|thumb|Cloth diaper]]\nAlthough wetness alone has the effect of macerating the skin, softening the stratum corneum, and greatly increasing susceptibility to friction injury, urine has an additional impact on skin integrity because of its effect on skin [[pH]]. While studies show that [[ammonia]] alone is only a mild skin irritant, when [[urea]] breaks down in the presence of fecal [[urease]] it increases pH because ammonia is released, which in turn promotes the activity of [[fecal]] [[enzymes]] such as [[protease]] and [[lipase]].<ref name=\":0\" /> These fecal enzymes increase the skin's hydration and permeability to [[bile salts]] which also act as skin irritants.\n\nThere is no detectable difference in rates of diaper rash in conventional disposable diaper wearers and reusable [[cloth diaper]] wearers. \"Babies wearing superabsorbent disposable diapers with a central gelling material have fewer episodes of diaper dermatitis compared with their counterparts wearing cloth diapers. However, keep in mind that superabsorbent diapers contain dyes that were suspected to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/801222-overview|title=Diaper Rash|last=Dib|first=Rania|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> Whether wearing cloth or disposable diapers they should be changed frequently to prevent diaper rash, even if they don't feel wet. To reduce the incidence of diaper rash, disposable diapers have been engineered to pull moisture away from the baby's skin using synthetic non-biodegradable gel.  Today, [[cloth diapers]] use newly available superabsorbent microfiber cloth placed in a pocket with a layer of light permeable material that contacts the skin.  This design serves to pull moisture away from the skin in to the microfiber cloth.  This technology is used in most major pocket [[cloth diapers]] brands today.\n\n=== Diet ===\nThe interaction between fecal enzyme activity and IDD explains the observation that infant diet and diaper rash are linked because fecal enzymes are in turn affected by diet. Breast-fed babies, for example, have a lower incidence of diaper rash, possibly because their stools have higher pH and lower enzymatic activity.<ref>Hockenberry, M.J.

A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.<ref name=\":3\">Scheinfeld, N., Diaper dermatitis : a review and brief survey of eruptions of the diaper area. ''American Journal of Clinical Dermatology''. 2005;6:273-81. {{PMID|16252927}}</ref>\n\nOverall, there is sparse evidence of sufficient quality to be certain of the effectiveness of the various treatments. Washcloths with cleansing, moisturising and protective properties may be better than soap and water, and skin cleansers may also be better than soap and water, but the certainty of evidence with regard other treatments is very low.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beeckman |first1=D |last2=Van Damme |first2=N |last3=Schoonhoven |first3=L |last4=Van Lancker |first4=A |last5=Kottner |first5=J |last6=Beele |first6=H |last7=Gray |first7=M |last8=Woodward |first8=S |last9=Fader |first9=M |last10=Van den Bussche |first10=K |last11=Van Hecke |first11=A |last12=De Meyer |first12=D |last13=Verhaeghe |first13=S |title=Interventions for preventing and treating incontinence-associated dermatitis in adults. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=10 November 2016 |volume=11 |pages=CD011627 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011627.pub2 |pmid=27841440|pmc=6464993 }}</ref>\n\n=== Diaper changing ===\nThe most effective treatment, although not the most practical one, is to discontinue use of diapers, allowing the affected skin to air out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medinfo.co.uk/conditions/nappyrash.html|title=Nappy Rash|publisher=Medinfo|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> Another option is simply to increase the frequency of diaper changing.<ref name=\":2\" /> Thorough drying of the skin before diapering is a good preventive measure because it is the excess moisture, either from urine and feces or from sweating, that sets the conditions for a diaper rash to occur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thebabyrash.com/how-to-treat-baby-rash#Nappy-Rash|title=How to Treat Baby Rash?

Such sealants sometimes accomplish the opposite if the skin is not thoroughly dry, in which case they serve to seal the moisture ''inside'' the skin rather than outside.\n\n[[Zinc oxide]]-based ointments such as [[Pinxav]] can be quite effective, especially in prevention, because they have both a drying and an astringent effect on the skin, being mildly antiseptic without causing irritation.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nA 2005 meta-analysis found no evidence to support the use of topical vitamin A to treat napkin dermatitis (diaper rash).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Mark W|last2=Dore|first2=Amanda J|last3=Perissinotto|first3=Kaylene L|date=2005-10-19|title=Topical Vitamin A, or its derivatives, for treating and preventing napkin dermatitis in infants|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD004300/SKIN_vitamin-a-creams-and-lotions-for-nappy-diaper-rash|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=4|pages=CD004300|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004300.pub2|pmid=16235358|pmc=6718230|issn=1465-1858}}</ref>\n\n=== Dangers of using powders ===\nVarious moisture-absorbing powders, such as [[talcum]] or [[starch]], reduce moisture but may introduce other complications. Airborne powders of any sort can irritate lung tissue, and powders made from starchy plants (corn, arrowroot) provide food for fungi and are not recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aad.org/media-resources/stats-and-facts/prevention-and-care/mom-and-baby-skin-care|title=Mom and baby skin care|publisher=American Academy of Dermatology|accessdate=31 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817223715/http://www.aad.org/media-resources/stats-and-facts/prevention-and-care/mom-and-baby-skin-care|archive-date=17 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Antifungals ===\nIn persistent or especially bad rashes, an [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] cream often has to be used.  In cases that the rash is more of an irritation, a ''mild'' topical [[corticosteroid]] preparation, e.g. [[hydrocortisone]] cream, is used.  As it is often difficult to tell a fungal infection apart from a mere skin irritation, many physicians prefer an corticosteroid-and-antifungal combination cream such as [[hydrocortisone/miconazole]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = 23119  \n|  ICD10           = {{ICD10|L|22||l|20}}  \n|  ICD9            = {{ICD9|691.0}}  \n|  ICDO            =  \n|  OMIM            =  \n|  MedlinePlus     = 000964 \n|  eMedicineSubj   = ped  \n|  eMedicineTopic  = 2755  \n|  MeshID          = D003963 \n}}\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n{{Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue}}\n\n[[Category:Diapers]]\n[[Category:Babycare]]\n[[Category:Eczema]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTreatments:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritant_diaper_dermatitis"}
