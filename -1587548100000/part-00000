By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TNT\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' and ''[[Random!

Three more series based on shorts debuted from 1997 to 1999: ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' (the latter two as segments of the same show; ''I Am Weasel'' was later spun off into a separate show), ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu & Og]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\"/><ref name=\"Mike, Lu And Og\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/95956-Mike_Lu_And_Og.html|title=Mike, Lu And Og (1996)&nbsp;\u2013 What A Cartoon!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977).

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films.

The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TNT\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977).

On October 3, the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays block was rebooted in a live-action format as \"Fridays\", hosted by Tommy Snider and Nzinga Blake (2003\u20132004), the latter of which was later replaced by Tara Sands (2005\u20132007).

These bumpers lasted from 2004 to 2007. By now, nearly all of Cartoon Network's classic programming had been relocated to its sister network [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] to make way for new programming.\n\n2005 saw the debuts of five more original series: ''[[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', ''[[Robotboy]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', and ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]''. On August 22, Cartoon Network launched a block aimed at the preschool demographic known as ''[[Tickle-U]]''; shows on the block included ''[[Gordon the Garden Gnome]]'', ''[[Yoko! Jakamoko! Toto!]]'', ''[[Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Little Robots]]'', ''[[Firehouse Tales]]'', and ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing (TV series)|Gerald McBoing-Boing]]''. The block was largely unsuccessful and was discontinued in 2007.

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''. Three made-for-TV movies debuted this year: ''[[Operation Z.E.R.O.|Codename: Kids Next Door&nbsp;\u2013 Operation Z.E.R.O.]]'', ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: Good Wilt Hunting]]'', and ''[[Re-Animated]]'', the latter of which was the network's first live-action TV movie and a collaboration between live-action and animation.\n\nSamples resigned from his post on February 9, 2007, following a [[2007 Boston Mooninite panic|bomb scare in Boston]] caused by packages left around the city that were part of an outdoor marketing campaign promoting the Adult Swim series ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare|url=https://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|date=February 1, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803005034/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|archive-date=August 3, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Jim Samples\">{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|title=Cartoon Network Boss Quits Over Bomb Scare|date=February 9, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322003040/http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|archive-date=March 22, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> On May 2, Stuart Snyder was named Samples' successor.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php| title= Stuart Snyder: The Perfect Combination| first= Allison| last= Romano| date= October 21, 2007| publisher= Broadcasting & Cable| accessdate= August 13, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100218194456/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php| archive-date= February 18, 2010| url-status= dead}}</ref> On September 1, the network's look was revamped, with bumpers and station IDs themed to [[The Hives]] song \"[[The Hives#The Hives on Cartoon Network|Fall is Just Something That Grown-Ups Invented]].\" 2007 saw the debut of ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'', a spin-off of the movie ''Re-Animated'', and the first live-action Cartoon Network series. 2007 also saw the debut of the series ''[[Chowder (TV series)|Chowder]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

Points can be scored in the game by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though, unlike sports such as [[Archery]], these are randomly allocated throughout the board and do not follow a common principle of points increasing towards the centre of the board. Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term \"darts\" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules. \n\nAs well as being a professional competitive sport, darts is a traditional [[pub game]].

The Manchester board is smaller than the standard, with a playing area of only {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} across, with double and bull areas measuring just {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}}.  The London Fives board is another variation, with only 12 equal segments, with the doubles and trebles being a quarter of an inch (6.35 mm) wide.\n\nMathematically, removing the rotational symmetry by placing the \"20\" at the top, there are [[Factorial|19!]], or 121,645,100,408,832,000 possible dartboards.

Their slenderness makes them better for grouping, but because they are long, the centre of gravity is further back.\n* Ton-shaped barrels are thin at either end and bulge in the middle. This makes them fatter than a cylindrical barrel of equivalent weight but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically easier to throw.\n* Torpedo-shaped barrels are widest at the pointed end and taper towards the rear. This shape keeps the bulk of the weight as far forward as possible but, like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the cylinder.\n\nThe shafts are manufactured in various lengths, and some are designed to be cut to length. Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible.<ref name=\"china3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadart.com/dart_accessories_shaft.htm |title=Shafts |publisher=Chinadart |accessdate=12 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111155944/http://www.chinadart.com/dart_accessories_shaft.htm |archive-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Longer shafts provide greater stability and allow a reduction in flight size which in turn can lead to closer grouping; but, they also shift the weight towards the rear causing the dart to tilt backwards during flight, requiring a harder, faster throw.\n\nThe flight stabilizes the dart by producing [[Drag (physics)|drag]], thus preventing the rear of the dart from overtaking the point.<ref name=\"Dartsworld\" /> Modern flights are generally made from plastic, nylon, or foil and are available in a range of shapes and sizes. The three most common shapes in order of size are the standard, the kite, and the smaller pear shape. The less surface area, the less stability but larger flights hamper close grouping. Some manufacturers have sought to solve this by making a flight long and thin but this, in turn, creates other problems such as changing the dart's centre of gravity. Generally speaking, a heavier dart will require a larger flight.<ref name=\"Dartsworld\" />\n\nThe choice of barrel, shaft, and flight will depend a great deal on the individual player's throwing style.

If the face projects outward from the wall, due to the thickness of the board and/or a cabinet in which it is mounted, the oche must be moved back appropriately to maintain the required distance.\n\nThe regulations came about due to the United Kingdom and the rest of the world playing at different lengths, with {{cvt|2.37|m|ftin|frac=4}} being the compromise length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartswdf.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2018-02-28_WDF_Playing_Tournament_Rules_rev_20.pdf|title=World Darts Federation Playing and Tournament Rules Twentieth Revised Edition|date=28 February 2018|website=www.dartswdf.com|access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Scoring==\n[[File:Dartboard_heatmap.svg|thumb|Scores for each region of a dartboard (not to scale) shaded by value]]\nThe standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. The dartboard featured on ''[[The Indoor League]]'' television show of the 1970s did not feature a triple section, and according to host [[Fred Trueman]] during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board.\n\nVarious games can be played (and still are played informally) using the standard dartboard. However, in the official game, any dart landing inside the outer wire scores as follows:\n*Hitting one of the large portions sections, traditionally alternately coloured black and white, scores the points value of that section.\n* Hitting the thin inner portions of these sections, roughly halfway between the outer wire and the central circle coloured red or green, scores triple the points value of that section.\n* Hitting the thin outer portions of these sections, again coloured red or green, scores double the points value of that section. The double-20 is often referred to as double-top, reflecting the 20's position on the dartboard.\n*The central circle is divided into a green outer ring worth 25 points (known as \"outer\", \"outer bull\", or \"single bull\") and a red or black inner circle (usually known as \"bull\", \"inner bull\" or \"double bull\"), worth 50 points. The term \"bullseye\" can mean either the whole central part of the board or just the inner red/black section. The term \"bull's ring\" usually means just the green outer ring. The inner bull counts as a double when doubling in or out.\n*Hitting outside the outer wire scores nothing.\n* A dart only scores if its point is embedded in or is touching the playing surface. This rule applies to any dart that lands in such a way as to be partially or totally supported by others that have already hit the board.\n* When a standard board is used, any dart whose point does not remain in contact with the playing surface until being collected by the player does not score. This includes darts that bounce off the board for any reason, that fall off on their own, or that are dislodged by the impact of later throws. However, when an electronic board is used, fallen/dislodged darts do score as long as their impacts have registered on the board first.\n\nThe highest score possible with three darts is 180, commonly known as a \"ton 80\" (100 points is called a ton), obtained when all three darts land in the triple 20. In the [[television|televised]] game, the [[referee]] frequently announces a score of 180 in exuberant style. A \"quad\" ring appeared briefly between the triple ring and the bull in the 1990s, leading to a potential ''240'' maximum (three quad-20s), a ''210'' maximum checkout (Q20-Q20-Bull) and ''seven'' dart finishes from a 501 start (five quad-20s, triple-17, bullseye), but was swiftly dropped from professional tournament play after only two years.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qzifRI2UrI|title=Jocky Wilson Only 240 Ever Seen vs John Lowe Skol World Matchplay|date=16 November 2013|work=YouTube|access-date=22 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218120128/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qzifRI2UrI|archive-date=18 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> One make of this board was the Harrows Quadro 240.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crowsdarts.com/reviews/quadro.html|title=QUADRO Dartboard|author=Tim Cronian|work=crowsdarts.com|access-date=2014-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223233244/http://www.crowsdarts.com/reviews/quadro.html|archive-date=2015-02-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Skill level and aiming===\n[[Image:Optimal Dart Throw Location Skill Level.jpg|thumb|Path of the optimal location to throw a dart where \u03c3 = 0 is a perfect player and \u03c3 = 100 is a player who throws randomly.]]\nAssuming standard scoring, the optimal area to aim for on the dartboard to maximize the player's score varies significantly based on the player's skill. The skilled player should aim for the centre of the T20, and as the player's skill decreases, their aim moves slightly up and to the left of the T20. At \u03c3 = 16.4&nbsp;mm the best place to aim jumps to the T19. As the player's skill decreases further, the best place to aim curls into the centre of the board, stopping a bit lower than and to the left of the bullseye at \u03c3 = 100.<ref>Ryan J. Tibshirani, Andrew Price, and Jonathan Taylor (January 2011) [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ryantibs/papers/darts.pdf \"A statistician plays darts\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050313/http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ryantibs/papers/darts.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}, ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'', series A, vol. 174, no. 1, pages 213\u2013226</ref>\n\nWhere [[\u03c3]]  may refer to the [[standard deviation]] for a specific population: [[List of darts players]].\n\n==Games==\nMany games can be played on a dartboard, but the term \"darts\" generally refers to a game in which one player at a time throws three darts per turn. The throwing player must stand so that no portion of his/her feet extends past the leading edge of the oche, but may stand on any other portion and/or lean forward over it if desired.\n\nA game of darts is generally contested between two players, who take turns. The most common objective is to reduce a fixed score, commonly 301 or 501, to zero (\"checking out\"). The final dart must land in either the bullseye or a double segment to win. Not all three darts need to be thrown on the final turn, the game can be finished on any of the three darts. When two teams play, the starting score is sometimes increased to 701 or even 1001; the rules remain the same.\n\nA throw that reduces a player's score below zero, to exactly one, or to zero but not ending with a double is known as \"going bust\", with the player's score being reset to the value before starting the turn, and the remainder of the turn being forfeited.\n\nIn some variants (called a \"northern bust\" in London) only the dart that causes the bust is not counted. That is felt by some to be a purer version of the game, as under the normal rules, as explained above, a player left with a difficult finish, e.g. 5 and one dart remaining will often deliberately \"bust\" it to get back to the easier finish that they had at the start of their go. For example, a player with 20 at the start of their go could miss the double 10 and get a single, miss the double 5 and get a single, leaving them 5 and only one dart remaining. Their best option is to deliberately bust it to get back onto double 10. Under the \"northern bust\" they would remain on 5.\n\nA darts match is played over a fixed number of games, known as legs. A match may be divided into sets, with each set being contested as over a fixed number of legs.\n\nAlthough playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as \"doubling in\", with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC's [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] uses this format.\n\nThe minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common [[nine dart finish]] consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. Three 167s (T20-T19-Bull) is considered a pure or perfect nine-dart finish by some players.\n\n===Other games and variants===\nThere are several regional variations on the standard rules and scoring systems.\n\n====American darts====\n{{Main article|American Darts}}\nAmerican Darts is a regional USA variant of the game (most U.S. dart players play the traditional games described above). This style of dartboard is most often found in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New York state.\n\n====Cricket====\n{{Main article|Cricket (darts)}}\n\nCricket is a widely played darts game involving a race to control and score on numbers between 20 and 15 and the bullseye, by hitting each of these targets for three marks to ''open'' or ''own'' it for scoring.  A hit on the target counts as one mark, while hits in the doubles ring of the target count as two marks in one throw, and on the triples ring as three. Once opened in this manner, until the opponent ''closes'' that number with three marks on it of their own, each additional hit by the owner/opener scores points equal to the number of the target (which may also be doubled and tripled, e.g. a triple-20 is worth 60 points).  The outer bullseye counts as 25 points and the inner as 50.\n\n====Dartball====\n{{Main article|Dartball}}\nDartball is a darts game based on the sport of [[baseball]]. It is played on a diamond-shaped board and has similar scoring to baseball.\n\n====Dart golf====\n{{Main article|Dart golf}}\nDart golf is a darts game based on the sport of [[golf]] and is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF).<ref>\"History of Dolf\" http://www.dolfdarts.com/history-of-dolf {{Webarchive|url=https:ww.dolfdarts.com/history-of-dolf |date=2012-03-15 }}</ref> It is played on both special golf dartboards and traditional dartboards. Scoring is similar to golf.\n\n====Fives====\n[[Image:FivesDartboard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An '[[East End of London|East-End]]' or 'Fives' dartboard]]\nThis is a regional variant still played in some parts of the East End of London. The board has fewer, larger segments, all numbered either 5, 10, 15 or 20.

Initially, each player throws a dart at the board with their non-dominant hand to obtain their 'number'. No two players can have the same number. Once everyone has a number, each player takes it in turn to get their number five times with their three darts (doubles count twice, and triples three times). Once a person has reached 5, they become a 'killer'. This means they can aim for other peoples numbers, taking a point off for each time they hit (doubles x2, triples x3). If a person gets to zero they are out. A killer can aim for anyone's numbers, even another killer's. Players cannot get more than 5 points. The winner is 'the last man standing'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/world_darts_2004/3334207.stm |title=Board of brilliant versatility |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=2010-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714045548/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/world_darts_2004/3334207.stm |archive-date=14 July 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAnother version of \"Killer\" is a \"knock-out\" game for three or more players (the more the better). To start, everyone has a pre-determined number of lives, (usually 5) and a randomly chosen player throws a single dart at the board to set a target (i.e. single 18) and does not play until that target is hit. The next player up has 3 darts to try and hit the target (single 18), if they fail, they lose a life and the following player tries. Once a player succeeds at hitting the target, they then become the target setter and throw a dart to set a new target. The initial target setter swaps places with the new target setter. The games carries on until every players' lives have been used, the last man standing is the target setter whose target was not hit.  For less experienced players you can count doubles and trebles as part of the same number, i.e. a target of treble 20 can still be counted as a success if the double or single 20 is hit and vice versa.\n\n====Lawn darts====\n{{main article|Lawn darts}}\nLawn darts (also called Jarts or yard darts) is a lawn game based on darts. The gameplay and objective are similar to both [[horseshoes]] and darts.

A Fairer Start for Shanghai: To prevent players from becoming too practised at shooting for the 1, the number sequence can begin at the number of the dart that lost the throw for the bullseye to determine the starting thrower. For example; Thrower A shoots for the bullseye and hits the 17. Thrower B shoots for the bullseye and hits it. Thrower B then begins the game, starting on the number 17, then 18, 19, 20, 1, 2, 3, etc. through 16 (if no player hits Shanghai).\n\n==Darts organisations==\n===Professional organisations===\n{{Main article|Split in darts}}\nOf the two [[professional]] steel-tip organisations, the [[British Darts Organisation]] (BDO), founded in 1973, is the older. Its tournaments were often shown on the [[BBC]] in the UK. The BDO is a member of the [[World Darts Federation]] (WDF) (founded 1976), along with organizations in some 60 other countries worldwide. The BDO originally organised a number of the more prestigious British tournaments with a few notable exceptions such as the News of the World Championship and the national events run under the auspices of the National Darts Association of Great Britain. However, many sponsors were lost and British TV coverage became much reduced by the early nineties. As of 24 September 2016, the BBC no longer broadcasts the BDO World Championship.\n\nIn 1992, a group of darts players broke off from the BDO and, in pursuit of higher prize money, formed the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC). Like the BDO, the PDC organises their tournaments as well as their world championship.\n\nIn soft-tip, the World Soft Darts Association serves as a governing body of the sport, with events feature players that play also steel-tip in PDC and BDO events and other players that compete exclusively in soft-tip events.\n\n===Amateur league organisations===\nThe American Darts Organization promulgates rules and standards for amateur league darts and sanctions tournaments in the United States. The American Darts Organization began operation January 1, 1976, with 30 charter member clubs and a membership of 7,500 players. Today, the ADO has a membership that averages 250 clubs yearly representing roughly 50,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adodarts.com/history/ |title=American Darts Organization Official Website |work=ADO darts |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225113715/http://www.adodarts.com/history/ |archive-date=25 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n==Professional play==\nSince the demise of the [[News of the World Darts Championship]] and other past major tournaments The BDO and PDC both organise a televised [[World Professional Darts Championship|World Professional Championship]]. They are held annually over the Christmas/New Year period, with the PDC championship finishing slightly earlier than the BDO tournament. The [[BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Championship]] has been running since 1978; the [[PDC World Darts Championship|PDC World Championship]] started in 1994.\n\nBoth organisations hold other professional tournaments. The BDO organise the [[Winmau World Masters|World Masters]] and many Open tournaments. They also organise county darts for their 66 [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] members in the UK including individual and team events.\n\nThe PDC's major tournaments are the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]], [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]], [[PDC UK Open Darts|UK Open]], [[Stan James World Matchplay|World Matchplay]], [[PDC World Grand Prix Darts|World Grand Prix]] and the [[Grand Slam of Darts]]. All of these are broadcast live on Sky Sports television in the UK. They also hold PDC Pro Tour events and smaller category events around the UK.\n\nTwo Dutch independently organised major tournaments, the [[International Darts League]] and the [[World Darts Trophy]] introduced a mix of BDO and PDC players in 2006 and 2007. Both organisations allocated rankings to the tournaments, but these two events are now discontinued.\n\nThe [[WDF World Cup darts|WDF World Cup]] for national teams and a singles tournament has been played biennially since 1977. The WDF also organise the Europe Cup. The [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] has their world cup competition, the [[PDC World Cup of Darts]].\n\nFor soft-tip darts, WSDA and DARTSLIVE run THE WORLD, an international tour which serves as the Soft Darts World Championship, with the final tournament referred to as the Grand Final, with the circuit first taking place in 2011. Stages take place mostly in East Asia, with some rounds held in the United States and Europe. Matches during WSDA events are played with both 701 and Cricket during a set, usually with the same number of games of each, giving both players throws during both formats, and the final round determined by player choice.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://darts-theworld.com/|title=THE WORLD|website=THE

Points can be scored in the game by hitting specific marked areas of the board, though, unlike sports such as [[Archery]], these are randomly allocated throughout the board and do not follow a common principle of points increasing towards the centre of the board. Though a number of similar games using various boards and rules exist, the term \"darts\" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules. \n\nAs well as being a professional competitive sport, darts is a traditional [[pub game]].

Their slenderness makes them better for grouping, but because they are long, the centre of gravity is further back.\n* Ton-shaped barrels are thin at either end and bulge in the middle. This makes them fatter than a cylindrical barrel of equivalent weight but the centre of gravity is further forward and so theoretically easier to throw.\n* Torpedo-shaped barrels are widest at the pointed end and taper towards the rear. This shape keeps the bulk of the weight as far forward as possible but, like the ton, gives it a larger diameter than the cylinder.\n\nThe shafts are manufactured in various lengths, and some are designed to be cut to length. Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible.<ref name=\"china3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadart.com/dart_accessories_shaft.htm |title=Shafts |publisher=Chinadart |accessdate=12 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111155944/http://www.chinadart.com/dart_accessories_shaft.htm |archive-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Longer shafts provide greater stability and allow a reduction in flight size which in turn can lead to closer grouping; but, they also shift the weight towards the rear causing the dart to tilt backwards during flight, requiring a harder, faster throw.\n\nThe flight stabilizes the dart by producing [[Drag (physics)|drag]], thus preventing the rear of the dart from overtaking the point.<ref name=\"Dartsworld\" /> Modern flights are generally made from plastic, nylon, or foil and are available in a range of shapes and sizes. The three most common shapes in order of size are the standard, the kite, and the smaller pear shape. The less surface area, the less stability but larger flights hamper close grouping. Some manufacturers have sought to solve this by making a flight long and thin but this, in turn, creates other problems such as changing the dart's centre of gravity. Generally speaking, a heavier dart will require a larger flight.<ref name=\"Dartsworld\" />\n\nThe choice of barrel, shaft, and flight will depend a great deal on the individual player's throwing style.

If the face projects outward from the wall, due to the thickness of the board and/or a cabinet in which it is mounted, the oche must be moved back appropriately to maintain the required distance.\n\nThe regulations came about due to the United Kingdom and the rest of the world playing at different lengths, with {{cvt|2.37|m|ftin|frac=4}} being the compromise length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartswdf.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2018-02-28_WDF_Playing_Tournament_Rules_rev_20.pdf|title=World Darts Federation Playing and Tournament Rules Twentieth Revised Edition|date=28 February 2018|website=www.dartswdf.com|access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Scoring==\n[[File:Dartboard_heatmap.svg|thumb|Scores for each region of a dartboard (not to scale) shaded by value]]\nThe standard dartboard is divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. The dartboard featured on ''[[The Indoor League]]'' television show of the 1970s did not feature a triple section, and according to host [[Fred Trueman]] during the first episode, this is the traditional Yorkshire board.\n\nVarious games can be played (and still are played informally) using the standard dartboard. However, in the official game, any dart landing inside the outer wire scores as follows:\n*Hitting one of the large portions of each of the numbered sections, traditionally alternately coloured black and white, scores the points value of that section.\n* Hitting the thin inner portions of these sections, roughly halfway between the outer wire and the central circle coloured red or green, scores triple the points value of that section.\n* Hitting the thin outer portions of these sections, again coloured red or green, scores double the points value of that section. The double-20 is often referred to as double-top, reflecting the 20's position on the dartboard.\n*The central circle is divided into a green outer ring worth 25 points (known as \"outer\", \"outer bull\", or \"single bull\") and a red or black inner circle (usually known as \"bull\", \"inner bull\" or \"double bull\"), worth 50 points. The term \"bullseye\" can mean either the whole central part of the board or just the inner red/black section. The term \"bull's ring\" usually means just the green outer ring. The inner bull counts as a double when doubling in or out.\n*Hitting outside the outer wire scores nothing.\n* A dart only scores if its point is embedded in or is touching the playing surface. This rule applies to any dart that lands in such a way as to be partially or totally supported by others that have already hit the board.\n* When a standard board is used, any dart whose point does not remain in contact with the playing surface until being collected by the player does not score. This includes darts that bounce off the board for any reason, that fall off on their own, or that are dislodged by the impact of later throws. However, when an electronic board is used, fallen/dislodged darts do score as long as their impacts have registered on the board first.\n\nThe highest score possible with three darts is 180, commonly known as a \"ton 80\" (100 points is called a ton), obtained when all three darts land in the triple 20. In the [[television|televised]] game, the [[referee]] frequently announces a score of 180 in exuberant style. A \"quad\" ring appeared briefly between the triple ring and the bull in the 1990s, leading to a potential ''240'' maximum (three quad-20s), a ''210'' maximum checkout (Q20-Q20-Bull) and ''seven'' dart finishes from a 501 start (five quad-20s, triple-17, bullseye), but was swiftly dropped from professional tournament play after only two years.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qzifRI2UrI|title=Jocky Wilson Only 240 Ever Seen vs John Lowe Skol World Matchplay|date=16 November 2013|work=YouTube|access-date=22 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218120128/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qzifRI2UrI|archive-date=18 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> One make of this board was the Harrows Quadro 240.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crowsdarts.com/reviews/quadro.html|title=QUADRO Dartboard|author=Tim Cronian|work=crowsdarts.com|access-date=2014-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223233244/http://www.crowsdarts.com/reviews/quadro.html|archive-date=2015-02-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Skill level and aiming===\n[[Image:Optimal Dart Throw Location Skill Level.jpg|thumb|Path of the optimal location to throw a dart where \u03c3 = 0 is a perfect player and \u03c3 = 100 is a player who throws randomly.]]\nAssuming standard scoring, the optimal area to aim for on the dartboard to maximize the player's score varies significantly based on the player's skill. The skilled player should aim for the centre of the T20, and as the player's skill decreases, their aim moves slightly up and to the left of the T20. At \u03c3 = 16.4&nbsp;mm the best place to aim jumps to the T19. As the player's skill decreases further, the best place to aim curls into the centre of the board, stopping a bit lower than and to the left of the bullseye at \u03c3 = 100.<ref>Ryan J. Tibshirani, Andrew Price, and Jonathan Taylor (January 2011) [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ryantibs/papers/darts.pdf \"A statistician plays darts\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050313/http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~ryantibs/papers/darts.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}, ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'', series A, vol. 174, no. 1, pages 213\u2013226</ref>\n\nWhere [[\u03c3]]  may refer to the [[standard deviation]] for a specific population: [[List of darts players]].\n\n==Games==\nMany games can be played on a dartboard, but the term \"darts\" generally refers to a game in which one player at a time throws three darts per turn. The throwing player must stand so that no portion of his/her feet extends past the leading edge of the oche, but may stand on any other portion and/or lean forward over it if desired.\n\nA game of darts is generally contested between two players, who take turns. The most common objective is to reduce a fixed score, commonly 301 or 501, to zero (\"checking out\"). The final dart must land in either the bullseye or a double segment to win. Not all three darts need to be thrown on the final turn, the game can be finished on any of the three darts. When two teams play, the starting score is sometimes increased to 701 or even 1001; the rules remain the same.\n\nA throw that reduces a player's score below zero, to exactly one, or to zero but not ending with a double is known as \"going bust\", with the player's score being reset to the value before starting the turn, and the remainder of the turn being forfeited.\n\nIn some variants (called a \"northern bust\" in London) only the dart that causes the bust is not counted. That is felt by some to be a purer version of the game, as under the normal rules, as explained above, a player left with a difficult finish, e.g. 5 and one dart remaining will often deliberately \"bust\" it to get back to the easier finish that they had at the start of their go. For example, a player with 20 at the start of their go could miss the double 10 and get a single, miss the double 5 and get a single, leaving them 5 and only one dart remaining. Their best option is to deliberately bust it to get back onto double 10. Under the \"northern bust\" they would remain on 5.\n\nA darts match is played over a fixed number of games, known as legs. A match may be divided into sets, with each set being contested as over a fixed number of legs.\n\nAlthough playing straight down from 501 is standard in darts, sometimes a double must be hit to begin scoring, known as \"doubling in\", with all darts thrown before hitting a double not being counted. The PDC's [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]] uses this format.\n\nThe minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common [[nine dart finish]] consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. Three 167s (T20-T19-Bull) is considered a pure or perfect nine-dart finish by some players.\n\n===Other games and variants===\nThere are several regional variations on the standard rules and scoring systems.\n\n====American darts====\n{{Main article|American Darts}}\nAmerican Darts is a regional USA variant of the game (most U.S. dart players play the traditional games described above). This style of dartboard is most often found in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New York state.\n\n====Cricket====\n{{Main article|Cricket (darts)}}\n\nCricket is a widely played darts game involving a race to control and score on numbers between 20 and 15 and the bullseye, by hitting each of these targets for three marks to ''open'' or ''own'' it for scoring.  A hit on the target counts as one mark, while hits in the doubles ring of the target count as two marks in one throw, and on the triples ring as three. Once opened in this manner, until the opponent ''closes'' that number with three marks on it of their own, each additional hit by the owner/opener scores points equal to the number of the target (which may also be doubled and tripled, e.g. a triple-20 is worth 60 points).  The outer bullseye counts as 25 points and the inner as 50.\n\n====Dartball====\n{{Main article|Dartball}}\nDartball is a darts game based on the sport of [[baseball]]. It is played on a diamond-shaped board and has similar scoring to baseball.\n\n====Dart golf====\n{{Main article|Dart golf}}\nDart golf is a darts game based on the sport of [[golf]] and is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF).<ref>\"History of Dolf\" http://www.dolfdarts.com/history-of-dolf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315060702/http://www.dolfdarts.com/history-of-dolf |date=2012-03-15 }}</ref> It is played on both special golf dartboards and traditional dartboards. Scoring is similar to golf.\n\n====Fives====\n[[Image:FivesDartboard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An '[[East End of London|East-End]]' or 'Fives' dartboard]]\nThis is a regional variant still played in some parts of the East End of London. The board has fewer, larger segments, all numbered either 5, 10, 15 or 20.

Initially, each player throws a dart at the board with their non-dominant hand to obtain their 'number'. No two players can have the same number. Once everyone has a number, each player takes it in turn to get their number five times with their three darts (doubles count twice, and triples three times). Once a person has reached 5, they become a 'killer'. This means they can aim for other peoples numbers, taking a point off for each time they hit (doubles x2, triples x3). If a person gets to zero they are out. A killer can aim for anyone's numbers, even another killer's. Players cannot get more than 5 points. The winner is 'the last man standing'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/world_darts_2004/3334207.stm |title=Board of brilliant versatility |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=2010-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714045548/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/world_darts_2004/3334207.stm |archive-date=14 July 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAnother version of \"Killer\" is a \"knock-out\" game for three or more players (the more the better). To start, everyone has a pre-determined number of lives, (usually 5) and a randomly chosen player throws a single dart at the board to set a target (i.e. single 18) and does not play until that target is hit. The next player up has 3 darts to try and hit the target (single 18), if they fail, they lose a life and the following player tries. Once a player succeeds at hitting the target, they then become the target setter and throw a dart to set a new target. The initial target setter swaps places with the new target setter. The games carries on until every players' lives have been used, the last man standing is the target setter whose target was not hit.  For less experienced players you can count doubles and trebles as part of the same number, i.e. a target of treble 20 can still be counted as a success if the double or single 20 is hit and vice versa.\n\n====Lawn darts====\n{{main article|Lawn darts}}\nLawn darts (also called Jarts or yard darts) is a lawn game based on darts. The gameplay and objective are similar to both [[horseshoes]] and darts.

A Fairer Start for Shanghai: To prevent players from becoming too practised at shooting for the 1, the number sequence can begin at the number of the dart that lost the throw for the bullseye to determine the starting thrower. For example; Thrower A shoots for the bullseye and hits the 17. Thrower B shoots for the bullseye and hits it. Thrower B then begins the game, starting on the number 17, then 18, 19, 20, 1, 2, 3, etc. through 16 (if no player hits Shanghai).\n\n==Darts organisations==\n===Professional organisations===\n{{Main article|Split in darts}}\nOf the two [[professional]] steel-tip organisations, the [[British Darts Organisation]] (BDO), founded in 1973, is the older. Its tournaments were often shown on the [[BBC]] in the UK. The BDO is a member of the [[World Darts Federation]] (WDF) (founded 1976), along with organizations in some 60 other countries worldwide. The BDO originally organised a number of the more prestigious British tournaments with a few notable exceptions such as the News of the World Championship and the national events run under the auspices of the National Darts Association of Great Britain. However, many sponsors were lost and British TV coverage became much reduced by the early nineties. As of 24 September 2016, the BBC no longer broadcasts the BDO World Championship.\n\nIn 1992, a group of darts players broke off from the BDO and, in pursuit of higher prize money, formed the [[Professional Darts Corporation]] (PDC). Like the BDO, the PDC organises their tournaments as well as their world championship.\n\nIn soft-tip, the World Soft Darts Association serves as a governing body of the sport, with events feature players that play also steel-tip in PDC and BDO events and other players that compete exclusively in soft-tip events.\n\n===Amateur league organisations===\nThe American Darts Organization promulgates rules and standards for amateur league darts and sanctions tournaments in the United States. The American Darts Organization began operation January 1, 1976, with 30 charter member clubs and a membership of 7,500 players. Today, the ADO has a membership that averages 250 clubs yearly representing roughly 50,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adodarts.com/history/ |title=American Darts Organization Official Website |work=ADO darts |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225113715/http://www.adodarts.com/history/ |archive-date=25 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n==Professional play==\nSince the demise of the [[News of the World Darts Championship]] and other past major tournaments The BDO and PDC both organise a televised [[World Professional Darts Championship|World Professional Championship]]. They are held annually over the Christmas/New Year period, with the PDC championship finishing slightly earlier than the BDO tournament. The [[BDO World Darts Championship|BDO World Championship]] has been running since 1978; the [[PDC World Darts Championship|PDC World Championship]] started in 1994.\n\nBoth organisations hold other professional tournaments. The BDO organise the [[Winmau World Masters|World Masters]] and many Open tournaments. They also organise county darts for their 66 [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] members in the UK including individual and team events.\n\nThe PDC's major tournaments are the [[PDC World Darts Championship|World Championship]], [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]], [[PDC UK Open Darts|UK Open]], [[Stan James World Matchplay|World Matchplay]], [[PDC World Grand Prix Darts|World Grand Prix]] and the [[Grand Slam of Darts]]. All of these are broadcast live on Sky Sports television in the UK. They also hold PDC Pro Tour events and smaller category events around the UK.\n\nTwo Dutch independently organised major tournaments, the [[International Darts League]] and the [[World Darts Trophy]] introduced a mix of BDO and PDC players in 2006 and 2007. Both organisations allocated rankings to the tournaments, but these two events are now discontinued.\n\nThe [[WDF World Cup darts|WDF World Cup]] for national teams and a singles tournament has been played biennially since 1977. The WDF also organise the Europe Cup. The [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]] has their world cup competition, the [[PDC World Cup of Darts]].\n\nFor soft-tip darts, WSDA and DARTSLIVE run THE WORLD, an international tour which serves as the Soft Darts World Championship, with the final tournament referred to as the Grand Final, with the circuit first taking place in 2011. Stages take place mostly in East Asia, with some rounds held in the United States and Europe. Matches during WSDA events are played with both 701 and Cricket during a set, usually with the same number of games of each, giving both players throws during both formats, and the final round determined by player choice.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://darts-theworld.com/|title=THE WORLD|website=THE

The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, [[Pliny the Younger]], who at that point was staying at [[Misenum]], on the other side of the Bay of Naples about {{convert|29|km}} from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, [[pyroclastic flow]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\n\n<blockquote>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of [[Vesuvius]]; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancient-literature.com/rome_pliny_epistulae_VI16.html |title=Pliny the Younger, Epistulae VI.16 & VI.20 |website=Ancient Literature |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Stratigraphic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|350px|right|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown; [[Pliny the Younger]] was at [[Misenum]].]]\n\nSigur\u00f0sson, Cashdollar, and [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Sparks]] undertook a detailed stratigraphic study of the layers of ash, based on excavations and surveys, which was published in 1982. Their conclusion was that the eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD unfolded in two phases, [[Vesuvian eruption|Vesuvian]] and [[Pelean eruption|Pelean]], which alternated six times. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Haraldur |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first2=Stanford |last2=Cashdollar |first3=R.

Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep layer, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. [[Herculaneum]] and [[Oplontis]] received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments up to {{convert|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} deep. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nThe eruption is viewed as primarily [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]], where the chief energy supporting the blast column came from escaping steam created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, coming into contact with hot magma.\n\n====Timing of explosions====\n\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigur\u00f0sson and Casey concluded that an early explosion produced a column of ash and pumice which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum, which was upwind.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002}}</ref> Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents.\n\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing [[Rectina]] to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\n\n=== Magnetic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Wn\u0119trze krateru Wezuwiusz.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the crater of Vesuvius]]\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200&nbsp;samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the {{nowrap|deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}.</ref>}} The deposits were placed by [[pyroclastic density current]]s (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAll crystal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it [[ferromagnetic]], as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are [[magnetic dipole]]s, are held in alignment by being bound in a [[crystal]]line structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=10}}.</ref> Heating the material adds [[internal energy]] to it. At the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever [[magnetic field]] might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \"block out\" non-residual fields.\n\nA [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a [[spectrum]] of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in 79 AD. The overall field of the sample was the [[vector sum]] of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\n\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of {{nowrap|{{convert|40|C-change|sigfig=1}}}} from {{convert|100|C|F|sigfig=2}} until it reached the low unblocking temperature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=8}}.</ref> Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \"fabric\" of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows:\n\n* On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in|sigfig=1}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}.</ref> It heated the roof tiles to {{convert|120|-|140|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}.</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\n\n* Early in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was {{convert|180|-|220|C|sigfig=2}}, minimum temperatures; of the second, {{convert|220|-|260|C|sigfig=2}}. The depositional temperature of the first was {{convert|140|-|300|C|sigfig=2}}. Upstream and downstream of the flow it was {{convert|300|-|360|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C|sigfig=3}}, the boiling point of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}.</ref> The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one metre more of deposits fell over the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\n==The Two Plinys==\n[[Image:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by [[Pliny the Younger]], who was 17 at the time of the eruption,<ref>His 18th year by Roman reckoning, as they counted the first 12 months as the first year</ref> to the historian [[Tacitus]] and written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= C.

[...] it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as it was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.}}\n\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor woke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\", which is evidence for a [[tsunami]]. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\n{{further information|Pliny the Elder}}\n\nPliny's uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Bassus{{fact|date=April 2020}}) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast.

Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \"[[Fortune favours the bold|Fortune favors the brave]]\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} from Pompeii), where [[Pomponianus]] was.<ref name=PYVI.16/> Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.<ref name=PYVI.16/> \n\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress.<ref name=PYVI.16/> They woke Pliny, who had been napping and snoring loudly. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again, but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise, even with assistance. His friends then departed, escaping ultimately by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm | author = Richard V.

The large majority of extant medieval manuscript copies \u2013 there are no surviving Roman copies \u2013 indicate a date corresponding to August 24, and from the discovery of the cities into the 21st century this was accepted by most scholars and by nearly all books written about Pompeii and Herculaneum for the general public.\n\nSince at least the late [[18th century]], a minority among archaeologists and other scientists have suggested that the eruption began ''after'' August 24, during the autumn, perhaps in October or November. In 1797 the researcher Carlo Rosini reported that excavations at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] had uncovered traces of fruits and [[braziers]] indicative of the autumn, not the summer. \n\nMore recently, in 1990 and 2001, archaeologists discovered more remnants of autumnal fruits (such as the pomegranate), the remains of victims of the eruption in heavy clothing, and large earthenware storage vessels laden with wine (at the time of their burial by Vesuvius).

Given the limited space on each coin, his achievements were stamped on the coins using an arcane encoding.

The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, [[Pliny the Younger]], who at that point was staying at [[Misenum]], on the other side of the Bay of Naples about {{convert|29|km}} from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning.\n\nAround 1:00&nbsp;p.m., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, [[pyroclastic flow]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating the remaining population and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\n\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\n\n<blockquote>Broad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of [[Vesuvius]]; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancient-literature.com/rome_pliny_epistulae_VI16.html |title=Pliny the Younger, Epistulae VI.16 & VI.20 |website=Ancient Literature |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Stratigraphic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|350px|right|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Modern coast lines are shown; [[Pliny the Younger]] was at [[Misenum]].]]\n\nSigur\u00f0sson, Cashdollar, and [[Robert Stephen John Sparks|Sparks]] undertook a detailed stratigraphic study of the layers of ash, based on excavations and surveys, which was published in 1982. Their conclusion was that the eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD unfolded in two phases, [[Vesuvian eruption|Vesuvian]] and [[Pelean eruption|Pelean]], which alternated six times. <ref>{{cite journal|first=Haraldur |last=Sigur\u00f0sson |first2=Stanford |last2=Cashdollar |first3=R.

Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep layer, burning and asphyxiating any living beings who had remained behind. [[Herculaneum]] and [[Oplontis]] received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine pyroclastic deposits, pulverized pumice and lava fragments up to {{convert|20|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} deep. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002|pp=42\u201343}}.</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\n\nThe eruption is viewed as primarily [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic]], where the chief energy supporting the blast column came from escaping steam created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, coming into contact with hot magma.\n\n====Timing of explosions====\n\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigur\u00f0sson and Casey concluded that an early explosion produced a column of ash and pumice which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum, which was upwind.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigur\u00f0sson|2002}}</ref> Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents.\n\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing [[Rectina]] to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\n\n=== Magnetic studies ===\n{{one source|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Wn\u0119trze krateru Wezuwiusz.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the crater of Vesuvius]]\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200&nbsp;samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the {{nowrap|deposits.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}.</ref>}} The deposits were placed by [[pyroclastic density current]]s (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over {{convert|2|\u2013|5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAll crystal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it [[ferromagnetic]], as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are [[magnetic dipole]]s, are held in alignment by being bound in a [[crystal]]line structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=10}}.</ref> Heating the material adds [[internal energy]] to it. At the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]], the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever [[magnetic field]] might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \"block out\" non-residual fields.\n\nA [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a [[spectrum]] of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in 79 AD. The overall field of the sample was the [[vector sum]] of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\n\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of {{nowrap|{{convert|40|C-change|sigfig=1}}}} from {{convert|100|C|F|sigfig=2}} until it reached the low unblocking temperature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=8}}.</ref> Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|pp=9\u201310}}.</ref> That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \"fabric\" of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows:\n\n* On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in|sigfig=1}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}.</ref> It heated the roof tiles to {{convert|120|-|140|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}.</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\n\n* Early in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was {{convert|180|-|220|C|sigfig=2}}, minimum temperatures; of the second, {{convert|220|-|260|C|sigfig=2}}. The depositional temperature of the first was {{convert|140|-|300|C|sigfig=2}}. Upstream and downstream of the flow it was {{convert|300|-|360|C|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C|sigfig=3}}, the boiling point of water.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}.</ref> The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\n\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one metre more of deposits fell over the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\n==The Two Plinys==\n[[Image:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]\n\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by [[Pliny the Younger]], who was 17 at the time of the eruption,<ref>His 18th year by Roman reckoning, as they counted the first 12 months as the first year</ref> to the historian [[Tacitus]] and written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref>{{cite book|author= C.

[...] it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark and spotted, according as it was either more or less impregnated with earth and cinders.}}\n\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor woke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\", which is evidence for a [[tsunami]]. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\n\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\n\n=== Pliny the Elder ===\n{{further information|Pliny the Elder}}\n\nPliny's uncle [[Pliny the Elder]] was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Bassus{{fact|date=April 2020}}) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.<ref name=PYVI.16>{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|chapter=VI.16 To Tacitus|title=Letters|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html}}</ref> Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast.

Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \"[[Fortune favours the bold|Fortune favors the brave]]\" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} from Pompeii), where [[Pomponianus]] was.<ref name=PYVI.16/> Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.<ref name=PYVI.16/> \n\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages.

They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again, but the wind had not changed.

These people were concentrated in the vaults at a density as high as three per square metre and were all caught by the first surge, dying of thermal shock and partly carbonised by later and hotter surges.

La vera data dell'eruzione. Archeo</ref>\n\nVesuvius and its destructive eruption are mentioned in first-century Roman sources, but not the day of the eruption.

This date came from a 1508 printed version of a letter between [[Pliny the Younger]] and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]], written some 25 years after the event.<ref>Delphi Complete Works of Pliny the Younger, 2014, Volume 28 of Delphi Ancient Classics</ref><ref name=\"plinyletter\">{{cite book |last1=Pliny the Younger |title=Letters 6.16 and 6.20 |publisher=University of Arizona |edition=Penguin, translated by B.

Over fourteen centuries of manuscript hand-copying up to the 1508 printing of his letters, the date given in Pliny's original letter may have been corrupted. Manuscript experts believe that the date originally given by Pliny was one of August 24, October 30, November 1, or November 23.<ref name=\"berrypompei\">{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=Joanne |title=The Complete Pompeii |date=2013 |publisher=Thames & Hudson Ltd. |location=London |isbn=978-0500290927 |page=20}}</ref> This odd scattered set of dates is due to the Romans' [[Roman calendar#Days|convention for describing calendar dates]]. The large majority of extant medieval manuscript copies \u2013 there are no surviving Roman copies \u2013 indicate a date corresponding to August 24, and from the discovery of the cities into the 21st century this was accepted by most scholars and by nearly all books written about Pompeii and Herculaneum for the general public.\n\nSince at least the late [[18th century]], a minority among archaeologists and other scientists have suggested that the eruption began ''after'' August 24, during the autumn, perhaps in October or November. In 1797 the researcher Carlo Rosini reported that excavations at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] had uncovered traces of fruits and [[braziers]] indicative of the autumn, not the summer. \n\nMore recently, in 1990 and 2001, archaeologists discovered more remnants of autumnal fruits (such as the pomegranate), the remains of victims of the eruption in heavy clothing, and large earthenware storage vessels laden with wine (at the time of their burial by Vesuvius). The wine-related discovery may show that the eruption was after the year's grape harvest and wine making.<ref name=\"journalvolcanology\">{{harvnb|Rolandi|2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a study of prevailing winds in Campania showed that the southeasterly debris pattern of the first-century eruption is quite consistent with an autumn event, and inconsistent with an August date. During June, July, and August, the prevailing winds flow to the west \u2013 an arc between the southwest and northwest \u2013 virtually all the time.<ref name=journalvolcanology /> (Note that the [[Julian calendar]] was in place throughout the first century AD \u2013 that is, the months of the Roman calendar were aligned with the seasons.)\n\nAs [[Titus#Challenges|Emperor Titus]] of the [[Flavian dynasty]] (reigning [[June 24]], 79 to September 13, 81) garnered victories on the battlefield (including his capture of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]]), and other honors, his administration issued coins enumerating his ever-growing accolades. Given the limited space on each coin, his achievements were stamped on the coins using an arcane encoding. Two of these coins, from early in Titus' reign, were found in a hoard recovered at Pompeii's House of the Golden Bracelet. Although the coins' minting dates are somewhat in dispute,<ref name=journalvolcanology /> a numismatic expert at the [[British Museum]], Richard Abdy, concluded that the latest coin in the hoard was minted on or after June 24 (the first date of Titus' reign) and before September 1 of 79 AD.

It is composed almost entirely of [[Sampling (music)|samples]], mostly from vinyl records, and features moody, slow tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of Shadow's early [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] influences. Shadow produced ''Endtroducing'' over two years using minimal equipment, primarily an [[MPC60]] sampler.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where DJ Shadow had already established himself as a rising act, ''Endtroducing'' received critical acclaim and peaked in the top twenty of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry]]. Mo' Wax issued four singles, including the chart hits \"[[Midnight in a Perfect World]]\" and \"[[Stem (DJ Shadow song)|Stem]]\". \n\nIt took considerably longer for ''Endtroducing'' to find success in the United States. After promoting the album and returning to his hometown of [[Davis, California]], Shadow devoted his time to creating new music. During this period, interest in ''Endtroducing'' began to build among the American music press, and it peaked at 37 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart.\n\n''Endtroducing'' was ranked highly on various lists of the best albums of 1996, and appears in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of the 1990s. It is considered a landmark work in [[instrumental hip hop]], with Shadow's sampling techniques and arrangements leaving a lasting influence.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:DJ Shadow and James

It is composed almost entirely of [[Sampling (music)|samples]], mostly from vinyl records, and features moody, slow tracks and upbeat jams reminiscent of Shadow's early [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] influences. Shadow produced ''Endtroducing'' over two years using minimal equipment, primarily an [[MPC60]] sampler.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where DJ Shadow had already established himself as a rising act, ''Endtroducing'' received critical acclaim and peaked in the top twenty of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry]]. Mo' Wax issued four singles, including the chart hits \"[[Midnight in a Perfect World]]\" and \"[[Stem (DJ Shadow song)|Stem]]\". \n\nIt took considerably longer for ''Endtroducing'' to find success in the United States. After promoting the album and returning to his hometown of [[Davis, California]], Shadow devoted his time to creating new music. During this period, interest in ''Endtroducing'' began to build among the American music press, and it peaked at 37 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart.\n\n''Endtroducing'' was ranked highly on various lists of the best albums of 1996, and appears in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of the 1990s. It is considered a landmark work in [[instrumental hip hop]], with Shadow's sampling techniques and arrangements leaving a lasting influence.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:DJ Shadow and James

It includes both Wright and Patterson Fields, which were originally [[Wilbur Wright Field]] and Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot. Patterson Field is approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast of [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]; Wright Field is approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast of Dayton.\n\nThe host unit at Wright-Patterson AFB is the [[88th Air Base Wing]] (88 ABW), assigned to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center and [[Air Force Materiel Command]]. The 88 ABW operates the airfield, maintains all infrastructure and provides security, communications, medical, legal, personnel, contracting, finance, transportation, air traffic control, weather forecasting, public affairs, recreation and chaplain services for more than 60 associate units.\n\nThe base's origins begin with the establishment of Wilbur Wright Field on 22 May and '''McCook Field''' in November 1917, both established by the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] as [[World War I]] installations. McCook was used as a testing field and for aviation experiments. Wright was used as a flying field (renamed Patterson Field in 1931); Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot; armorers' school, and a temporary storage depot. McCook's functions were transferred to Wright Field when it was closed in October 1927.<ref>World War I Group, Historical Division, Special Staff, United States Army, Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War (1917\u20131919)</ref> Wright-Patterson AFB was established in 1948 as a merger of Patterson and Wright Fields.\n\nIn 1995, negotiations to end the [[Bosnian War]] were held at the base, resulting in the [[Dayton Agreement]] that ended the war.\n\nThe 88th Air Base Wing is commanded by Col.

The Hilltop area was acquired from private landowners in 1943\u20131944 to provide troop housing and services. <!--The Materiel Command, headquartered at Wright Field, was responsible for the procurement of airplanes and equipment in production quantities and for sustaining an accelerated program of testing and development.

It includes both Wright and Patterson Fields, which were originally [[Wilbur Wright Field]] and Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot. Patterson Field is approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast of [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]; Wright Field is approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast of Dayton.\n\nThe host unit at Wright-Patterson AFB is the [[88th Air Base Wing]] (88 ABW), assigned to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center and [[Air Force Materiel Command]]. The 88 ABW operates the airfield, maintains all infrastructure and provides security, communications, medical, legal, personnel, contracting, finance, transportation, air traffic control, weather forecasting, public affairs, recreation and chaplain services for more than 60 associate units.\n\nThe base's origins begin with the establishment of Wilbur Wright Field on 22 May and '''McCook Field''' in November 1917, both established by the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]] as [[World War I]] installations. McCook was used as a testing field and for aviation experiments. Wright was used as a flying field (renamed Patterson Field in 1931); Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot; armorers' school, and a temporary storage depot. McCook's functions were transferred to Wright Field when it was closed in October 1927.<ref>World War I Group, Historical Division, Special Staff, United States Army, Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War (1917\u20131919)</ref> Wright-Patterson AFB was established in 1948 as a merger of Patterson and Wright Fields.\n\nIn 1995, negotiations to end the [[Bosnian War]] were held at the base, resulting in the [[Dayton Agreement]] that ended the war.\n\nThe 88th Air Base Wing is commanded by Col.
