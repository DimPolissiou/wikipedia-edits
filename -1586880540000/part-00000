{"title_page": "Pomponius Secundus", "text_new": "'''Publius Pomponius Secundus''' was a distinguished statesman and poet in the reigns of [[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], and [[Claudius]]. He was [[Roman consul|suffect consul]] for the ''[[nundinium]]'' of January-June 44, succeeding the ordinary consul [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]] and as the colleague of the other ordinary consul, [[Titus Statilius Taurus (consul 44)|Titus Statilius Taurus]].<ref>Gallivan, \"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\", pp. 408, 424.</ref> Publius was on intimate terms with the [[Pliny the Elder|elder Pliny]], who wrote a biography of him, now lost.\n\n==Name==\nHis full name was '''Publius Calvisius Sabinus Pomponius Secundus''', as indicated by two fragmentary inscriptions from [[Germania Superior]].<ref>{{CIL|13|5201}}, {{CIL|13|11515}}.</ref> For some time, Pomponius' praenomen was uncertain; ''Publius'' was not a regular name of the Pompilii, and Olli Salomies discusses the possibility that it might have been '''Gaius''', but notes that a Publius Calvisius Sabinus was attested as existing in [[Spoletium]], and concludes that it is \"possible to assume with some confidence\" that he had been adopted by a Publius Calvisius Sabinus.<ref>Salomies, ''Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature'', p. 114</ref>  That his praenomen was ''Publius'', at least after his adoption, seems to be confirmed by an inscription from [[Veii]], dating from his consulship, another from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrenae]], when he was [[proconsul]], and one from [[Mogontiacum]], when he was ''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''.<ref>{{CIL|11|3806}}, {{AE|1963|142}}, {{AE|1996|1175}}.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nPomponius' mother was [[Vistilia]], who by other marriages was the mother of [[Publius Suillius Rufus]] and the general [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]]. The name of his father is not known, but [[Ronald Syme]] has suggested he could be either [[Gaius Pomponius Graecinus]], consul ''suffectus'' in AD 16, or his brother, [[Lucius Pomponius Flaccus]], consul ''ordinarius'' in 17.<ref>Syme, \"Domitius Corbulo\", p. 31</ref> Pomponius' brother, [[Quintus Pomponius Secundus]], was involved in various intrigues during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius.  Quintus tried to protect his brother from Tiberius' displeasure.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', vi. 18, xiii. 43.</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nPomponius was one of the friends of [[Sejanus]], who was consul in 31, and on the latter's fall in October of that year, Pomponius was placed under house arrest, where he remained until Caligula released him.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', lix. 6, 29.</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', v.8, vi.18.</ref> During either the reign of Caligula or Claudius he was governor of the public province of [[Creta et Cyrenaica]].<ref>Eck, \"\u00dcber die pr\u00e4torischen Prokonsulate in der Kaiserzeit\".</ref> It was during the reign of Claudius that Pomponius acceded to the consulship. He was afterwards governor of [[Germania Superior]] from the year 50 to 54; during his office Pomponius conducted a successful campaign, described by Tacitus, against the German [[Chatti]], where, after forty years, survivors of the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] were freed from slavery. For this he received ''ornamenta triumphalia''.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', xii.27, 28</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nIt was by his tragedies that Secundus obtained the most celebrity. They are spoken of in the highest terms by Tacitus, [[Quintilian]], and the younger [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], and were read even in a much later age, as one of them is quoted by the grammarian [[Charisius]]. These tragedies were first put on the stage in the time of Claudius. Quintilian asserts that he was far superior to any writer of tragedies he had known, and [[Tacitus]] expresses a high opinion of his literary abilities.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', xi. 13; ''Dialogus de Oratoribus'', 13.</ref><ref>[[Quintilian]], ''Institutio Oratoria'', x. 1. \u00a7 98.</ref><ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', iii. 5, vii. 17.</ref><ref>[[Charisius]], ''apud'' Bothe, ''Po\u00ebtae Scenici Latinorum Fragmenta'', vol. ii. p. 279.</ref>\n\nSecundus devoted much attention to the niceties of grammar and style, on which he was recognized as an authority.

He was [[Roman consul|suffect consul]] for the ''[[nundinium]]'' of January-June 44, succeeding the ordinary consul [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]] and as the colleague of the other ordinary consul, [[Titus Statilius Taurus (consul 44)|Titus Statilius Taurus]].<ref>Gallivan, \"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\", pp. 408, 424.</ref> Publius was on intimate terms with the [[Pliny the Elder|elder Pliny]], who wrote a biography of him, now lost.\n\n==Name==\nHis full name was '''Publius Calvisius Sabinus Pomponius Secundus''', as indicated by two fragmentary inscriptions from [[Germania Superior]].<ref>{{CIL|13|5201}}, {{CIL|13|11515}}.</ref> For some time, Pomponius' praenomen was uncertain; ''Publius'' was not a regular name of the Pompilii, and Olli Salomies discusses the possibility that it might have been '''Gaius''', but notes that a Publius Calvisius Sabinus was attested as existing in [[Spoletium]], and concludes that it is \"possible to assume with some confidence\" that he had been adopted by a Publius Calvisius Sabinus.<ref>Salomies, ''Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature'', p. 114</ref>  That his praenomen was ''Publius'', at least after his adoption, seems to be confirmed by an inscription from [[Veii]], dating from his consulship, another from [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrenae]], when he was [[proconsul]], and one from [[Mogontiacum]], when he was ''[[Legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''.<ref>{{CIL|11|3806}}, {{AE|1963|142}}, {{AE|1996|1175b}}.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nPomponius' mother was [[Vistilia]], who by other marriages was the mother of [[Publius Suillius Rufus]] and the general [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]]. The name of his father is not known, but [[Ronald Syme]] has suggested he could be either [[Gaius Pomponius Graecinus]], consul ''suffectus'' in AD 16, or his brother, [[Lucius Pomponius Flaccus]], consul ''ordinarius'' in 17.<ref>Syme, \"Domitius Corbulo\", p. 31</ref> Pomponius' brother, [[Quintus Pomponius Secundus]], was involved in various intrigues during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius.

He was afterwards governor of [[Germania Superior]] from the year 50 to 54; during his office Pomponius conducted a successful campaign, described by Tacitus, against the German [[Chatti]], where, after forty years, survivors of the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] were freed from slavery. For this he received ''ornamenta triumphalia''.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', xii.27, 28</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nIt was by his tragedies that Secundus obtained the most celebrity. They are spoken of in the highest terms by Tacitus, [[Quintilian]], and the younger [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], and were read even in a much later age, as one of them is quoted by the grammarian [[Charisius]]. These tragedies were first put on the stage in the time of Claudius. Quintilian asserts that he was far superior to any writer of tragedies he had known, and [[Tacitus]] expresses a high opinion of his literary abilities.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annales'', xi. 13; ''Dialogus de Oratoribus'', 13.</ref><ref>[[Quintilian]], ''Institutio Oratoria'', x. 1. \u00a7 98.</ref><ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', iii. 5, vii. 17.</ref><ref>[[Charisius]], ''apud'' Bothe, ''Po\u00ebtae Scenici Latinorum Fragmenta'', vol. ii. p. 279.</ref>\n\nSecundus devoted much attention to the niceties of grammar and style, on which he was recognized as an authority.

Among the works on this theme (in a broad sense) we can cite those of [[Berossus]] (278 B.C.), [[Pliny the Younger]] (79 AD), [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1375), [[Montesquieu]] (1734), [[Thomas Malthus|Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1766 - 1834), [[Edward Gibbon]] (1776), [[Georges Cuvier]], (1821), [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]] (1905), [[Oswald Spengler]] (1918), [[Arnold Toynbee]] (1939), [[G\u00fcnther Anders]] (1956), [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] (1956), [[Leopold Kohr]] (1957), [[Rachel Carson]] (1962), [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich (1969)]], [[Donella Meadows]], [[Dennis Meadows]] & [[J\u00f8rgen Randers]] (1972), [[Ren\u00e9 Dumont]] (1973), [[Hans Jonas]] (1979), [[Joseph Tainter]] (1988), [[Al Gore]] (1992), [[Hubert Reeves]] (2003), [[Richard Posner]] (2004), [[Jared Diamond]] (2005).\n\n==== Arnold J. Toynbee (1889-1975) ====\nIn his monumental (initially published in twelve volumes) and highly controversial work of contemporary historiography entitled \"[[A Study of History]]\" (1972), [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee|Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889-1975) deals with the genesis of civilizations (chap. 2), their growth (chap. 3), their decline (chap. 4), and their disintegration (chap. 5). According to him, the mortality of civilizations is trivial evidence for the historian, as is the fact that they follow one another over a long period of time.\n\n==== Joseph Tainter (born 1949) ====\nIn his book [[The Collapse of Complex Societies]], the anthropologist and historian [[Joseph Tainter]] (1949-) studies the collapse of various civilizations, including that of the Roman Empire, in terms of [[network theory]], [[energy economics|energy economics]] and [[Complex system|complexity theory]]. For Tainter, an increasingly complex society eventually collapses because of the ever-increasing difficulty in solving its problems.\n\n==== Jared Diamond (born 1937) ====\nThe american [[geographer]], [[synthetic theory of evolution|evolutionary]] [[biologist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Jared Diamond]] (1937- )  already evoked the theme of civilizational collapse in his book called ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', published in 2005. By relying on historical cases, notably the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] civilization, the [[Vikings]] and the [[Maya civilization]], Diamond argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues as these civilizations did, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations. This book has had a resonance beyond the United States, despite some criticism<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jarde|date=2005|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|isbn=978-0-241-95868-1|url=http://cpor.org/ce/Diamond%282005%29Collapse-HowSocietiesChooseFailureSuccess.pdf|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>.\n\n=== Modern collapsologists ===\nSince the invention of the term collapsology, many french personalities gravitate in or around the collapsologists' sphere. Not all have the same vision of civilizational collapse, some even reject the term \"collapsologist\", but all agree that contemporary industrial civilization, and the biosphere as a whole, are on the verge of a global crisis of unprecedented proportions. According to them, the process is already under way, and it is now only possible to try to reduce its devastating effects in the near future. The leaders of the movement are [[Yves Cochet]] and [[:fr:Agn\u00e8s Sina\u00ef|Agn\u00e8s Sina\u00ef]] of the [[:fr:Institut Momentum|Momentum Institute]] (a [[think tank]] exploring the causes of environmental and societal risks of collapse of the thermo-industrial civilization and possible actions to adapt to it), and Pablo Servigne and Rapha\u00ebl Stevens who wrote the essay ''How everything can collapse: A manual for our times''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Servigne |first=Pablo |last2=Stevens |first2=Rapha\u00ebl |title=How Everything Can Collapse|publisher=Polity|year=2020|isbn=9781509541393|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>). Arnaud Dorthe is developing a new simulator that is a continuation of the MIT ''World Dynamics'' simulators, entitled ''Apocalypse Dynamics\u2122''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/abak-consulting/acknowledge/apocalypse-dynamics|last1=Dorthe|first1=Arnaud|title=Abak Consulting - Apocalypse dynamics|website=Abak Consulting|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>. \n\nBeyond the french collapsologists (or assimilated) mentioned above, we can quote: [[Aur\u00e9lien Barrau]] (astrophysicist), Philippe Bihouix (engineer, low-tech developer), [[Dominique Bourg]] (philosopher), Val\u00e9rie Cabanes (lawyer, seeking recognition of the crime of [[ecocide]] by the international criminal court), [[Jean-Marc Jancovici]] (energy-climate specialist), [[Paul Jorion]] (anthropologist, sociologist)...\n\nEven if the term remains rather unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world, many publications deal with the same topic (for example the recent David Wallace-Wells' bestseller ''[[The Uninhabitable Earth]]'', probably a mass-market collapsology work without using the term<ref name=\"NYR\"></ref>). It is now gradually spreading on general<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bg27r3/french_collapsology_if_you_didnt_know_this_in/|title=French collapsology \u2013 \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know this, in recent years France has seen a big societal movement around the idea that we are approaching a collapse.\u201d|date=2019-04-22|website=reddit.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> and scientific<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Collapsology_Have_you_heard_about |title=Collapsology!

Among the works on this theme (in a broad sense) we can cite those of [[Berossus]] (278 B.C.), [[Pliny the Younger]] (79 AD), [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1375), [[Montesquieu]] (1734), [[Thomas Malthus|Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1766 - 1834), [[Edward Gibbon]] (1776), [[Georges Cuvier]], (1821), [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]] (1905), [[Oswald Spengler]] (1918), [[Arnold Toynbee]] (1939), [[G\u00fcnther Anders]] (1956), [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] (1956), [[Leopold Kohr]] (1957), [[Rachel Carson]] (1962), [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich (1969)]], [[Donella Meadows]], [[Dennis Meadows]] & [[J\u00f8rgen Randers]] (1972), [[Ren\u00e9 Dumont]] (1973), [[Hans Jonas]] (1979), [[Joseph Tainter]] (1988), [[Al Gore]] (1992), [[Hubert Reeves]] (2003), [[Richard Posner]] (2004), [[Jared Diamond]] (2005).\n\n==== Arnold J. Toynbee (1889-1975) ====\nIn his monumental (initially published in twelve volumes) and highly controversial work of contemporary historiography entitled \"[[A Study of History]]\" (1972), [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee|Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889-1975) deals with the genesis of civilizations (chap. 2), their growth (chap. 3), their decline (chap. 4), and their disintegration (chap. 5). According to him, the mortality of civilizations is trivial evidence for the historian, as is the fact that they follow one another over a long period of time.\n\n==== Joseph Tainter (born 1949) ====\nIn his book [[The Collapse of Complex Societies]], the anthropologist and historian [[Joseph Tainter]] (1949-) studies the collapse of various civilizations, including that of the Roman Empire, in terms of [[network theory]], [[energy economics|energy economics]] and [[Complex system|complexity theory]]. For Tainter, an increasingly complex society eventually collapses because of the ever-increasing difficulty in solving its problems.\n\n==== Jared Diamond (born 1937) ====\nThe american [[geographer]], [[synthetic theory of evolution|evolutionary]] [[biologist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Jared Diamond]] (1937- )  already evoked the theme of civilizational collapse in his book called ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', published in 2005. By relying on historical cases, notably the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] civilization, the [[Vikings]] and the [[Maya civilization]], Diamond argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues as these civilizations did, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations. This book has had a resonance beyond the United States, despite some criticism<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jarde|date=2005|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|isbn=978-0-241-95868-1|url=http://cpor.org/ce/Diamond%282005%29Collapse-HowSocietiesChooseFailureSuccess.pdf|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>.\n\n=== Modern collapsologists ===\nSince the invention of the term collapsology, many french personalities gravitate in or around the collapsologists' sphere. Not all have the same vision of civilizational collapse, some even reject the term \"collapsologist\", but all agree that contemporary industrial civilization, and the biosphere as a whole, are on the verge of a global crisis of unprecedented proportions. According to them, the process is already under way, and it is now only possible to try to reduce its devastating effects in the near future. The leaders of the movement are [[Yves Cochet]] and [[:fr:Agnes Sina\u00ef|Agnes Sina\u00ef]] of the [[:fr:Institut Momentum|Momentum Institute]] (a [[think tank]] exploring the causes of environmental and societal risks of collapse of the thermo-industrial civilization and possible actions to adapt to it), and Pablo Servigne and Rapha\u00ebl Stevens who wrote the essay ''How everything can collapse: A manual for our times''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Servigne |first=Pablo |last2=Stevens |first2=Rapha\u00ebl |title=How Everything Can Collapse|publisher=Polity|year=2020|isbn=9781509541393|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>).

Ramolula is credited with production on [[IFani|iFani's]] Club 808 chart topping single 'Milli'. Most recently, in a bid to showcase his versatility Ramolula has been working with a lot of artists from other genre's. This has spawned the radio excitable single 'Better With Silence'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.warnermusic.co.za/multi-platinum-electro-hop-duo-locnville-present-their-latest-single-better-with-silence/|title=Multi-Platinum electro-hop duo, Locnville present their latest single 'Better With Silence' {{!}} Warner Music South Africa|language=en-ZA|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref> which has Ramolula as a lead artist alongside [[Locnville]] with additional vocals by YoungstaCPT.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in  the judicial capital of South Africa, Ramolula's musical journey started to take shape when he was 16.

His skill was honed during university days where he used breaks between classes to master his craft and technical ability. During this period of his life Ramolula decided that, despite studying Agriculture at the Central University of Technology he would yield the farms for the love of music, a SlikourOnLife article<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slikouronlife.co.za/blog/4878/a-sit-down-with-producer-extraordinaire-airedeeglobal-with-mshelen_n|title=A Sit Down With Producer Extraordinaire @AiredeeGlobal With @MsHelen_N|website=www.slikouronlife.co.za|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref> on Ramolula states \"He doesn't miss the farm\", a sitdown interview in which the producer shares how he used to randomly send beats to Rappers until he got his break.

{"title_page": "Slavery during the American Civil War", "text_new": "{{for|a related subject|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\n[[File:Stephens-reading-proclamation-1863.jpeg|thumb|[[Henry Louis Stephens]], untitled watercolor ({{circa}} 1863) of a black man reading a newspaper with headline \"Presidential Proclamation/Slavery\".]]\n{{African American topics collapsible sidebar}}\n'''Slavery played pp poopoo the central role during the American Civil War'''. The [[Origins of the American Civil War|primary catalyst for secession]] was slavery, especially Southern political leaders' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces to block the expansion of slavery into the western [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Slave life went through great changes, as the South saw [[Union Army|Union Armies]] take control of broad areas of land. During and before the war, slaves played an active role in their own emancipation, and thousands of slaves escaped from bondage during the war. On January 1, 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], making 3 million blacks legally free. In the war, both sides used African Americans for military purposes; in the South as slave labor and in the north as wage labor and military volunteers. Over 100,000 ex-slaves fought for the Union and over 500,000 fled their plantations for Union lines. Religiosity and cultural expression also developed greatly during the war.\n\n==Demographics and economics==\n{{main|Slavery in the United States}}\n[[File:SlavePopulationUS1860.jpg|thumb|right|Percentage of slaves in each county of the slave states in 1860]]\nThere have been many different ways to estimate the amount of slaveholding in the south. One estimate is that in 1860, about 25% of households and 5% of the population (384,000 people) in the South owned at least one slave. An alternative estimate is that 36% of men lived in slaveholding families, and the percentage of men who had economic ties to slavery was much higher. In the [[Confederate Army]], about 10% of the enlisted men and about 50% of the officers were slaveholders.<ref>Woodward 2014, p12-13</ref> Virginia was the largest slave state, in white population, in black population, and in contribution to the Confederate Army. [[Richmond, Virginia]] was the Confederate capital and was a major industrial and commercial center. [[Virginia]] was also an engine of the domestic slave trade. Virginia plantations were smaller than average and there were more slaveholders per capita in Virginia than in the rest of the Confederacy.<ref>Woodward 2014, p15</ref> Large numbers of slaves lived in the states along the border between the Union and Confederacy. Approximately 500,000 slaves lived in [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Maryland]]; border slave states, which did not join the Confederacy.<ref>Woodward 2014, p16</ref>\n\nMost of the South's slaves were owned by planters (often defined as those who owned twenty of more slaves), although yeomen farmers outnumbered planters which numbered fewer than 50,000. Southern agriculture was more lucrative than northern, focusing on crops of rice, cotton, and sugar.<ref>Woodward 2014, p32-33</ref> Even before the war, in the rice regions of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] and in parts of the [[Mississippi Delta]] there were ten or even twenty slaves for every white person. During the war, this disparity grew, leading to fear of insurrection and calls for militia companies to be stationed in agricultural regions to guarantee peace.<ref>Woodward 2014, p46</ref>\n\n[[File:SlavesForSaleNewOrleans1861.jpeg|thumb|left|Slaves for sale, a scene in [[New Orleans]], 1861.]]\nThe market for buying and selling slaves continued during the war, as did the market for hiring and hiring out slave labor.<ref>Woodward 2014, p90</ref> Although the price of slaves grew, it did not keep up with inflation, causing the real price of slaves to decline during the civil war. The prices of slaves rose and fell in part with the prospects for Confederate victory.<ref>Martinez 2006</ref> In 1860, the average slave sold in Virginia brought $1,500 and a \"prime field hand\" in [[New Orleans]] brought $1,800. In 1863, slaves in Richmond sold for $4,000 or $5,000 and in [[Texas]] for $2,500 to $3,500 depending on skillsets.<ref>Woodward 2014, p96</ref> Before the start of the war, the expansion of slavery was an important political and economic goal for slaveholders. This continued during the war, and there was a large expansion of slavery into Texas, which had been made a state in 1845.<ref>Woodward 2014, p97-98</ref> However, late in the war, many slave-owners recognized the increasing probability that slavery would be ended and there is evidence of increased attempts to sell slaves.<ref>Woodward 2014, p100</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nOpportunities for cultural expression grew as autonomy for slaves increased during the war. Christianity grew among slaves and freedmen during and immediately after the civil war. Organizations such as the [[American Missionary Association]] and [[National Freedman's Relief Association]] sent missionaries into Union occupied areas where they formed religious congregations and led revivals.<ref>Fountain 2010, p99</ref> The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME) in particular established a large presence among slaves and freedmen in and around Union held areas. Along with civilian missionaries, the AME also provided chaplains for black Union regiments. Among the free blacks AME figures especially active in the South during the war were [[James Walker Hood]],<ref>Simmons 1887, p133-143</ref> [[Henry McNeal Turner]],<ref>Simmons 1887, p336-339</ref> [[Jabez Pitt Campbell]],<ref>Simmons 1887, p1032</ref> [[John M. Brown]] and [[William E. Matthews]].<ref>Simmons 1887, p1113-1118</ref>\n\n[[Music of the American Civil War|Music]] sung by African-Americans changed during the war. The theme of escape from bondage became especially important in spirituals sung by blacks, both by slaves singing among themselves on plantations and for free and recently freed blacks singing to white audiences. New versions of songs such as \"Hail Mary\", \"[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]\", and \"[[Go Down Moses]]\" emphasized the message of freedom and the rejection of slavery.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p149-150, p157</ref> Many new slave songs were sung as well, the most popular being, \"[[Many Thousands Gone|Many Thousands Go]]\", which was frequently sung by slaves fleeing plantations to Union Army camps.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p151</ref> Several attempts were made to publish slave songs during the war. The first was the publishing of sheet music to \"Go Down Moses\" by Reverend L. C. Lockwood in December 1861 based on his experience with escaped slaves in [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]] in September of that year. In 1863, the ''Continental Monthly'' published a sampling of spirituals from [[South Carolina]] in an article titled, \"Under the Palmetto.\"<ref>McWhirter 2012, p155-156</ref>\n\nThe white Colonel of the all-black [[First South Carolina Colored Volunteers|First South Carolina]], [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] noted that when blacks knew that whites were listening, they changed the way they were sung, and historian Christian McWhirter noted that African Americans \"used their music to reshape white perceptions and foster a new image of black culture as thriving and ready for freedom.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p152</ref> In [[Port Royal Experiment|Port Royal]], escaped slaves learned the anthem, \"America\" in secret, never singing it in front of whites. When the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was passed a celebration was held, and in a surprise to white onlookers, contrabands began singing the anthem, using the song to express their new status.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p158-159</ref> The most popular white songs among slaves were \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" and H. C.

Several Confederate regimental bands included slaves, and Confederates arranged slaves to sing and dance to show how happy they were. Slave performer [[Blind Tom Wiggins|Thomas Greene Bethune]], known as Blind Tom frequently played pro-Confederate songs such as \"Maryland, My Maryland\" and \"Dixie\" during this period and dropped, \"Yankee Doodle\" from his performances.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p154</ref>\n\n==Disaffection==\nSlave uprisings were a constant fear of slaveholders before and during the war. A slave insurrection was planned in [[Adams County, Mississippi]], which was uncovered in the summer of 1861 leading to widespread punishment of slaves in the area.<ref>Woodward 2014, p17-18</ref> In June 1861, an aborted insurrection occurred in [[St. Martin's Parish, Louisiana]], which resulted in the arrest of forty slaves and the arrest of two white men who led the uprising, one of whom was arrested and the other who escaped. In August 1861, a possible uprising in [[Jefferson County, Alabama]] involving possibly 400 slaves was put down. Slaveholders in mountainous country particular feared uprising as the terrain made slaves more difficult to monitor.<ref>Woodward 2014, p17-18</ref>\n\n[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|right|Peter or [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], a whipped slave, photo taken at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], 1863; the guilty overseer was fired.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kathleen|last=Collins|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Letters-t-ASLAVENAMEDG_LETTERS.html?_r=0|title=The Scourged Back|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=History of Photography|date=January 9, 1985|pages=43\u201345}}</ref>]]\nPhysical punishment had a prominent place in slave society and this extended to slaves in the Confederate Army, who were frequently whipped or punished in other ways. Slaves were occasionally rewarded for good behavior, but there was a belief that punishment was a more effective means of maintaining control. Punishments sometimes extended to include maiming, murder, rape, and the selling of loved ones, the last of these being often considered one of the most severe punishments.<ref>Woodward 2014, p92-94</ref>\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Harriet Tubman Civil War Woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|A woodcut of [[Harriet Tubman]] in her [[American Civil War|Civil War]] clothing]]\nSlave resistance was widespread during and before the Civil War. One important outcome of that resistance was the effect it had on Southern troop morale as it undermined the belief that black people were more loyal to the Confederacy than the Union.<ref>Woodward 2014, p105</ref> Generally, African Americans cheered for Union victory and the Confederacy made a great effort to keep slaves under their control.<ref>Woodward 2014, p91</ref> After the war, Confederate veterans downplayed this resistance and professed to believe most slaves were loyal at heart.<ref>Woodward 2014, p105</ref> In reality, slave resistance was common and widespread. On farms and plantations, slaves broke equipment, feigned illness, slowed or stopped work, stole, plotted revolts, and fled.<ref>Woodward 2014, p107</ref> White's and blacks mobilized to help escaping slaves, following what was known as the [[Underground Railroad]], and cementing the fame of individuals such as [[Harriet Tubman]].<ref>Clinton 2004</ref> Slave-owners were greatly disconcerted by the desire of their slaves to flee to Union armies, many genuinely believed slaves were tied by deep feelings and blamed abolitionist propaganda and the ignorance of slaves of the costs of freedom for their desire for freedom.<ref>Boles 2015, p185</ref> Slaves also recognized that freedom by the sword may not be permanent and preferred to bide their time until an opportunity for freedom was assured, while others feared the uncertainty of a change in their current situation. However, most slaves chose freedom when the opportunity allowed. Where possible, many slave owners fled advancing Union armies and brought their slaves with them. In situations such as along the Atlantic coast and Mississippi river where Union advance was very fast and such arrangements were not made, fleeing slave owners left their slaves behind and many slaves escaped to the Union. Fleeing slave-owners from [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] often moved to Texas and the roads to Texas were said to be crowded with blacks.<ref>Boles 2015, p184</ref>\n\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Eastman Johnson]] (American, 1824\u20131906). ''A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves (recto)'', ca. 1862. Oil on paperboard. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nEstimates of the number of runaways during the war vary. Secretary of War [[William Seward]] estimated that the Union Army seized about 200,000 slaves, while historians of estimated figures from 500,000 to 1,000,000.<ref>Woodward 2014, p107</ref> Slaves often disguised their feelings from their masters, wishing to appear loyal but watching and waiting for a chance to at freedom. Some slaves were willing to risk their lives and families, while others were not. Many and perhaps most slaves were governable during the war, especially in the early years.<ref>Woodward 2014, p107-108</ref> Escaping slaves who were caught on their way to freedom were usually very harshly dealt with and frequently executed.<ref>Woodward 2014, p120</ref>\n\nConfederates emphasized negative aspects of the transition from slavery to freedom in discussions with their slaves and in letters and conversations during the period. Letters from captured Confederate soldiers noted the poor housing conditions and dress of freedmen they saw in Union held cities. Indeed, disease and lack of medical care were major issues in Federal camps set up for the freedmen, and some former slaves were sent to local planters where conditions were better. In Federal hands, there were cases of rape and other brutalities, and there were social and labor issues among the freedpeople. For instance, looking for work, in some cases, female slaves turned to prostitution.<ref>Woodward 2014, p119-120</ref>\n\nIn spite of evidences of the desire of slaves to be free, the \"loyal slave\" fixed itself in the consciousness of many white southerners during and after the war. This image had some grounding in fact, and examples of personal bond, sense of duty, or other calculations leading slaves to remain loyal exist. There are also examples of slaves who served masters serving in the Confederate Army, protecting women and children from assault by federal troops, or assisting aging or wounded masters when escape was possible.<ref>Boles 2015, p183</ref>\n\n==Slaves in the Confederate service==\n{{see also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\nThe Confederacy's early military successes depended significantly on slavery. Slaves provided agricultural and industrial labor, constructed fortifications, repaired railroads, and freed up white men to serve as soldiers.<ref>Smith 2013, p9-10</ref>  Tens of thousands of slaves were used to build and repair fortifications and railroads, as haulers, teamsters, ditch diggers, and assisting medical workers.<ref>Woodward 2014, p56</ref> In their role, slaves in the army were heavily relied on and in some cases overworked to the point of illness or death.<ref>Woodward 2014, p58, 66-67</ref>\n\n[[File:Sergeant A.M. Chandler of the 44th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, Co. F., and Silas Chandler, family slave, with Bowie knives, revolvers, pepper-box, shotgun, and canteen.jpg|thumb|Sergeant A.M. Chandler of the 44th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, Co. F., and [[Silas Chandler]], family slave]]\nAnother role slaves played during the war was camp servants. This role was more common in large, encamped armies than among home guard or guerilla units. Camp servants served their master and not the government and served officers and enlisted soldiers. Most Confederates could not, of course, afford this luxury, but they were not rare.<ref>Woodward 2014, p81-82</ref> In cases where camp servants were not enslaved, servants could receive a significant salary. It was also not uncommon for slaves to be paid or to keep a portion of the earnings derived from their labor. In one case, a soldier reported a slave receiving $4 for a week's washing and cooking, and in another servant, labor was reported to receive payments in excess of a private's pre-1864 monthly pay of $11.<ref>Woodward 2014, p83-84</ref>\n\nConfederates frequently wrote about the care slaves had for their dying or deceased masters. This care represented the benign relationship between slaves and masters in the minds of Confederates. Historians have questioned whether the care taken represented affection or was due to anxiety about the fate of the slaves themselves after the death of their masters.<ref>Woodward 2014, p90-91</ref> On the other hand, physical punishment had a prominent place in slave society and this extended to slaves in the Confederate Army, who were frequently whipped or punished in other ways. Slaves were occasionally rewarded for good behavior, but there was a belief that punishment was a more effective means of maintaining control. Punishments sometimes extended to include maiming, murder, rape, and the selling of loved ones, the last of these being often considered the most severe punishment.<ref>Woodward 2014, p92-94</ref>\n\nThe role of slavery on the size of the Confederate Army was complicated. While the use of slave labor in camps freed white soldiers to fight, the population was said to be more willing to send their white men to the army than risk the life and labor of their slaves.<ref>Woodward 2014, p56</ref> In October 1862, the Confederacy passed a draft bill known as the \"[[Twenty Slave Law]]\" that allowed one white male to stay behind on plantations with twenty or more slaves, which was meant to protect property on large plantations but also alienated many non-slaveholders in the south.<ref>Woodward 2014, p47-48</ref>\n\n===Impressment===\nThe Confederate Congress passed a slave impressment law on March 26, 1863. This law raised questions about whether or not the Confederacy could seize free blacks, who numbered about 260,000 in the South in 1860. The Virginia legislature dealt with this issue by subjecting free blacks to the Confederate draft to serve in non-combat roles and limiting the number of slaves the government could impress. In this way, commanders in Virginia had the power to force free and enslaved blacks into service. However, a limited number of free blacks were actually impressed. In part, this is because the proportion of free blacks who were males of military age was relatively small and many of those were already working in military-related tasks.<ref>Woodward 2014, p64-65</ref>\nFor much of the war, Confederate soldiers were relatively comfortable and well supplied. However, by the spring of 1864, the situation tightened. On March 4, 1864, Confederate General Order No 28 said that officers and enlisted men would receive one ration per day, giving no consideration for body servants. A number of commanders protested and a letter was sent to the government on March 19 signed by officers including Generals [[Richard Ewell]], [[Jubal Early]], [[Stephen Dodson Ramseur|Stephen Ramseur]], and [[John Brown Gordon|John Gordon]] requesting an increase in rations to account for servants.<ref>Woodward 2014, p86-87</ref>\n\nSlave labor was not free of the perils of war, and Confederates occasionally wrote about slave laborers facing enemy shelling.<ref>Woodward 2014, p66</ref> While slave-owners expected compensation when slaves died in the service of the Confederate Army, most Confederates did not own slaves and preferred a dead black worker than a dead white one. Thus, the hazardous conditions of slave labor may have been in part premeditated<ref>Woodward 2014, p58, 66-67</ref>\n\nIn some cases, a plantation's slaves were asked for volunteer to join the army, and some were excited for the change in tasks.<ref>Woodward 2014, p58</ref> However, the Confederacy had more need for laborers than was filled by slaves. In part, this was exacerbated by the refusal of white Confederate soldiers to join in the necessary labor in many cases.<ref>Woodward 2014, p59</ref> The Confederate government set up impressment bureaus to ensure slaveholders furnished enough slaves. In Texas in June 1863, district commander [[John B. Magruder|John Magruder]] was put in charge of one such bureau, and Magruder was known for his ability to usually succeed in appeals to slaveholder patriotism to acquire slaves rather than impressment.<ref>Woodward 2014, p70-71</ref> In the West, General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] led numerous cavalry raids where he captured many slaves who had fled behind Union lines, often sending excess to other commands.<ref>Woodward 2014, p77</ref> Confederate forces also made raids on Union controlled plantations in the south, particularly along the Mississippi river.<ref>Woodward 2014, p120</ref> When Confederate forces marched North, such as during the [[Gettysburg campaign]] under [[Robert E. Lee]], Confederates in [[Pennsylvania]] rounded up as many blacks as possible, whether they were free before the war or not. These individuals became part of the spoils of war.<ref>Woodward 2014, p121</ref> Northerners asked camp servants in the Confederate Army marching in the north why they did not flee to freedom. It would have been difficult for them to escape during the campaign, however. Fleeing to the north may not have seemed like an appealing option as, in some cases, northerners expressed their racism and dislike for blacks in the presence of Confederate soldiers and servants.<ref>Woodward 2014, p121</ref>\n\nEven before the government authorized the impressment of slaves, officers forced thousands of slaves to work, and the scale of slave projects during the war was greater than those present on plantations, where only one master's slaves worked. Slaves built fortifications at Richmond, [[Fort Henry, Tennessee|Fort Henry]], [[Fort Donelson]], [[Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]], [[Wilmington, North Carolina in the American Civil War|Wilmington]], and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. In September 1862, Confederate General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] was in charge of coastal defenses in South Carolina and Georgia and had 1,400 slaves working on the fortifications at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. In May 1862, 7,500 slaves were said to be working at Mobile. In the spring of 1863, between 4,000 and 6,000 slaves were said to be working on the railways running into Richmond.<ref>Woodward 2014, p58</ref> In November 1862, Robert E. Lee was in charge of defenses of the [[North Carolina]], South Carolina, and Georgia coasts and had 3,330 slaves working in the fortifications at Wilmington.<ref>Woodward 2014, p63</ref> Slave labor on fortifications ultimately undermined slavery, as it served as justification for the Confiscation acts and ultimately the 13th Amendment discussed below.<ref>Martinez 2013, p17</ref>\n\nNear the war's end, slaves were in high demand to fortify the last bastions of the Confederacy. In the defense of [[Atlanta]], General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] called for 12,000 slaves to join his army as teamsters and cooks, but such a large number was never furnished for any general, although slaves were an important part of the campaign, building fallback lines for the stubbornly retreating Confederate army to man. At Richmond, Lee received 2,000 or his requested 5,000 to relieve white teamsters for duty in the lines.<ref>Woodward 2014, p75-76</ref>\n\nNear the end of the war, the Confederacy made efforts to enlist black soldiers. In November 1864, Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] called on the Confederate Congress to purchase 40,000 slaves who would then be emancipated in return for military service. Such calls were very contentious in the south, with General [[Patrick Cleburne]] being a leading proponent of arming slaves. Among the opposition to the idea, General [[Howell Cobb]] argued in January 1865, \"If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" As the Confederacy collapsed in early 1864 and 1865, arming slaves became, in the words of General Robert E. Lee, \"not only expedient but necessary.\" In March 1865, Davis authorized the enlistment of blacks to the Confederate army and companies began to form by March 25. However, Confederate forces in Virginia surrendered on April 3 and the war was over on April 9, 1865, before black soldiers had a chance to fight on the Confederate side.<ref>Boles 2015, p197-198</ref>\n\n==Contraband==\n[[File:Gunboat Planter.png|thumb|The gunboat [[USS Planter (1862)|USS ''Planter'']], stolen and run out of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] by escaping slave and future Congressman, [[Robert Smalls]], in May 1862]]\nAt the outset of the war, Abraham Lincoln hoped to keep the Union intact with or without slavery.<ref>Smith 2013, p9</ref> Early in the war, there was belief that the conflict would be chivalric in character and northern Generals hesitated to aid escaping slaves. but by 1862, the bitterness of the conflict became clear and Federals began to seize slaves in ernest.<ref>Woodward 2014, p110</ref> As early as May 1861, Union General [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in command at [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]], unilaterally refused to return escaped slaves who reached Federal lines to their slave-owners. Instead, Butler employed them in the quartermaster department, reasoning that returning the slaves would aid the enemy, and the [[Grand Contraband Camp, Virginia]] was formed. Lincoln allowed Butler's policy to stand, and on August 6, 1861, Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862|First Confiscation Act]] which allowed the government to seize all property used by the Confederacy, including slaves. However, Union commanders were officially instructed to exclude runaway slaves until July 1862, when Lincoln admitted the importance of allowing slaves to escape to Union lines was a military necessity.<ref>Smith 2013, p10-11</ref> The escaped slaves came to be known as \"contrabands\" and over two hundred thousand such individuals came to work for the Union Army. Initially, contrabands worked as teamsters, blacksmiths, cooks, coopers, carpenters, bakers, butchers, laundresses, personal servants, and performed other menial duties. Over the course of the war, many contraband took on more formal employment in support of the Union Army, particularly as cattle drivers, stevedores, and pioneer laborers.<ref>Smith 2013, p11</ref> Lincoln feared the 1861 Confiscation Act would drive Border States into the Confederacy and was opposed by efforts of Union General [[John C. Fremont]] and of Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] to push forward emancipation and enlistment of black soldiers respectively.<ref>Smith 2013, p11-12</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some Union Army Generals kept a practice of returning escaped slaves to their masters, particularly democrats such as Generals [[Henry Halleck]], [[George B. McClellan]], and [[Don Carlos Buell]]. Halleck's General Order No. 3 barred fugitive slaves from his lines.<ref>Woodward 2014, p108-109</ref>\n\nHowever, slaves strongly desired to be free and to contribute to their own emancipation.<ref>Smith 2013, p10</ref> Blacks were fundamental in engendering anti-slavery and emancipation sentiment in the north. Union soldiers saw the scars on the bodies of slaves they encountered marching in the south and saw the relative squalor in which they lived. They heard the stories of slaves and saw their willingness to fight for their own freedom and join the Union Army.<ref>Manning 2007, p77</ref>\n\nThis willingness to fight was irresistible to Union Generals in need of manpower. Since 1792, Federal law prohibited black men from serving in the state militias and the U.S. Army, but that changed during the war.<ref>Smith 2013, p9</ref> In May 1862, General [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|James H. Lane]] in Kansas and [[John W. Phelps]] in Louisiana began to enlist black men into regiments without War Department authorization. Lane's efforts resulted in the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored)|First Kansas Colored Volunteers]] while Phelps was opposed by his superior, General Butler, who, desperate for reinforcements, relented in August 1862 resulting in the [[Louisiana Native Guards]], which was made up largely of freemen.<ref>Smith 2013, p13-14</ref> Also in May 1862, General [[David Hunter]] proclaimed martial law and ordered slaves freed in the area around his command at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast, a command which included sections of coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. On May 19, Lincoln annulled Hunter's emancipation decree, but remained silent on aspects of Hunter's proclamation involving the enlistment of slaves.<ref>Smith 2013, p13-14</ref> Among the few black officers in these early regiments were freemen [[William D. Matthews]] and [[Caesar Antoine]].\n\nIn September 1862, Stanton authorized General [[Rufus Saxton]], who had taken Hunter's position in command of parts of coastal South Carolina, to arm blacks to help guard coastal plantations, leading to the [[First South Carolina Colored Volunteers]] in 1862 and the establishment of colonies at places like [[Edisto Island during the American Civil War|Edisto Island]] and [[Port Royal Experiment|Port Royal]].<ref>Smith 2013, p15-16</ref> Hunter's recruitment of blacks was debated in Congress, with [[Charles A. Wickliffe]] and [[Robert Mallory]] of Kentucky opposing the efforts and [[Thaddeus Stevens]] leading the support. Lincoln's quiet official policies in favor of emancipation and enlistment of slaves and loud repudiation of Hunter and Fremont led to criticism by many abolitionists such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]].<ref>Smith 2013, p16</ref>\n\n==Emancipation==\n{{main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\nExecutive and legislative efforts to end slavery started early in the war. In November 1861, Lincoln proposed a plan of compensated emancipation for slaves in the state of Delaware, a proposal which was rejected by the [[Delaware]] legislature. Lincoln proposed compensated emancipation programs again in early 1862 estimating that such a policy for Border States would be less expensive than continued war. The appeal was again rejected in March 1862. A third attempt was made on July 12, 1862 when representatives of Border States rejected a compensated emancipation plan proposed by Lincoln.<ref>Smith 2013, p17-19</ref> In March 1862, Congress enacted an Article of War circumventing much of the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]] of 1793 and 1850, and in April Congress abolished slavery in Washington D. C. compensating slaveholders and offering money to assist in immigration of slaves to [[Haiti]] or [[Liberia]]. In June, Congress emancipated slaves in [[United States territories|Federal territories]] without compensation, overturning the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision of 1857.<ref>Smith 2013, p18</ref>\n\nAfter the repeated rejection of compensated emancipation plans, Lincoln began to contemplate a presidential emancipation decree in mid-1862. On July 17, 1862, Congress passed the [[Militia Act of 1862|Militia Act]] which emancipated Confederate bondsmen employed by the Union army and authorized the president to receive into service blacks for \"any military or naval service for which they may be found competent\", authorizing the enlistment of blacks although intended to only apply to slaves of disloyal slave-owners and not to free blacks or slaves of loyal border state slave-owners. That same day, congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862|Second Confiscation Act]], which authorized the emancipation of slaves of people engaged in rebellion.<ref>Smith 2013, p19-20</ref> Lincoln was slow to enact the provisions of the Second Confiscation Act, which was criticized by abolitionists, particularly Frederick Douglass.<ref>Smith 2013, p20</ref>\n\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\nOn July 21, 1862, four days after signing the Militia and Second Confiscation Acts, Lincoln met with his cabinet to inform them that he intended to implement the military and emancipation provisions of the acts, but not the colonization, and the next day he shared with the cabinet the preliminary emancipation proclamation. His proposal would extend to slaves beyond those under Federal Control and would be made as a war measure, which could circumvent the courts and legislature. In order to avoid alienating Border States, particularly Kentucky, Lincoln chose not to unveil his new position until the New Year.<ref>Smith 2013, p22-23</ref> In part, this decision to delay stemmed from a desire to wait to make the proclamation until the Union Army had made some advances to ensure that the proclamation did not to appear to be made out of desperation. McClellan's victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in late summer 1862 gave Lincoln political capital, which was important in allowing Lincoln to issue his emancipation proclamation.<ref>Boles 2015, p190-191</ref> Abolitionists such as [[Frederick Douglass]] greatly approved Lincoln's new position, writing, \"The white man is liberated, the black man is liberated, the brave men now fighting in the battles of their country against rebels and traitors are now liberated...\"<ref>Smith 2013, p25</ref>\n\nThe proclamation did receive some criticism, particularly from the South. It also only freed slaves in Confederate controlled areas, exempting about 800,000 of the country's 2.9 million slaves. In addition, it depended on Union gains in the war for its enforcement.<ref>Smith 2013, p26</ref> Among opponents were General [[William T. Sherman]], who frequently complained about emancipation and enlistment but who complied with the edicts.<ref>Smith 2013, p31</ref>\n\n[[File:Timothy H. O'Sullivan (American - Slaves, J. J. Smith's Plantation, South Carolina - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Freed slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation on the Sea Islands near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan|Timothy O'Sullivan]] standing before their quarters in 1862]]\nThroughout the war, slaves were emancipating themselves. The two major events which allowed slaves to choose freedom were the increased possibility of escaping as white men who otherwise controlled slaves leaving the plantations for the Confederate Army and the advance of Union troops into close proximity. To prevent the former, attempts were made to better organize slave patrol and use the militia for such control, but these were less effective because the slave owners especially experienced in keeping their own slaves in bondage were often away in the Army.<ref>Boles 2015, p186</ref> The advance of the Union Army had large effect on slavery in the areas they came to control. The first region the Union Army captured was the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. Confederates reported that after their masters fled, the slaves in those areas pillaged their masters' property. The Union also made gains in western [[Kentucky]], western [[Tennessee]], and northern Mississippi.<ref>Woodward 2014, p110</ref>\n\nOccupying Union forces made a number of efforts to provide for freed slaves. In Tennessee, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed [[John Eaton, Jr.]] to be in charge of fugitives, and a camp was established at [[Grand Junction, Tennessee]], later moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], which organized these efforts. The camp provided shelter, food, and a small amount of medical attention. It also centralized the hiring of freedmen to whites who leased abandoned plantations; transforming agriculture in Union held areas from a slave to a wage based labor system. This same system had already been implemented in 1862 along the South Carolina coast in the Port Royal experiment. Efforts were not universally successful, as tension developed between goals of efficiency and of black autonomy. In several locations, including Jefferson Davis' properties at [[Davis Bend, Mississippi]], freed blacks were allotted land and given direct control. In spite of these examples, most freed slaves shifted to wage laborers, which were more similar to sharecropping than real freedom. This failure of provision of a solid economic footing for freed slaves has been considered a cause of the failure of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref>Boles 2015, p191-192</ref>\n\n===Colored Troops===\n{{main|United States Colored Troops}}\n{{see also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\n[[Image:Company I of the 36th Colored Regiment.jpg|thumb|right|A company of 4th [[United States Colored Troops]] (USCT). USCT regiments formed up to a tenth of the [[Union army]].]]\nAfter the Emancipation Proclamation, black soldiers became commonplace and eventually numbered 178,895 with 133,000 coming from slave states and mostly consisting of former slaves. Northerners were initially uncomfortable arming blacks and black troops were usually placed under white officers. They were also given inferior equipment and medical care and assigned disproportionate amounts of heavy labor. However, the success of these regiments led to a change in prospective. The Confederate government and army were infuriated with the northern use of black soldiers, seeing such troops as slave insurrectionaries and subjecting captured black soldiers to re-enslavement or death for treason.<ref>Boles 2015, p193-194</ref> In December 1862, Jefferson Davis issued what has been called the \"Anti-Emancipation Proclamation\" which declared that the Confederate Army would return to slavery any black man found in Federal Uniform and turn over to the states any slaves found aiding Northern units; and would do the same with white officers of black regiments.<ref>Woodward 2014, p134</ref> This led to Lincoln threatening to kill a captured rebel soldier for every black Union soldier killed in captivity, and that every captured black soldier committed to slavery would be responded to by giving a Confederate captive hard labor. No official retaliations of this sort occurred.<ref>Boles 2015, p193-194</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Storming of Ft Wagner-lithograph by Kurz and Allison 1890.jpg|thumb|A lithograph of the storming of [[Fort Wagner]].]]\nBlack troops were not considered equal, neither by Federals or Confederates. Black soldiers were often exposed to more difficult conditions and had worse medical care. The mortality rate for black soldiers was about 40% higher than that for white troops, and over 38,000 black soldiers died from all causes.<ref>Boles 2015, p195</ref> On the battlefield, Black soldiers performed well, earning the respect of Union and Confederate Troops alike. However, Confederate victories against black soldiers led to atrocities where surrendering black Union soldiers were executed by Confederates. Two of the most notable such occurrences were in 1864 in the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]] in Tennessee and the [[Battle of the Crater]] in Virginia. Evidence is mixed over whether or not there was an official no-quarter policy, but at these victories, black soldiers were killed at a greatly disproportionate ratio.<ref>Woodward 2014, p148-150</ref>\n\n==Attitudes of whites==\nFeelings of whites about slavery during this period has also been the subject of study. Generally, poor, non-slaveholding whites in the south admired planters and sought to own slaves themselves.<ref>Woodward 2014, p52</ref> During the war, Confederate soldiers were optimistic about the prospects for the survival of the Confederacy and the institution of slavery well into 1864.<ref>Woodward 2014, p74</ref> Confederates feared the Emancipation Proclamation would lead to slave uprisings, an occurrence which even northerners did not desire. Although most people at that time had not been born at the time of the Nat Turner Revolt or the revolution in Haiti, but insurrections were greatly feared.<ref>Woodward 2014, p113-114</ref> Also, the north was not united against slavery, and many Union troops desired that the United States, win or lose, be a white man's country. However, it was clear to all that Lincoln's party, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was in favor of eventual if not immediate emancipation.<ref>Woodward 2014, p114-115</ref>\n\nWhile most historians agree that the war erupted over a debate about slavery, the role of slavery in the motivation of soldiers had been the subject of widespread debate. J. Tracy Power in ''Lee's Miserables'' and Stephen Berry in ''All That Makes a Man'' argued that Confederate soldiers did not think much about slavery. Others such as Chandra Manning in ''What This Cruel War Was Over'', Jason Phillips in ''Diehard Rebels'', Joseph Glatthaar in The ''New Civil War History'' and ''General Lee's Army'', Aaron Sheehan-Deen in ''Why Confederates Fought'', Kenneth Noe in ''Reluctant Rebels'', and James McPherson in ''For Cause and Comrades'' argued that slavery was central in the mindset of many Confederate soldiers. The issue in the mind and motivation of Union soldiers has also been debated. Manning's ''What This Cruel War Was Over'' is an example discussing the importance of slavery for Union soldiers.<ref>Woodward 2014, p4-7</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{main|Reconstruction Era}}\nAt the beginning of 1865, millions of black people remained as slaves, but the institution was crumbling. As the Confederate Army weakened, the Confederacy's ability to assert racial control lessened and large numbers of slaves were escaping to federal lines every day. Even as the large Armies surrendered, some Confederates held on to hope for victory and for the reassertion of slavery throughout the South.<ref>Woodward 2014, p181-183</ref> At the wars end, some Southern whites fled to South America where they could escape Federal law, and in some cases, continue slaveholding, although such cases were the exception.<ref>Woodward 2014, p185</ref>\n\nSlaves saw emancipation as more than an end to slavery, but also education, voting rights, and rights before the law.<ref>Manning 2007, p158</ref> The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] passed in January 1865 ending slavery in the Union and ensuring that under US control, slaves in the south would be freed.<ref>Woodward 2014, p180</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, a narrative of faithful slaves arose in the south, with stories of slaves marching with their masters or celebrating the return of soldiers to the plantations. Blacks living in the south were no longer slaves, but most remained and worked for their former masters. Even so, racial tensions grew greatly during the Reconstruction era.<ref>Woodward 2014, p187</ref> White supremacy grew as well, represented by the growth of the militancy of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the growth of belief in the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]] movement.<ref>Woodward 2014, p192</ref> The KKK was a radical supremacist group that persecuted African Americans and African American supporters.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Boles, John B.

The [[Origins of the American Civil War|primary catalyst for secession]] was slavery, especially Southern political leaders' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces to block the expansion of slavery into the western [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Slave life went through great changes, as the South saw [[Union Army|Union Armies]] take control of broad areas of land. During and before the war, slaves played an active role in their own emancipation, and thousands of slaves escaped from bondage during the war. On January 1, 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], making 3 million blacks legally free. In the war, both sides used African Americans for military purposes; in the South as slave labor and in the north as wage labor and military volunteers. Over 100,000 ex-slaves fought for the Union and over 500,000 fled their plantations for Union lines. Religiosity and cultural expression also developed greatly during the war.\n\n==Demographics and economics==\n{{main|Slavery in the United States}}\n[[File:SlavePopulationUS1860.jpg|thumb|right|Percentage of slaves in each county of the slave states in 1860]]\nThere have been many different ways to estimate the amount of slaveholding in the south. One estimate is that in 1860, about 25% of households and 5% of the population (384,000 people) in the South owned at least one slave. An alternative estimate is that 36% of men lived in slaveholding families, and the percentage of men who had economic ties to slavery was much higher. In the [[Confederate Army]], about 10% of the enlisted men and about 50% of the officers were slaveholders.<ref>Woodward 2014, p12-13</ref> Virginia was the largest slave state, in white population, in black population, and in contribution to the Confederate Army. [[Richmond, Virginia]] was the Confederate capital and was a major industrial and commercial center. [[Virginia]] was also an engine of the domestic slave trade. Virginia plantations were smaller than average and there were more slaveholders per capita in Virginia than in the rest of the Confederacy.<ref>Woodward 2014, p15</ref> Large numbers of slaves lived in the states along the border between the Union and Confederacy. Approximately 500,000 slaves lived in [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Maryland]]; border slave states, which did not join the Confederacy.<ref>Woodward 2014, p16</ref>\n\nMost of the South's slaves were owned by planters (often defined as those who owned twenty of more slaves), although yeomen farmers outnumbered planters which numbered fewer than 50,000. Southern agriculture was more lucrative than northern, focusing on crops of rice, cotton, and sugar.<ref>Woodward 2014, p32-33</ref> Even before the war, in the rice regions of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] and in parts of the [[Mississippi Delta]] there were ten or even twenty slaves for every white person. During the war, this disparity grew, leading to fear of insurrection and calls for militia companies to be stationed in agricultural regions to guarantee peace.<ref>Woodward 2014, p46</ref>\n\n[[File:SlavesForSaleNewOrleans1861.jpeg|thumb|left|Slaves for sale, a scene in [[New Orleans]], 1861.]]\nThe market for buying and selling slaves continued during the war, as did the market for hiring and hiring out slave labor.<ref>Woodward 2014, p90</ref> Although the price of slaves grew, it did not keep up with inflation, causing the real price of slaves to decline during the civil war. The prices of slaves rose and fell in part with the prospects for Confederate victory.<ref>Martinez 2006</ref> In 1860, the average slave sold in Virginia brought $1,500 and a \"prime field hand\" in [[New Orleans]] brought $1,800. In 1863, slaves in Richmond sold for $4,000 or $5,000 and in [[Texas]] for $2,500 to $3,500 depending on skillsets.<ref>Woodward 2014, p96</ref> Before the start of the war, the expansion of slavery was an important political and economic goal for slaveholders. This continued during the war, and there was a large expansion of slavery into Texas, which had been made a state in 1845.<ref>Woodward 2014, p97-98</ref> However, late in the war, many slave-owners recognized the increasing probability that slavery would be ended and there is evidence of increased attempts to sell slaves.<ref>Woodward 2014, p100</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nOpportunities for cultural expression grew as autonomy for slaves increased during the war. Christianity grew among slaves and freedmen during and immediately after the civil war. Organizations such as the [[American Missionary Association]] and [[National Freedman's Relief Association]] sent missionaries into Union occupied areas where they formed religious congregations and led revivals.<ref>Fountain 2010, p99</ref> The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (AME) in particular established a large presence among slaves and freedmen in and around Union held areas. Along with civilian missionaries, the AME also provided chaplains for black Union regiments. Among the free blacks AME figures especially active in the South during the war were [[James Walker Hood]],<ref>Simmons 1887, p133-143</ref> [[Henry McNeal Turner]],<ref>Simmons 1887, p336-339</ref> [[Jabez Pitt Campbell]],<ref>Simmons 1887, p1032</ref> [[John M. Brown]] and [[William E. Matthews]].<ref>Simmons 1887, p1113-1118</ref>\n\n[[Music of the American Civil War|Music]] sung by African-Americans changed during the war. The theme of escape from bondage became especially important in spirituals sung by blacks, both by slaves singing among themselves on plantations and for free and recently freed blacks singing to white audiences. New versions of songs such as \"Hail Mary\", \"[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]\", and \"[[Go Down Moses]]\" emphasized the message of freedom and the rejection of slavery.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p149-150, p157</ref> Many new slave songs were sung as well, the most popular being, \"[[Many Thousands Gone|Many Thousands Go]]\", which was frequently sung by slaves fleeing plantations to Union Army camps.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p151</ref> Several attempts were made to publish slave songs during the war. The first was the publishing of sheet music to \"Go Down Moses\" by Reverend L. C. Lockwood in December 1861 based on his experience with escaped slaves in [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]] in September of that year. In 1863, the ''Continental Monthly'' published a sampling of spirituals from [[South Carolina]] in an article titled, \"Under the Palmetto.\"<ref>McWhirter 2012, p155-156</ref>\n\nThe white Colonel of the all-black [[First South Carolina Colored Volunteers|First South Carolina]], [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] noted that when blacks knew that whites were listening, they changed the way they were sung, and historian Christian McWhirter noted that African Americans \"used their music to reshape white perceptions and foster a new image of black culture as thriving and ready for freedom.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p152</ref> In [[Port Royal Experiment|Port Royal]], escaped slaves learned the anthem, \"America\" in secret, never singing it in front of whites. When the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was passed a celebration was held, and in a surprise to white onlookers, contrabands began singing the anthem, using the song to express their new status.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p158-159</ref> The most popular white songs among slaves were \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" and H. C. Work's \"Kingdom Coming\",<ref>McWhirter 2012, p159</ref> and as the war continued, the lyrics African Americans sung changed, with vagueness and coded language dropped and including open expressions of their new roles as soldiers and citizens.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p163</ref>\n\nSlave owners in the south responded by restricting singing on plantations and imprisoning singers of songs supporting emancipation or the North.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p152-153</ref> Confederate supporters also looked to music sung by slaves for signs of loyalty. Several Confederate regimental bands included slaves, and Confederates arranged slaves to sing and dance to show how happy they were. Slave performer [[Blind Tom Wiggins|Thomas Greene Bethune]], known as Blind Tom frequently played pro-Confederate songs such as \"Maryland, My Maryland\" and \"Dixie\" during this period and dropped, \"Yankee Doodle\" from his performances.<ref>McWhirter 2012, p154</ref>\n\n==Disaffection==\nSlave uprisings were a constant fear of slaveholders before and during the war. A slave insurrection was planned in [[Adams County, Mississippi]], which was uncovered in the summer of 1861 leading to widespread punishment of slaves in the area.<ref>Woodward 2014, p17-18</ref> In June 1861, an aborted insurrection occurred in [[St. Martin's Parish, Louisiana]], which resulted in the arrest of forty slaves and the arrest of two white men who led the uprising, one of whom was arrested and the other who escaped. In August 1861, a possible uprising in [[Jefferson County, Alabama]] involving possibly 400 slaves was put down. Slaveholders in mountainous country particular feared uprising as the terrain made slaves more difficult to monitor.<ref>Woodward 2014, p17-18</ref>\n\n[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|right|Peter or [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], a whipped slave, photo taken at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], 1863; the guilty overseer was fired.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kathleen|last=Collins|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Letters-t-ASLAVENAMEDG_LETTERS.html?_r=0|title=The Scourged Back|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=History of Photography|date=January 9, 1985|pages=43\u201345}}</ref>]]\nPhysical punishment had a prominent place in slave society and this extended to slaves in the Confederate Army, who were frequently whipped or punished in other ways. Slaves were occasionally rewarded for good behavior, but there was a belief that punishment was a more effective means of maintaining control. Punishments sometimes extended to include maiming, murder, rape, and the selling of loved ones, the last of these being often considered one of the most severe punishments.<ref>Woodward 2014, p92-94</ref>\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Harriet Tubman Civil War Woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|A woodcut of [[Harriet Tubman]] in her [[American Civil War|Civil War]] clothing]]\nSlave resistance was widespread during and before the Civil War. One important outcome of that resistance was the effect it had on Southern troop morale as it undermined the belief that black people were more loyal to the Confederacy than the Union.<ref>Woodward 2014, p105</ref> Generally, African Americans cheered for Union victory and the Confederacy made a great effort to keep slaves under their control.<ref>Woodward 2014, p91</ref> After the war, Confederate veterans downplayed this resistance and professed to believe most slaves were loyal at heart.<ref>Woodward 2014, p105</ref> In reality, slave resistance was common and widespread. On farms and plantations, slaves broke equipment, feigned illness, slowed or stopped work, stole, plotted revolts, and fled.<ref>Woodward 2014, p107</ref> White's and blacks mobilized to help escaping slaves, following what was known as the [[Underground Railroad]], and cementing the fame of individuals such as [[Harriet Tubman]].<ref>Clinton 2004</ref> Slave-owners were greatly disconcerted by the desire of their slaves to flee to Union armies, many genuinely believed slaves were tied by deep feelings and blamed abolitionist propaganda and the ignorance of slaves of the costs of freedom for their desire for freedom.<ref>Boles 2015, p185</ref> Slaves also recognized that freedom by the sword may not be permanent and preferred to bide their time until an opportunity for freedom was assured, while others feared the uncertainty of a change in their current situation. However, most slaves chose freedom when the opportunity allowed. Where possible, many slave owners fled advancing Union armies and brought their slaves with them. In situations such as along the Atlantic coast and Mississippi river where Union advance was very fast and such arrangements were not made, fleeing slave owners left their slaves behind and many slaves escaped to the Union. Fleeing slave-owners from [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]] often moved to Texas and the roads to Texas were said to be crowded with blacks.<ref>Boles 2015, p184</ref>\n\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Eastman Johnson]] (American, 1824\u20131906). ''A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves (recto)'', ca. 1862. Oil on paperboard. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nEstimates of the number of runaways during the war vary. Secretary of War [[William Seward]] estimated that the Union Army seized about 200,000 slaves, while historians of estimated figures from 500,000 to 1,000,000.<ref>Woodward 2014, p107</ref> Slaves often disguised their feelings from their masters, wishing to appear loyal but watching and waiting for a chance to at freedom. Some slaves were willing to risk their lives and families, while others were not. Many and perhaps most slaves were governable during the war, especially in the early years.<ref>Woodward 2014, p107-108</ref> Escaping slaves who were caught on their way to freedom were usually very harshly dealt with and frequently executed.<ref>Woodward 2014, p120</ref>\n\nConfederates emphasized negative aspects of the transition from slavery to freedom in discussions with their slaves and in letters and conversations during the period. Letters from captured Confederate soldiers noted the poor housing conditions and dress of freedmen they saw in Union held cities. Indeed, disease and lack of medical care were major issues in Federal camps set up for the freedmen, and some former slaves were sent to local planters where conditions were better. In Federal hands, there were cases of rape and other brutalities, and there were social and labor issues among the freedpeople. For instance, looking for work, in some cases, female slaves turned to prostitution.<ref>Woodward 2014, p119-120</ref>\n\nIn spite of evidences of the desire of slaves to be free, the \"loyal slave\" fixed itself in the consciousness of many white southerners during and after the war. This image had some grounding in fact, and examples of personal bond, sense of duty, or other calculations leading slaves to remain loyal exist. There are also examples of slaves who served masters serving in the Confederate Army, protecting women and children from assault by federal troops, or assisting aging or wounded masters when escape was possible.<ref>Boles 2015, p183</ref>\n\n==Slaves in the Confederate service==\n{{see also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\nThe Confederacy's early military successes depended significantly on slavery. Slaves provided agricultural and industrial labor, constructed fortifications, repaired railroads, and freed up white men to serve as soldiers.<ref>Smith 2013, p9-10</ref>  Tens of thousands of slaves were used to build and repair fortifications and railroads, as haulers, teamsters, ditch diggers, and assisting medical workers.<ref>Woodward 2014, p56</ref> In their role, slaves in the army were heavily relied on and in some cases overworked to the point of illness or death.<ref>Woodward 2014, p58, 66-67</ref>\n\n[[File:Sergeant A.M. Chandler of the 44th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, Co. F., and Silas Chandler, family slave, with Bowie knives, revolvers, pepper-box, shotgun, and canteen.jpg|thumb|Sergeant A.M. Chandler of the 44th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, Co. F., and [[Silas Chandler]], family slave]]\nAnother role slaves played during the war was camp servants. This role was more common in large, encamped armies than among home guard or guerilla units. Camp servants served their master and not the government and served officers and enlisted soldiers. Most Confederates could not, of course, afford this luxury, but they were not rare.<ref>Woodward 2014, p81-82</ref> In cases where camp servants were not enslaved, servants could receive a significant salary. It was also not uncommon for slaves to be paid or to keep a portion of the earnings derived from their labor. In one case, a soldier reported a slave receiving $4 for a week's washing and cooking, and in another servant, labor was reported to receive payments in excess of a private's pre-1864 monthly pay of $11.<ref>Woodward 2014, p83-84</ref>\n\nConfederates frequently wrote about the care slaves had for their dying or deceased masters. This care represented the benign relationship between slaves and masters in the minds of Confederates. Historians have questioned whether the care taken represented affection or was due to anxiety about the fate of the slaves themselves after the death of their masters.<ref>Woodward 2014, p90-91</ref> On the other hand, physical punishment had a prominent place in slave society and this extended to slaves in the Confederate Army, who were frequently whipped or punished in other ways. Slaves were occasionally rewarded for good behavior, but there was a belief that punishment was a more effective means of maintaining control. Punishments sometimes extended to include maiming, murder, rape, and the selling of loved ones, the last of these being often considered the most severe punishment.<ref>Woodward 2014, p92-94</ref>\n\nThe role of slavery on the size of the Confederate Army was complicated. While the use of slave labor in camps freed white soldiers to fight, the population was said to be more willing to send their white men to the army than risk the life and labor of their slaves.<ref>Woodward 2014, p56</ref> In October 1862, the Confederacy passed a draft bill known as the \"[[Twenty Slave Law]]\" that allowed one white male to stay behind on plantations with twenty or more slaves, which was meant to protect property on large plantations but also alienated many non-slaveholders in the south.<ref>Woodward 2014, p47-48</ref>\n\n===Impressment===\nThe Confederate Congress passed a slave impressment law on March 26, 1863. This law raised questions about whether or not the Confederacy could seize free blacks, who numbered about 260,000 in the South in 1860. The Virginia legislature dealt with this issue by subjecting free blacks to the Confederate draft to serve in non-combat roles and limiting the number of slaves the government could impress. In this way, commanders in Virginia had the power to force free and enslaved blacks into service. However, a limited number of free blacks were actually impressed. In part, this is because the proportion of free blacks who were males of military age was relatively small and many of those were already working in military-related tasks.<ref>Woodward 2014, p64-65</ref>\nFor much of the war, Confederate soldiers were relatively comfortable and well supplied. However, by the spring of 1864, the situation tightened. On March 4, 1864, Confederate General Order No 28 said that officers and enlisted men would receive one ration per day, giving no consideration for body servants. A number of commanders protested and a letter was sent to the government on March 19 signed by officers including Generals [[Richard Ewell]], [[Jubal Early]], [[Stephen Dodson Ramseur|Stephen Ramseur]], and [[John Brown Gordon|John Gordon]] requesting an increase in rations to account for servants.<ref>Woodward 2014, p86-87</ref>\n\nSlave labor was not free of the perils of war, and Confederates occasionally wrote about slave laborers facing enemy shelling.<ref>Woodward 2014, p66</ref> While slave-owners expected compensation when slaves died in the service of the Confederate Army, most Confederates did not own slaves and preferred a dead black worker than a dead white one. Thus, the hazardous conditions of slave labor may have been in part premeditated<ref>Woodward 2014, p58, 66-67</ref>\n\nIn some cases, a plantation's slaves were asked for volunteer to join the army, and some were excited for the change in tasks.<ref>Woodward 2014, p58</ref> However, the Confederacy had more need for laborers than was filled by slaves. In part, this was exacerbated by the refusal of white Confederate soldiers to join in the necessary labor in many cases.<ref>Woodward 2014, p59</ref> The Confederate government set up impressment bureaus to ensure slaveholders furnished enough slaves. In Texas in June 1863, district commander [[John B. Magruder|John Magruder]] was put in charge of one such bureau, and Magruder was known for his ability to usually succeed in appeals to slaveholder patriotism to acquire slaves rather than impressment.<ref>Woodward 2014, p70-71</ref> In the West, General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] led numerous cavalry raids where he captured many slaves who had fled behind Union lines, often sending excess to other commands.<ref>Woodward 2014, p77</ref> Confederate forces also made raids on Union controlled plantations in the south, particularly along the Mississippi river.<ref>Woodward 2014, p120</ref> When Confederate forces marched North, such as during the [[Gettysburg campaign]] under [[Robert E. Lee]], Confederates in [[Pennsylvania]] rounded up as many blacks as possible, whether they were free before the war or not. These individuals became part of the spoils of war.<ref>Woodward 2014, p121</ref> Northerners asked camp servants in the Confederate Army marching in the north why they did not flee to freedom. It would have been difficult for them to escape during the campaign, however. Fleeing to the north may not have seemed like an appealing option as, in some cases, northerners expressed their racism and dislike for blacks in the presence of Confederate soldiers and servants.<ref>Woodward 2014, p121</ref>\n\nEven before the government authorized the impressment of slaves, officers forced thousands of slaves to work, and the scale of slave projects during the war was greater than those present on plantations, where only one master's slaves worked. Slaves built fortifications at Richmond, [[Fort Henry, Tennessee|Fort Henry]], [[Fort Donelson]], [[Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]], [[Wilmington, North Carolina in the American Civil War|Wilmington]], and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. In September 1862, Confederate General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] was in charge of coastal defenses in South Carolina and Georgia and had 1,400 slaves working on the fortifications at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. In May 1862, 7,500 slaves were said to be working at Mobile. In the spring of 1863, between 4,000 and 6,000 slaves were said to be working on the railways running into Richmond.<ref>Woodward 2014, p58</ref> In November 1862, Robert E. Lee was in charge of defenses of the [[North Carolina]], South Carolina, and Georgia coasts and had 3,330 slaves working in the fortifications at Wilmington.<ref>Woodward 2014, p63</ref> Slave labor on fortifications ultimately undermined slavery, as it served as justification for the Confiscation acts and ultimately the 13th Amendment discussed below.<ref>Martinez 2013, p17</ref>\n\nNear the war's end, slaves were in high demand to fortify the last bastions of the Confederacy. In the defense of [[Atlanta]], General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] called for 12,000 slaves to join his army as teamsters and cooks, but such a large number was never furnished for any general, although slaves were an important part of the campaign, building fallback lines for the stubbornly retreating Confederate army to man. At Richmond, Lee received 2,000 or his requested 5,000 to relieve white teamsters for duty in the lines.<ref>Woodward 2014, p75-76</ref>\n\nNear the end of the war, the Confederacy made efforts to enlist black soldiers. In November 1864, Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] called on the Confederate Congress to purchase 40,000 slaves who would then be emancipated in return for military service. Such calls were very contentious in the south, with General [[Patrick Cleburne]] being a leading proponent of arming slaves. Among the opposition to the idea, General [[Howell Cobb]] argued in January 1865, \"If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" As the Confederacy collapsed in early 1864 and 1865, arming slaves became, in the words of General Robert E. Lee, \"not only expedient but necessary.\" In March 1865, Davis authorized the enlistment of blacks to the Confederate army and companies began to form by March 25. However, Confederate forces in Virginia surrendered on April 3 and the war was over on April 9, 1865, before black soldiers had a chance to fight on the Confederate side.<ref>Boles 2015, p197-198</ref>\n\n==Contraband==\n[[File:Gunboat Planter.png|thumb|The gunboat [[USS Planter (1862)|USS ''Planter'']], stolen and run out of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] by escaping slave and future Congressman, [[Robert Smalls]], in May 1862]]\nAt the outset of the war, Abraham Lincoln hoped to keep the Union intact with or without slavery.<ref>Smith 2013, p9</ref> Early in the war, there was belief that the conflict would be chivalric in character and northern Generals hesitated to aid escaping slaves. but by 1862, the bitterness of the conflict became clear and Federals began to seize slaves in ernest.<ref>Woodward 2014, p110</ref> As early as May 1861, Union General [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in command at [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]], unilaterally refused to return escaped slaves who reached Federal lines to their slave-owners. Instead, Butler employed them in the quartermaster department, reasoning that returning the slaves would aid the enemy, and the [[Grand Contraband Camp, Virginia]] was formed. Lincoln allowed Butler's policy to stand, and on August 6, 1861, Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862|First Confiscation Act]] which allowed the government to seize all property used by the Confederacy, including slaves. However, Union commanders were officially instructed to exclude runaway slaves until July 1862, when Lincoln admitted the importance of allowing slaves to escape to Union lines was a military necessity.<ref>Smith 2013, p10-11</ref> The escaped slaves came to be known as \"contrabands\" and over two hundred thousand such individuals came to work for the Union Army. Initially, contrabands worked as teamsters, blacksmiths, cooks, coopers, carpenters, bakers, butchers, laundresses, personal servants, and performed other menial duties. Over the course of the war, many contraband took on more formal employment in support of the Union Army, particularly as cattle drivers, stevedores, and pioneer laborers.<ref>Smith 2013, p11</ref> Lincoln feared the 1861 Confiscation Act would drive Border States into the Confederacy and was opposed by efforts of Union General [[John C. Fremont]] and of Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] to push forward emancipation and enlistment of black soldiers respectively.<ref>Smith 2013, p11-12</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some Union Army Generals kept a practice of returning escaped slaves to their masters, particularly democrats such as Generals [[Henry Halleck]], [[George B. McClellan]], and [[Don Carlos Buell]]. Halleck's General Order No. 3 barred fugitive slaves from his lines.<ref>Woodward 2014, p108-109</ref>\n\nHowever, slaves strongly desired to be free and to contribute to their own emancipation.<ref>Smith 2013, p10</ref> Blacks were fundamental in engendering anti-slavery and emancipation sentiment in the north. Union soldiers saw the scars on the bodies of slaves they encountered marching in the south and saw the relative squalor in which they lived. They heard the stories of slaves and saw their willingness to fight for their own freedom and join the Union Army.<ref>Manning 2007, p77</ref>\n\nThis willingness to fight was irresistible to Union Generals in need of manpower. Since 1792, Federal law prohibited black men from serving in the state militias and the U.S. Army, but that changed during the war.<ref>Smith 2013, p9</ref> In May 1862, General [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|James H. Lane]] in Kansas and [[John W. Phelps]] in Louisiana began to enlist black men into regiments without War Department authorization. Lane's efforts resulted in the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored)|First Kansas Colored Volunteers]] while Phelps was opposed by his superior, General Butler, who, desperate for reinforcements, relented in August 1862 resulting in the [[Louisiana Native Guards]], which was made up largely of freemen.<ref>Smith 2013, p13-14</ref> Also in May 1862, General [[David Hunter]] proclaimed martial law and ordered slaves freed in the area around his command at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast, a command which included sections of coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. On May 19, Lincoln annulled Hunter's emancipation decree, but remained silent on aspects of Hunter's proclamation involving the enlistment of slaves.<ref>Smith 2013, p13-14</ref> Among the few black officers in these early regiments were freemen [[William D. Matthews]] and [[Caesar Antoine]].\n\nIn September 1862, Stanton authorized General [[Rufus Saxton]], who had taken Hunter's position in command of parts of coastal South Carolina, to arm blacks to help guard coastal plantations, leading to the [[First South Carolina Colored Volunteers]] in 1862 and the establishment of colonies at places like [[Edisto Island during the American Civil War|Edisto Island]] and [[Port Royal Experiment|Port Royal]].<ref>Smith 2013, p15-16</ref> Hunter's recruitment of blacks was debated in Congress, with [[Charles A. Wickliffe]] and [[Robert Mallory]] of Kentucky opposing the efforts and [[Thaddeus Stevens]] leading the support. Lincoln's quiet official policies in favor of emancipation and enlistment of slaves and loud repudiation of Hunter and Fremont led to criticism by many abolitionists such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]].<ref>Smith 2013, p16</ref>\n\n==Emancipation==\n{{main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\nExecutive and legislative efforts to end slavery started early in the war. In November 1861, Lincoln proposed a plan of compensated emancipation for slaves in the state of Delaware, a proposal which was rejected by the [[Delaware]] legislature. Lincoln proposed compensated emancipation programs again in early 1862 estimating that such a policy for Border States would be less expensive than continued war. The appeal was again rejected in March 1862. A third attempt was made on July 12, 1862 when representatives of Border States rejected a compensated emancipation plan proposed by Lincoln.<ref>Smith 2013, p17-19</ref> In March 1862, Congress enacted an Article of War circumventing much of the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]] of 1793 and 1850, and in April Congress abolished slavery in Washington D. C. compensating slaveholders and offering money to assist in immigration of slaves to [[Haiti]] or [[Liberia]]. In June, Congress emancipated slaves in [[United States territories|Federal territories]] without compensation, overturning the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision of 1857.<ref>Smith 2013, p18</ref>\n\nAfter the repeated rejection of compensated emancipation plans, Lincoln began to contemplate a presidential emancipation decree in mid-1862. On July 17, 1862, Congress passed the [[Militia Act of 1862|Militia Act]] which emancipated Confederate bondsmen employed by the Union army and authorized the president to receive into service blacks for \"any military or naval service for which they may be found competent\", authorizing the enlistment of blacks although intended to only apply to slaves of disloyal slave-owners and not to free blacks or slaves of loyal border state slave-owners. That same day, congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862|Second Confiscation Act]], which authorized the emancipation of slaves of people engaged in rebellion.<ref>Smith 2013, p19-20</ref> Lincoln was slow to enact the provisions of the Second Confiscation Act, which was criticized by abolitionists, particularly Frederick Douglass.<ref>Smith 2013, p20</ref>\n\n{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}\nOn July 21, 1862, four days after signing the Militia and Second Confiscation Acts, Lincoln met with his cabinet to inform them that he intended to implement the military and emancipation provisions of the acts, but not the colonization, and the next day he shared with the cabinet the preliminary emancipation proclamation. His proposal would extend to slaves beyond those under Federal Control and would be made as a war measure, which could circumvent the courts and legislature. In order to avoid alienating Border States, particularly Kentucky, Lincoln chose not to unveil his new position until the New Year.<ref>Smith 2013, p22-23</ref> In part, this decision to delay stemmed from a desire to wait to make the proclamation until the Union Army had made some advances to ensure that the proclamation did not to appear to be made out of desperation. McClellan's victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in late summer 1862 gave Lincoln political capital, which was important in allowing Lincoln to issue his emancipation proclamation.<ref>Boles 2015, p190-191</ref> Abolitionists such as [[Frederick Douglass]] greatly approved Lincoln's new position, writing, \"The white man is liberated, the black man is liberated, the brave men now fighting in the battles of their country against rebels and traitors are now liberated...\"<ref>Smith 2013, p25</ref>\n\nThe proclamation did receive some criticism, particularly from the South. It also only freed slaves in Confederate controlled areas, exempting about 800,000 of the country's 2.9 million slaves. In addition, it depended on Union gains in the war for its enforcement.<ref>Smith 2013, p26</ref> Among opponents were General [[William T. Sherman]], who frequently complained about emancipation and enlistment but who complied with the edicts.<ref>Smith 2013, p31</ref>\n\n[[File:Timothy H. O'Sullivan (American - Slaves, J. J. Smith's Plantation, South Carolina - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Freed slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation on the Sea Islands near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan|Timothy O'Sullivan]] standing before their quarters in 1862]]\nThroughout the war, slaves were emancipating themselves. The two major events which allowed slaves to choose freedom were the increased possibility of escaping as white men who otherwise controlled slaves leaving the plantations for the Confederate Army and the advance of Union troops into close proximity. To prevent the former, attempts were made to better organize slave patrol and use the militia for such control, but these were less effective because the slave owners especially experienced in keeping their own slaves in bondage were often away in the Army.<ref>Boles 2015, p186</ref> The advance of the Union Army had large effect on slavery in the areas they came to control. The first region the Union Army captured was the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia. Confederates reported that after their masters fled, the slaves in those areas pillaged their masters' property. The Union also made gains in western [[Kentucky]], western [[Tennessee]], and northern Mississippi.<ref>Woodward 2014, p110</ref>\n\nOccupying Union forces made a number of efforts to provide for freed slaves. In Tennessee, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] appointed [[John Eaton, Jr.]] to be in charge of fugitives, and a camp was established at [[Grand Junction, Tennessee]], later moved to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], which organized these efforts. The camp provided shelter, food, and a small amount of medical attention. It also centralized the hiring of freedmen to whites who leased abandoned plantations; transforming agriculture in Union held areas from a slave to a wage based labor system. This same system had already been implemented in 1862 along the South Carolina coast in the Port Royal experiment. Efforts were not universally successful, as tension developed between goals of efficiency and of black autonomy. In several locations, including Jefferson Davis' properties at [[Davis Bend, Mississippi]], freed blacks were allotted land and given direct control. In spite of these examples, most freed slaves shifted to wage laborers, which were more similar to sharecropping than real freedom. This failure of provision of a solid economic footing for freed slaves has been considered a cause of the failure of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref>Boles 2015, p191-192</ref>\n\n===Colored Troops===\n{{main|United States Colored Troops}}\n{{see also|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War}}\n[[Image:Company I of the 36th Colored Regiment.jpg|thumb|right|A company of 4th [[United States Colored Troops]] (USCT). USCT regiments formed up to a tenth of the [[Union army]].]]\nAfter the Emancipation Proclamation, black soldiers became commonplace and eventually numbered 178,895 with 133,000 coming from slave states and mostly consisting of former slaves. Northerners were initially uncomfortable arming blacks and black troops were usually placed under white officers. They were also given inferior equipment and medical care and assigned disproportionate amounts of heavy labor. However, the success of these regiments led to a change in prospective. The Confederate government and army were infuriated with the northern use of black soldiers, seeing such troops as slave insurrectionaries and subjecting captured black soldiers to re-enslavement or death for treason.<ref>Boles 2015, p193-194</ref> In December 1862, Jefferson Davis issued what has been called the \"Anti-Emancipation Proclamation\" which declared that the Confederate Army would return to slavery any black man found in Federal Uniform and turn over to the states any slaves found aiding Northern units; and would do the same with white officers of black regiments.<ref>Woodward 2014, p134</ref> This led to Lincoln threatening to kill a captured rebel soldier for every black Union soldier killed in captivity, and that every captured black soldier committed to slavery would be responded to by giving a Confederate captive hard labor. No official retaliations of this sort occurred.<ref>Boles 2015, p193-194</ref>\n\n[[Image:The Storming of Ft Wagner-lithograph by Kurz and Allison 1890.jpg|thumb|A lithograph of the storming of [[Fort Wagner]].]]\nBlack troops were not considered equal, neither by Federals or Confederates. Black soldiers were often exposed to more difficult conditions and had worse medical care. The mortality rate for black soldiers was about 40% higher than that for white troops, and over 38,000 black soldiers died from all causes.<ref>Boles 2015, p195</ref> On the battlefield, Black soldiers performed well, earning the respect of Union and Confederate Troops alike. However, Confederate victories against black soldiers led to atrocities where surrendering black Union soldiers were executed by Confederates. Two of the most notable such occurrences were in 1864 in the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]] in Tennessee and the [[Battle of the Crater]] in Virginia. Evidence is mixed over whether or not there was an official no-quarter policy, but at these victories, black soldiers were killed at a greatly disproportionate ratio.<ref>Woodward 2014, p148-150</ref>\n\n==Attitudes of whites==\nFeelings of whites about slavery during this period has also been the subject of study. Generally, poor, non-slaveholding whites in the south admired planters and sought to own slaves themselves.<ref>Woodward 2014, p52</ref> During the war, Confederate soldiers were optimistic about the prospects for the survival of the Confederacy and the institution of slavery well into 1864.<ref>Woodward 2014, p74</ref> Confederates feared the Emancipation Proclamation would lead to slave uprisings, an occurrence which even northerners did not desire. Although most people at that time had not been born at the time of the Nat Turner Revolt or the revolution in Haiti, but insurrections were greatly feared.<ref>Woodward 2014, p113-114</ref> Also, the north was not united against slavery, and many Union troops desired that the United States, win or lose, be a white man's country. However, it was clear to all that Lincoln's party, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was in favor of eventual if not immediate emancipation.<ref>Woodward 2014, p114-115</ref>\n\nWhile most historians agree that the war erupted over a debate about slavery, the role of slavery in the motivation of soldiers had been the subject of widespread debate. J. Tracy Power in ''Lee's Miserables'' and Stephen Berry in ''All That Makes a Man'' argued that Confederate soldiers did not think much about slavery. Others such as Chandra Manning in ''What This Cruel War Was Over'', Jason Phillips in ''Diehard Rebels'', Joseph Glatthaar in The ''New Civil War History'' and ''General Lee's Army'', Aaron Sheehan-Deen in ''Why Confederates Fought'', Kenneth Noe in ''Reluctant Rebels'', and James McPherson in ''For Cause and Comrades'' argued that slavery was central in the mindset of many Confederate soldiers. The issue in the mind and motivation of Union soldiers has also been debated. Manning's ''What This Cruel War Was Over'' is an example discussing the importance of slavery for Union soldiers.<ref>Woodward 2014, p4-7</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{main|Reconstruction Era}}\nAt the beginning of 1865, millions of black people remained as slaves, but the institution was crumbling. As the Confederate Army weakened, the Confederacy's ability to assert racial control lessened and large numbers of slaves were escaping to federal lines every day. Even as the large Armies surrendered, some Confederates held on to hope for victory and for the reassertion of slavery throughout the South.<ref>Woodward 2014, p181-183</ref> At the wars end, some Southern whites fled to South America where they could escape Federal law, and in some cases, continue slaveholding, although such cases were the exception.<ref>Woodward 2014, p185</ref>\n\nSlaves saw emancipation as more than an end to slavery, but also education, voting rights, and rights before the law.<ref>Manning 2007, p158</ref> The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] passed in January 1865 ending slavery in the Union and ensuring that under US control, slaves in the south would be freed.<ref>Woodward 2014, p180</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended, a narrative of faithful slaves arose in the south, with stories of slaves marching with their masters or celebrating the return of soldiers to the plantations. Blacks living in the south were no longer slaves, but most remained and worked for their former masters. Even so, racial tensions grew greatly during the Reconstruction era.<ref>Woodward 2014, p187</ref> White supremacy grew as well, represented by the growth of the militancy of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the growth of belief in the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]] movement.<ref>Woodward 2014, p192</ref> The KKK was a radical supremacist group that persecuted African Americans and African American supporters.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Boles, John B.

The film is set but was not filmed in [[Xenia, Ohio]], a [[Midwestern America]]n town that had been previously struck by [[Xenia Tornado|a devastating tornado]]. The loose narrative follows several main characters who find odd and destructive ways to pass time, interrupted by vignettes depicting other inhabitants of the town.\n\nKorine's [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], the film was shot in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on a budget of $1 million. ''Gummo'' was [[Limited release|not given a large theatrical release]] and failed to generate large box office revenues. The film generated substantial press for its graphic content and stylized, loosely woven narrative. It is often regarded as one of the most well-known [[cult film]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nA grainy-voiced narrator (Solomon) recounts the events of the tornado while disturbing home-movie images play \u2014 mostly of the town's people. A [[Muteness|mute]] [[adolescence|adolescent]] boy, known as Bunny Boy, wears only pink bunny ears, shorts, and tennis shoes on an overpass in the rain.\n\nA cat is carried by the scruff of its neck by Tummler, a teenage boy. He drowns the cat in a barrel of water. The film then cuts to a different scene with Tummler, in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle each other, and Tummler realizes there is a lump in one of the girl's breasts.\n\nTummler and Solomon then ride down a hill on bikes. The narrator introduces Tummler as a boy with \"a marvelous persona\", whom some people call \"downright evil\". Later, Tummler aims an air rifle at a cat. His friend Solomon stops him from killing the cat, protesting that it is a house cat. They leave and the camera follows the cat to its owners' house. The cat is owned by three sisters, two of whom are teenagers and one who is pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]].\n\nThe film cuts back to Tummler and Solomon, who are hunting [[feral]] cats. They bring the cats to a local grocer, who intends to butcher and sell them to a local restaurant, and the grocer tells them that they have a rival in the cat killing business. They then buy glue from the grocer, which they use to get high via [[Inhalant abuse|huffing]].\n\nThe film then cuts to a scene in which two [[Profanity|foul-mouthed]] young boys dressed as cowboys destroy things in a junkyard. Bunny Boy arrives and the other boys shoot him \"dead\" with [[cap gun]]s. Bunny Boy plays dead and the boys curse at him, rifle through his pockets, then remove and throw one of his shoes. They grow bored of this and leave him sprawled on the ground.\n\nTummler and Solomon track down a local boy who is poaching \"their\" cats. The poacher, named Jarrod Wiggley, is poisoning the cats rather than shooting them. When Tummler and Solomon break into Jarrod's house with masks and weapons with intent to hurt him, they find photos of the young teen in drag and his elderly grandmother, who is [[Catatonia|catatonic]] and attached to [[life support]] machinery. The poacher Jarrod is forced to care for her, which he had earlier opined was \"disgusting\". Seeing that Jarrod isn't home, Tummler and Solomon decide to leave. Tummler then discovers the grandmother lying in her bed, states that it is \"no way to live,\" and turns off the life support machine.\n\nA number of other scenes are interspersed throughout the film, including: an intoxicated man (played by [[Harmony Korine]]) flirting with a [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]; a man pimping his [[Down syndrome]]-afflicted sister to Solomon and Tummler; the sisters encountering an elderly [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]; a pair of twin boys selling candy door-to-door; a brief conversation with a tennis player who is treating his [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]]; a long scene of Solomon eating dinner while taking a bath in dirty water; a drunken party with [[Arm wrestling|arm-]] and chair-wrestling; and two [[skinhead]] brothers boxing each other in their kitchen. There are also a number of even smaller scenes depicting [[Satanism|Satanic rituals]], footage seemingly from home movies, and conversations containing racial bigotry.\n\nThe next scene in the movie is set to the song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]], which had been previously mentioned by Tummler as the song his older brother, who was a transsexual, would sing (the brother eventually went to the \"Big City\" and abandoned him). The final scene involves Solomon and Tummler shooting the sisters' cat repeatedly with their air rifles in the rain with jump cuts to Bunny Boy kissing the teenage girls in a swimming pool. Bunny Boy runs towards the camera through a field holding the body of the dead cat, which he shows to the audience, breaking the [[fourth wall]].\n\nThe final scene shows a girl, who shaved her eyebrows earlier in the movie, singing \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" in front of her parents in bed. The film finally cuts to black as they tell her to go to bed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jacob Reynolds]] as Solomon\n* Nick Sutton as Tummler\n* [[Linda Manz]] as Solomon's mother\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Dot\n* Carisa Glucksman as Helen\n* Darby Dougherty as Darby\n* Jacob Sewell as Bunny Boy\n* [[Mark Gonzales]] as Chair wrestler\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Cole\n* Daniel Martin as Jarrod Wiggley\n* [[Harmony Korine]] as Boy on couch\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn writing ''Gummo'', [[Harmony Korine]] abandoned traditional three-act plot structure and worked to avoid creating characters of a clear-cut moral dimension. In favor of a collage-like assembly, Korine focused on forming interesting moments and scenes, that when put in succession would become its own unique narrative. To justify such a chaotic assembly, Korine set his film in Xenia, Ohio which had been hit by a tornado in 1974.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\nTo help him achieve his vision, Korine sought out French cinematographer [[Jean-Yves Escoffier]]. His work on [[Leos Carax]]'s ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]]'' made a tremendous impression on Korine. Escoffier, who liked the script, worked on ''Gummo'' for a fraction of his usual rate.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\nDuring the months of pre-production, Korine scouted for locations in his hometown of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], filming unusual and distinctive homes to shoot in. Korine often approached people on the street, in bowling alleys and in fast food restaurants and asked them to play a part in his movie. Korine notes, \"This is where I grew up. These people are interesting to me, and I'd never seen them represented on screen in a true way.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n[[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] designed the costumes for the film, mixing pieces that people already owned with items bought at local thrift stores.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nKorine cast the film almost entirely with local non-actors. Old friends were eager to help Korine, such as the two skinhead brothers, skateboarder [[Mark Gonzales]], and dwarf Bryant Krenshaw. Some exceptions include Korine's then-girlfriend [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Linda Manz]], and [[Max Perlich]].\n\nOn [[Linda Manz]], Korine stated, \"I had always admired her. There was this sense about her that I liked \u2013 it wasn't even acting. It was like the way I felt about [[Buster Keaton]] when I first saw him. There was a kind of poetry about her, a glow. They both burnt off the screen.\"<ref name=\"Walczak\">Walczak, Dantek. 1997. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/indexmag.html Harmony Korine Interview].\" Index Magazine.

Some people had just gotten out of prison and Korine felt the performance would be greater if he wasn't in the room. The crew shut all the doors and turned off all the monitors, so no one knew what was going on. In between takes, Korine would run in and get everyone hyped up.

The film is set but was not filmed in [[Xenia, Ohio]], a [[Midwestern America]]n town that had been previously struck by [[Xenia Tornado|a devastating tornado]]. The loose narrative follows several main characters who find odd and destructive ways to pass time, interrupted by vignettes depicting other inhabitants of the town.\n\nKorine's [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], the film was shot in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on a budget of $1 million. ''Gummo'' was [[Limited release|not given a large theatrical release]] and failed to generate large box office revenues. The film generated substantial press for its graphic content and stylized, loosely woven narrative. It is often regarded as one of the most well-known [[cult film]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nA grainy-voiced narrator (Solomon) recounts the events of the tornado while disturbing home-movie images play \u2014 mostly of the town's people. A [[Muteness|mute]] [[adolescence|adolescent]] boy, known as Bunny Boy, wears only pink bunny ears, shorts, and tennis shoes on an overpass in the rain.\n\nA cat is carried by the scruff of its neck by Tummler, a teenage boy. He drowns the cat in a barrel of water. The film then cuts to a different scene with Tummler, in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle each other, and Tummler realizes there is a lump in one of the girl's breasts.\n\nTummler and Solomon then ride down a hill on bikes. The narrator introduces Tummler as a boy with \"a marvelous persona\", whom some people call \"downright evil\". Later, Tummler aims an air rifle at a cat. His friend Solomon stops him from killing the cat, protesting that it is a house cat. They leave and the camera follows the cat to its owners' house. The cat is owned by three sisters, two of whom are teenagers and one who is pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]].\n\nThe film cuts back to Tummler and Solomon, who are hunting [[feral]] cats. They bring the cats to a local grocer, who intends to butcher and sell them to a local restaurant, and the grocer tells them that they have a rival in the cat killing business. They then buy glue from the grocer, which they use to get high via [[Inhalant abuse|huffing]].\n\nThe film then cuts to a scene in which two [[Profanity|foul-mouthed]] young boys dressed as cowboys destroy things in a junkyard. Bunny Boy arrives and the other boys shoot him \"dead\" with [[cap gun]]s. Bunny Boy plays dead and the boys curse at him, rifle his pockets, then remove and throw one of his shoes. They grow bored of this and leave him sprawled on the ground.\n\nTummler and Solomon track down a local boy who is poaching \"their\" cats. The poacher, named Jarrod Wiggley, is poisoning the cats rather than shooting them. When Tummler and Solomon break into Jarrod's house with masks and weapons with intent to hurt him, they find photos of the young teen in drag and his elderly grandmother, who is [[Catatonia|catatonic]] and attached to [[life support]] machinery. The poacher Jarrod is forced to care for her, which he had earlier opined was \"disgusting\". Seeing that Jarrod isn't home, Tummler and Solomon decide to leave. Tummler then discovers the grandmother lying in her bed, states that it is \"no way to live,\" and turns off the life support machine.\n\nA number of other scenes are interspersed throughout the film, including: an intoxicated man (played by [[Harmony Korine]]) flirting with a [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]; a man pimping his [[Down syndrome]]-afflicted sister to Solomon and Tummler; the sisters encountering an elderly [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]; a pair of twin boys selling candy door-to-door; a brief conversation with a tennis player who is treating his [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]]; a long scene of Solomon eating dinner while taking a bath in dirty water; a drunken party with [[Arm wrestling|arm-]] and chair-wrestling; and two [[skinhead]] brothers boxing each other in their kitchen. There are also a number of even smaller scenes depicting [[Satanism|Satanic rituals]], footage seemingly from home movies, and conversations containing racial bigotry.\n\nThe next scene in the movie is set to the song \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" by [[Roy Orbison]], which had been previously mentioned by Tummler as the song his older brother, who was a transsexual, would sing (the brother eventually went to the \"Big City\" and abandoned him). The final scene involves Solomon and Tummler shooting the sisters' cat repeatedly with their air rifles in the rain with jump cuts to Bunny Boy kissing the teenage girls in a swimming pool. Bunny Boy runs towards the camera through a field holding the body of the dead cat, which he shows to the audience, breaking the [[fourth wall]].\n\nThe final scene shows a girl, who shaved her eyebrows earlier in the movie, singing \"[[Jesus Loves Me]]\" in front of her parents in bed. The film finally cuts to black as they tell her to go to bed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jacob Reynolds]] as Solomon\n* Nick Sutton as Tummler\n* [[Linda Manz]] as Solomon's mother\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Dot\n* Carisa Glucksman as Helen\n* Darby Dougherty as Darby\n* Jacob Sewell as Bunny Boy\n* [[Mark Gonzales]] as Chair wrestler\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Cole\n* Daniel Martin as Jarrod Wiggley\n* [[Harmony Korine]] as Boy on couch\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn writing ''Gummo'', [[Harmony Korine]] abandoned traditional three-act plot structure and worked to avoid creating characters of a clear-cut moral dimension. In favor of a collage-like assembly, Korine focused on forming interesting moments and scenes, that when put in succession would become its own unique narrative. To justify such a chaotic assembly, Korine set his film in Xenia, Ohio which had been hit by a tornado in 1974.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\nTo help him achieve his vision, Korine sought out French cinematographer [[Jean-Yves Escoffier]]. His work on [[Leos Carax]]'s ''[[Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]]'' made a tremendous impression on Korine. Escoffier, who liked the script, worked on ''Gummo'' for a fraction of his usual rate.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\nDuring the months of pre-production, Korine scouted for locations in his hometown of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], filming unusual and distinctive homes to shoot in. Korine often approached people on the street, in bowling alleys and in fast food restaurants and asked them to play a part in his movie. Korine notes, \"This is where I grew up. These people are interesting to me, and I'd never seen them represented on screen in a true way.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n[[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] designed the costumes for the film, mixing pieces that people already owned with items bought at local thrift stores.<ref name=\"forward\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nKorine cast the film almost entirely with local non-actors. Old friends were eager to help Korine, such as the two skinhead brothers, skateboarder [[Mark Gonzales]], and dwarf Bryant Krenshaw. Some exceptions include Korine's then-girlfriend [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Linda Manz]], and [[Max Perlich]].\n\nOn [[Linda Manz]], Korine stated, \"I had always admired her. There was this sense about her that I liked \u2013 it wasn't even acting. It was like the way I felt about [[Buster Keaton]] when I first saw him. There was a kind of poetry about her, a glow.

I felt like shooting each scene on its own terms and then making sense of it afterwards. And I felt that the styles would blend, that there would be a cohesiveness.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\nOn the last day of shooting, Escoffier shot the chair-wrestling kitchen scene alone with a rigged boom on his camera. Some people had just gotten out of prison and Korine felt the performance would be greater if he wasn't in the room. The crew shut all the doors and turned off all the monitors, so no one knew what was going on. In between takes, Korine would run in and get everyone hyped up. At the end of the scene there is a moment of silence where no one knows what to do next. Korine comments, \"When I saw that in the dailies, it amazed me, because Jean Yves really captured that awkwardness, that sad silence; it was beautiful.\"<ref name=\"whammo\"/>\n\nKorine shot ''Gummo'' in just four weeks during the summer of 1996, most of the film being shot on the very last day of production. This was due to the crew waiting for rain.\nThe last scene shot is the one with Korine starring as a heavily intoxicated and homosexual boy on a couch with a little person.\n\nAny scenes appearing to show violence against animals were simulated, sometimes using prosthetic animals.<ref>Film, closing credits.</ref>\n\n===Editing===\nKorine worked with editor Chris Tellefsen to synthesize the pre-planned footage with the \"mistakist\" footage:\n<blockquote>\"We go from scenes that are completely thought out, almost formal, scenes that resonate in this classical film sense, and then we go to other scenes where it's like, total mistakes, stuff shot on video where the kids forget there's a camera there and talk about how much they hate [[nigger]]s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/40404-from-the-archives-mike-kelley-interviews-harmony-korine/|title=From the Archives: Mike Kelley Interviews Harmony Korine|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=February 13, 2012|accessdate=January 1, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\nKorine said that he used footage from any source he could find that fit the aesthetic: \"That cat tape was a tape that a friend of mine had given me, of him doing acid with his sister. They were in a garage band and there was a shot of their kitten. That [phasing] was an in-camera mistake.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\nThe final film is about 75% scripted.<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Gummo (soundtrack)}}\n''Gummo''{{'}}s soundtrack paints a wide canvas of American pop-culture, ranging from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", from [[Almeda Riddle]]'s field recording of the traditional children's song \"My Little Rooster\", to the [[stoner metal]] of the California band [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]]. Other popular songs include [[Buddy Holly]]'s \"Everyday\" and [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Crying\", which closes the film and is directly referenced in the dialogue.\n\nMetal and [[powerviolence]] bands such as [[Bethlehem (band)|Bethlehem]], Mystifier, [[Absu (band)|Absu]], [[Burzum]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Brujeria (band)|Brujeria]], [[Eyehategod]] and [[Spazz (band)|Spazz]] are also featured.<ref name=\"AMG-Gummo OST\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r328668|pure_url=yes}} | title=''Gummo'' \u2013 Original Soundtrack | work=[[Allmusic]]| accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> Korine later showed interest in [[black metal]] subculture in his 2000 visual series ''The Sigil of the Cloven Hoof Marks Thy Path''.\n\n==Themes==\nThe film explores a broad range of issues including drug abuse, violence, homicide, vandalism, mental illness, poverty, profanity, homophobia, sexual abuse, sexism, suicide, grief, prostitution, and animal cruelty. Korine avoided any romantic notions regarding America, including its poor and mentally handicapped.<ref name=\"cunha\"/><ref>Deussing, Ryan.

I want you to see these kids wearing Bone Thugs & Harmony t-shirts and Metallica hats \u2013 this almost schizophrenic identification with popular imagery. If you think about, that's how people relate to each other these days, through these images.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/> Dot and Helen are modeled after [[Cherie Currie]]. \"I wanted them to seem like homeschool kids... sort of guessing and coming up with these hipster things. They almost make a homeschool hip language. I wanted this inbred vernacular.\"<ref name=\"kelly\"/>\n\nThe film has a strong [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] influence. The name of the character Tummler is taken directly from the [[Tummler|vaudevillian term]] given to lower-level comics of the day. \"The guys that would check you into a hotel room, take your coat, and at the same time throw a few one-liners out. They're like the warm-up, the lowest level comedian. The tummler.\"<ref name=\"Walczak\"/> (See [[Borscht Belt]])\n\nRobin O'Hara argues that while people naturally look for points of reference to describe ''Gummo'' (such as [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], [[John Cassavetes|Cassavetes]], [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]], [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles]] and [[Derek Jarman|Jarman]]) that Korine's art really is his own. \"He is an original, in every sense of the word.\"<ref name=\"forward\"/> Korine comments on the film's aesthetic: \"We tried very hard not to reference other films.
