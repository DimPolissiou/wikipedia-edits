{"title_page": "Fathers and Sons (novel)", "text_new": "\n\nFathers and Sons\nby Ivan Turgenev\n\n\nChapter 1\n\"Well, Pyotr, still not in sight?\" was the question asked on 20th May, 1859, by a gentleman of about forty, wearing a dusty overcoat and checked trousers, who came out hatless into the low porch of the posting station at X. He was speaking to his servant, a chubby young fellow with whitish down growing on his chin and with dim little eyes.\nThe servant, in whom everything--the turquoise ring in his ear, the hair plastered down with grease and the polite flexibility of his movements--indicated a man of the new improved generation, glanced condescendingly along the road and answered, \"No, sir, definitely not in sight.\"\n\"Not in sight?\" repeated his master.\n\"No, sir,\" replied the servant again.\nHis master sighed and sat down on a little bench. We will introduce him to the reader while he sits, with his feet tucked in, looking thoughtfully around.\nHis name was Nikolai Petrovich Kirsanov. He owned, about twelve miles from the posting station, a fine property of two hundred serfs or, as he called it--since he had arranged the division of his land with the peasants--a \"farm\" of nearly five thousand acres. His father, a general in the army, who had served in 1812, a crude, almost illiterate, but good-natured type of Russian, had stuck to a routine job all his life, first commanding a brigade and later a division, and lived permanently in the provinces, where by virtue of his rank he was able to play a certain part. Nikolai Petrovich was born in south Russia, as was his elder brother Pavel, of whom we shall hear more; till the age of fourteen he was educated at home, surrounded by cheap tutors, free-and-easy but fawning adjutants, and all the usual regimental and staff people. His mother, a member of the Kolyazin family, was called Agatha as a girl, but as a general's wife her name was Agafoklea Kuzminishna Kirsanov; she was a domineering military lady, wore gorgeous caps and rustling silk dresses; in church she was the first to go up to the cross, she talked a lot in a loud voice, let her children kiss her hand every morning and gave them her blessing at night--in fact, she enjoyed her life and got as much out of it as she could. As a general's son, Nikolai Petrovich--though so far from brave that he had even been called a \"funk\"--was intended, like his brother Pavel, to enter the army; but he broke his leg on the very day he obtained a commission and after spending two months in bed he never got rid of a slight limp for the rest of his life. His father gave him up as a bad job and let him go in for the civil service. He took him to Petersburg as soon as he was eighteen and placed him in the university there. His brother happened at the same time to become an officer in a guards regiment. The young men started to share a flat together, and were kept under the remote supervision of a cousin on their mother's side, Ilya Kolyazin, an important official. Their father returned to his division and to his wife and only occasionally wrote to his sons on large sheets of grey paper, scrawled over in an ornate clerkly handwriting; the bottom of these sheets was adorned with a scroll enclosing the words, \"Pyotr Kirsanov, Major-General.\" In 1835 Nikolai Petrovich graduated from the university, and in the same year General Kirsanov was put on the retired list after an unsuccessful review, and came with his wife to live in Petersburg. He was about to take a house in the Tavrichesky Gardens, and had joined the English club, when he suddenly died of an apoplectic fit. Agafoklea Kuzminishna soon followed him to the grave; she could not adapt herself to a dull life in the capital and was consumed by the boredom of retirement from regimental existence. Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovich, during his parents' lifetime and much to their distress, had managed to fall in love with the daughter of his landlord, a petty official called Prepolovensky. She was an attractive and, as they call it, well-educated girl; she used to read the serious articles in the science column of the newspapers. He married her as soon as the period of mourning for his parents was over, and leaving the civil service, where his father had secured him a post through patronage, he started to live very happily with his Masha, first in a country villa near the Forestry Institute, afterwards in Petersburg in a pretty little flat with a clean staircase and a draughty drawing room, and finally in the country where he settled down and where in due course his son, Arkady, was born. Husband and wife lived well and peacefully; they were hardly ever separated, they read together, they sang and played duets together on the piano, she grew flowers and looked after the poultry yard, he busied himself with the estate and sometimes hunted, while Arkady went on growing in the same happy and peaceful way. Ten years passed like a dream. Then in 1847 Kirsanov's wife died. He hardly survived this blow and his hair turned grey in a few weeks; he was preparing to travel abroad, if possible to distract his thoughts . . . but then came the year 1848. He returned unwillingly to the country and after a rather long penod of inactivity he began to take an interest in improving his estate. In 1855 he brought his son to the university and spent three winters in Petersburg with him, hardly going out anywhere and trying to make acquaintance with Arkady's young comrades. The last winter he was unable to go, and here we see him in May, 1859, already entirely grey-haired, plump and rather bent, waiting for his son, who had just taken his university degree, as once he had taken it himself.\nThe servant, from a feeling of propriety, and perhaps also because he was anxious to escape from his master's eye, had gone over to the gate and was smoking a pipe. Nikolai Petrovich bowed his head and began to stare at the crumbling steps; a big mottled hen walked sedately towards him, treading firmly with its thick yellow legs; a dirty cat cast a disapproving look at him, as she twisted herself coyly round the railing. The sun was scorching; a smell of hot rye bread was wafted from the dim entrance of the posting station. Nikolai Petrovich started musing. \"My son . . . a graduate . . . Arkasha . . .\" kept on turning round in his mind; he tried to think of something else, but the same thoughts returned. He remembered his dead wife. \"She did not live to see it,\" he murmured sadly. A plump blue pigeon flew on to the road and hurriedly started to drink water from a puddle near the well. Nikolai Petrovich began to watch it, but his ear had already caught the sound of approaching wheels . . .\n\"It sounds as if they're coming, sir,\" announced the servant, emerging from the gateway.\nNikolai Petrovich jumped up and fixed his eyes on the road. A carriage appeared with three posting horses abreast; inside it he caught a glimpse of the band of a student's cap and the familiar outline of a dear face . . .\n\"Arkasha! Arkasha!\" cried Kirsanov, and he ran out into the road, waving his arms . . . A few moments later his lips were pressed to the beardless dusty sunburnt cheek of the young graduate.\nChapter 2\n\"Let me shake myself first, Daddy,\" said Arkady, in a voice rather tired from traveling but boyish and resonant, as he responded gaily to his father's greetings; \"I'm covering you with dust.\"\n\"Never mind, never mind,\" repeated Nikolai Petrovich, smiling tenderly, and struck the collar of his son's cloak and his own greatcoat with his hand. \"Let me have a look at you; just show yourself,\" he added, moving back from him, and then hurried away towards the station yard, calling out, \"This way, this way, bring the horses along at once.\nNikolai Petrovich seemed much more excited than his son; he was really rather confused and shy. Arkady stopped him.\n\"Daddy,\" he said, \"let me introduce you to my great friend, Bazarov, about whom I wrote to you so often. He has kindly agreed to come to stay with us.\"\nNikolai Petrovich turned round quickly and going up to a tall man in a long, loose rough coat with tassels, who had just climbed out of the carriage, he warmly pressed the ungloved red hand which the latter did not at once hold out to him.\n\"I am delighted,\" he began, \"and grateful for your kind intention to visit us; I hope--please tell me your name and patronymic.\"\n\"Evgeny Vassilyev,\" answered Bazarov in a lazy but manly voice, and turning back the collar of his rough overcoat he showed his whole face. It was long and thin with a broad forehead, a nose flat at the base and sharper at the end, large greenish eyes and sand-colored, drooping side whiskers; it was enlivened by a calm smile and looked self-confident and intelligent.\n\"I hope, my dear Evgeny Vassilich, that you won't be bored staying with us,\" continued Nikolai Petrovich.\nBazarov's thin lips moved slightly, but he made no answer and merely took off his cap. His fair hair, long and thick, did not hide the prominent bumps on his broad skull.\n\"Well, Arkady,\" Nikolai Petrovich began again, turning to his son, \"would you rather have the horses brought round at once or would you like to rest?\"\n\"We'll rest at home, Daddy; tell them to harness the horses.\"\n\"At once, at once,\" his father exclaimed. \"Hey, Pyotr, do you hear? Get a move on, my boy.\" Pyotr, who as a perfectly modern servant had not kissed his master's hand but only bowed to him from a distance, vanished again through the gates.\n\"I came here with the carriage, but there are three horses for your tarantass also,\" said Nikolai Petrovich fussily, while Arkady drank some water from an iron bucket brought to him by the woman in charge of the station, and Bazarov began smoking a pipe and went up to the driver, who was unharnessing the horses. \"There are only two seats in the carriage, and I don't know how your friend . . .\"\n\"He will go in the tarantass,\" interrupted Arkady in an undertone. \"Don't stand on ceremony with him, please. He's a splendid fellow, so simple--you will see.\"\nNikolai Petrovich's coachman brought the horses round.\n\"Well, make haste, bushy beard!\" said Bazarov, addressing the driver.\n\"Do you hear, Mitya,\" chipped in another driver, standing with his hands behind him thrust into the slits of his sheepskin coat, \"what the gentleman just called you? That's just what you are--a bushy beard.\"\nMitya only jerked his hat and pulled the reins off the steaming horses.\n\"Hurry up, lads, lend a hand!\" cried Nikolai Petrovich. \"There'll be something to drink our health with!\"\nIn a few minutes the horses were harnessed; father and son took their places in the carriage: Pyotr climbed on to the box; Bazarov jumped into the tarantass, leaned his head back against the leather cushion--and both vehicles rolled away.\n", "text_old": "{{infobox book |\n| name = Fathers and Sons\n| title_orig = \u041e\u0442\u0446\u044b \u0438 \u0434\u0463\u0442\u0438 (Otcy i deti)\n| image =Otsy1880.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption =Title page of the second edition (Leipzig, Germany, 1880)\n| author = [[Ivan Turgenev]]\n| country = Russia\n| language = Russian\n| genre = Political, [[Romanticism|romance]], philosophical\n| publisher = ''[[The Russian Messenger]]''\n| release_date = February 1862\n| media_type = Hardback and paperback\n| pages = 226 pp (2001 Modern Library Paperback Edition)\n| preceded_by = [[On the Eve]]\n| followed_by = [[Smoke (novel)|Smoke]]\n}}\n\n'''''Fathers and Sons''''' ({{lang-ru|\u00ab\u041e\u0442\u0446\u044b \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438\u00bb}}; ''Otcy i deti'', {{IPA-ru|\u0250\u02c8ts\u0268 i \u02c8d\u02b2et\u02b2i|IPA}}; archaic spelling \u041e\u0442\u0446\u044b \u0438 \u0434\u0463\u0442\u0438), also translated more literally as '''''Fathers and Children''''', is an 1862 [[novel]] by [[Ivan Turgenev]], published in [[Moscow]] by Grachev & Co.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.115.html/2017/medieval-renaissance-manuscripts-continental-books-l17403 |title= Manuscript|date= 2017|website=www.sothebys.com}}</ref> It is one of the most acclaimed Russian novels of the 19th century.\n\n==Plot==\nArkady Kirsanov has just graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg State University|University of Petersburg]] and returns with a friend, Bazarov, to his father's modest estate in an outlying province of Russia. His father, Nikolay, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, called Marino, but Nikolay's brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called \"[[Nihilist movement|nihilism]]\" which the young men, especially Bazarov, advocate.\n\nNikolay, initially delighted to have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy, and a certain awkwardness in his regard, as it emerges that Arkady's views, much influenced by Bazarov, are radical and make his own beliefs feel dated. Nikolay has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolay's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house to live with him and has already had a son by her, named Mitya. Arkady, however, is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother.\n\nThe two young men stay over at Marino for some weeks, then decide to visit a relative of Arkady's in a neighboring province. There, they observe the local gentry and meet Madame Anna Sergevna Odintsova, an elegant woman of independent means, who cuts a seductively different figure from the pretentious or humdrum types of her surrounding provincial society of gentry. Both are attracted to her, and she, intrigued by Bazarov's singular manner, invites them to spend a few days at her estate, Nikolskoye. While Bazarov at first feels nothing for Anna, Arkady falls head over heels in love with her. \n\nAt Nikolskoye, they also meet Katya, Anna Sergevna's sister. Although they remain for only a short period, both characters undergo significant change: their relationship with each other is especially affected, as Arkady has begun to find himself and drift from the position of Bazarov's follower. Bazarov, in particular, finds falling in love distressing because it runs against his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Odintsova's own cautious expressions of attraction to him, he announces that he loves her. She does not respond overtly to his declaration, though she too is deeply drawn to Bazarov while finding his dismissal of feelings and the aesthetic side of existence troublesome. While Anna does have some feelings toward Bazarov, they are not akin toward love and Anna cannot open herself to him because she does not see the possibility of a good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents' home, and Arkady decides to accompany him.\n\nAt Bazarov's home, they are received enthusiastically by his parents, and the traditional mores of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as he speaks to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn, reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke about fighting over Bazarov's [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]]. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Marino, stopping on the way to see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home.\n\nArkady remains for only a few days and makes an excuse to leave in order to go to Nikolskoye again. Once there, he realizes he is not in love with Odintsova, but instead with her sister Katya. Bazarov stays at Marino to do some scientific research, and tension between him and Pavel increases. Bazarov enjoys talking with Fenechka and playing with her child, and one day he kisses her, against her will. Pavel observes this kiss and, secretly in love with Fenechka himself and in protection of both Fenechka and Nikolay's feelings for her, challenges Bazarov to a duel. Pavel is wounded in the leg, and Bazarov must leave Marino. He stops for an hour or so at Madame Odintsova's, then continues on to his parents' home. Meanwhile, Arkady and Katya have fallen in love and have become engaged. Anna Sergevna Odinstova is hesitant to accept Arkady's request to marry her sister, but Bazarov convinces her to allow the marriage. \n\nWhile back at home, Bazarov changes quite drastically. Instead of focusing on his experiments he turns to help his father in being a country doctor. At home, Bazarov cannot keep his mind on his work and while performing an autopsy fails to take the proper precautions. He cuts himself and contracts [[septicemia|blood poisoning]]. On his deathbed, he sends for Madame Odintsova, who arrives just in time to hear Bazarov tell her how beautiful she is. She kisses him on the forehead and leaves; Bazarov dies from his illness the following day.\n\nArkady marries Katya and takes over the management of his father's estate. His father marries Fenechka and is delighted to have Arkady home with him. Pavel leaves the country and lives the rest of his life as a \"noble\" in Dresden, Germany.\n\n==Major characters==\nIn order of appearance<br>\n\n''Chapter 1''\n{{quote box\n | align    = right | width    = 33% | border   = 2px | fontsize = 90% | bgcolor  = #CCDDFF\n | quote = The country through which they were driving was not in the least picturesque. ...

Both the nihilists (the \"sons\") and the 1830s liberals (the \"fathers\") sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the [[Slavophile]]s, who believed that Russia's path lay in its traditional spirituality.\n\nTurgenev's novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term [[Nihilist movement|nihilism]], which became widely used after the novel was published.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nihilismus|url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/05/0510_Nihilismus.pdf|publisher=Johannes Kepler University|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Fathers and Sons'' might be regarded as the first wholly modern novel in [[Russian literature]] ([[Gogol]]'s ''[[Dead Souls]]'', another main contender, was referred to by the author as a poem or epic in prose as in the style of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', and was at any rate never completed).

FIVER officially cancelled Sofia's Diary on 12 June 2009, saying they had no broadcast right to new episodes and their contract had expired, they also said they had no intention to renew it. The show has now ended on [[Bebo]] as well.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Actor\n!

The group, which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after [[Carlo Gambino]], boss of the family at the time of the [[Valachi hearings|McClellan hearings]] in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction [[racketeering]], gambling, [[loansharking]], [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], prostitution,<ref name=\"abclocal1\">{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/investigators&id=6011150 |title=Emperor's Club: The Investigators look at the web site behind the Spitzer scandal |publisher=ABC News |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref> fraud, hijacking, and [[Fence (criminal)|fencing]].\n\nThe family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the [[Castellammarese War]] of 1931. For most of the next quarter-century, it was a minor player in organized crime. Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss [[Albert Anastasia]], who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld's enforcement arm, [[Murder, Inc.]] He remained in power even after Murder, Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s, and took over his family in 1951\u2014by all accounts, after murdering the family's founder [[Vincent Mangano]]\u2014which was then recognized as the '''Mangano crime family'''.\n\nThe rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957, when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. Experts believe that Anastasia's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family. Gambino partnered with [[Meyer Lansky]] to control gambling interests in Cuba. The family's fortunes grew through 1976, when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law [[Paul Castellano]] as boss upon his death. Castellano infuriated upstart capo [[John Gotti]], who orchestrated Castellano's murder in 1985. Gotti's downfall came in 1992, when his underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy Bull\" Gravano]] decided to cooperate with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Gravano's cooperation brought down Gotti, along with most of the top members of the Gambino family. Beginning in 2015, the family was headed by [[Frank Cali]] until his assassination outside his Staten Island home on March 13, 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n====D'Aquila gang====\nThe origins of the Gambino crime family can be traced back to the faction of newly transplanted mafiosi from [[Palermo, Sicily]] who were originally led by [[Ignazio Lupo]]. When he and his partner by business and marriage, [[Giuseppe Morello]], were sent to prison for counterfeiting in 1910, [[Salvatore D'Aquila|Salvatore \"Toto\" D'Aquila]], one of Lupo's chief captains, took over. D'Aquila was an influential emigrant from Palermo who joined the Lupo gang based in [[Italian Harlem|East Harlem]]. Founded in the 1900s, the Lupo ''[[Black Hand (extortion)|Mano Nera]]'' gang was one of the first Italian criminal groups in New York.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |title=Informer, May 2014 Issue |url=http://informer-journal.blogspot.com/2014/05/may-2014-issue-of-informer.html |website=Informer |accessdate=March 3, 2016|date=May 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=sifakis/> Lupo was partner in many ventures with Morello, who was the original ''[[capo di tutti capi]]'' (boss of bosses), a title that would later be coveted by D'Aquila.

With the Morello family weakened, D'Aquila used the opportunity to establish the dominance of what was now his own Palermitani family in East Harlem. D'Aquila quickly used his ties to other Mafia leaders in the United States to create a network of influence and connections and was soon a powerful force in New York.<ref name=critchley />\n\n====New York gangs====\nBy 1910, more Italian gangs had formed in New York City. In addition to the original Morello gang in East Harlem and D'Aquila's own, now growing gang, also in East Harlem (but expanding into Little Italy in Manhattan's Lower East Side), there were other organizations forming. In [[Brooklyn]], [[Nicolo Schir\u00f2|Nicolo \"Cola\" Schir\u00f2]] established a second gang of Sicilian mafiosi from [[Castellammare del Golfo]], west of Palermo, in Sicily. A third Sicilian gang was formed by [[Alfred Mineo]] in Brooklyn.<ref name=\"dash 246\">{{cite book|last=Dash|first= Mike |page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FfxoHNZr4K4C&pg=PP25&dq=%22Alessandro+Vollero#v=snippet&q=Cola&f=false |title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2009 |isbn= 9780307372307}}</ref> Another Morello captain, [[Gaetano Reina]], had also broken away in the Bronx, ruling that area with impunity. In south Brooklyn, first [[Johnny Torrio]], then [[Frankie Yale]] were leading a new and rising organization. Finally, there were two allied Neapolitan [[Camorra in New York|Camorra]] gangs, one on [[Coney Island]] and one on Navy Street in Brooklyn, that were run by [[Pellegrino Morano]] and [[Alessandro Vollero]].<ref name=Dash>{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=[Toronto]|isbn=978-0-385-66751-7|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FfxoHNZr4K4C&pg=PP25&dq=%22Alessandro+Vollero#v=onepage&q=%22Alessandro%20Vollero&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916 the Camorra had assassinated [[Nicholas Morello]], head of the Morello gang. In response, D'Aquila allied with the Morellos to fight the Camorra. In 1917, both Morano and Vollero were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. With their leadership gone, the two Camorra gangs disappeared and D'Aquila and the Schiro family in Brooklyn took over many of their rackets in Brooklyn.<ref name=\"dash 262\">{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike |title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia |page=262|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FfxoHNZr4K4C&pg=PP25&dq=%22Alessandro+Vollero#v=onepage&q=%22Alessandro%20Vollero&f=false |isbn=9780307372307|date=August 4, 2009 }}</ref> Soon after, D'Aquila absorbed the Mineo gang, making Mineo his first lieutenant. D'Aquila now controlled the largest and most influential Italian gang in New York City. It was about this time that [[Joe Masseria]], another former Morello captain, began asserting his influence over the Lower East Side's Little Italy and began to come into conflict with D'Aquila's operations there, as Prohibition approached.\n\n====Prohibition====\nIn 1920, the United States outlawed the production and sale of alcoholic beverages ([[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]), creating the opportunity for an extremely lucrative illegal racket for the New York gangs.\n\nBy 1920, D'Aquila's only significant rival was [[Giuseppe Masseria|Giuseppe \"Joe the Boss\" Masseria]]. Masseria had taken over the Morello family interests, and by the mid-1920s, had begun to amass power and influence to rival that of D'Aquila. By the late 1920s, D'Aquila and Masseria were headed for a showdown.\n\nOn October 10, 1928, Masseria gunmen assassinated Salvatore D'Aquila outside his home.<ref name=\"critchley 157\">Critchley, p. 157</ref> D'Aquila's second-in-command, [[Alfred Mineo]], and his right-hand man, [[Steve Ferrigno]], now commanded the largest and most influential Sicilian gang in New York City.\n\n====Castellammarese War====\nIn 1930, the [[Castellammarese War]] started between Masseria and [[Salvatore Maranzano]], the new leader of Cola Schir\u00f2's [[Bonanno crime family|Castellammarese gang]], for control of Italian-American organized crime in New York.<ref>Raab, p. 27</ref> Mineo was a casualty; he and Ferrigno were shot dead during an assassination attempt on Masseria on November 5, 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maas|first=Peter|title=The Valachi Papers|year=1968|publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York|isbn=0-671-63173-X|pages=64\u201365|edition=1986 Pocket Books}}</ref> In April 1931, Masseria was murdered in a restaurant by several of his gang members who had defected to Maranzano.<ref name=\"raab 29\">Raab, p. 29</ref> Maranzano declared himself the boss of all bosses and reorganized all the New York gangs into five crime families.

Mangano also received a seat on the new Commission.<ref>Bonanno, p. 141</ref> The modern era of the Cosa Nostra had begun.\n\n===Mangano era===\n[[Vincent Mangano]] now took over the family, with [[Joseph Biondo]] as consigliere and [[Albert Anastasia]] as underboss. Vincent Mangano still believed in the Old World mob traditions of \"honor\", \"tradition\", \"respect\" and \"dignity.\" However, he was somewhat more forward-looking than either Masseria and Maranzano. To compensate for loss of massive revenues with the end of Prohibition in 1933, Vincent Mangano moved his family into extortion, union racketeering, and illegal gambling operations including horse betting, running numbers and lotteries.\n\nVincent Mangano also established the City Democratic Club, ostensibly to promote American values. In reality, the Club was a cover for [[Murder, Inc.]], the notorious band of mainly Jewish hitmen who performed contract murders for the Cosa Nostra nationwide. Anastasia was the operating head of Murder, Inc.; he was popularly known as the \"Lord High Executioner\".\n\nVincent Mangano also had close ties with Emil Camarda, a vice-president of the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] (ILA). Through the ILA, Mangano and the family completely controlled the [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] waterfronts. From 1932 onward, the president of ILA Local 1814 was [[Anthony Anastasio|Anthony \"Tough Tony\" Anastasio]], Albert Anastasia's younger brother (Anthony kept the original spelling of their last name). Anastasio was one of the family's biggest earners, steering millions of dollars in kickbacks and payoffs into the family's coffers. Anastasio made no secret of his ties to the mob; he only had to say \"my brother Albert\" to get his point across. With the family's backing, the Brooklyn waterfront was Anastasio's bailiwick for 30 years.\n\nAround this time, [[Carlo Gambino]] was promoted within the Mangano family, along with another future boss, Gambino's cousin [[Paul Castellano]].<ref name=\"crimelibrary1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/2.html |title=The Gambino Crime Family - Crime Library on truTV.com |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420125455/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/2.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAnastasia and Mangano were usually in conflict, even though they worked together for 20 years. On numerous occasions, Anastasia and Vincent Mangano came close to physical conflict. Vincent Mangano felt uncomfortable with Anastasia's close ties to [[Lucky Luciano]], [[Frank Costello]], [[Joseph Bonanno]] and other top mobsters outside his family. Mangano was also jealous of Anastasia's strong power base in Murder Inc. and the waterfront unions. In April 1951, Vincent Mangano disappeared without a trace, while his brother Phillip was found dead.<ref name=\"shot dead\">{{cite news|title=Aide of Joe Adonis is Found Shot Dead |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/04/20/87242113.pdf |accessdate=February 26, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 1951}}</ref> No one was ever charged in the Mangano brothers' deaths and Vincent's body was never found. However, it is generally believed that Anastasia murdered both of them.\n\n===Anastasia regime===\nCalled to face [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]], Anastasia refused to accept guilt for the Mangano murders. However, Anastasia did claim that [[Vincent Mangano]] had been planning to kill him. Anastasia was already running the family in Vincent Mangano's \"absence\" and the Commission members were intimidated by Anastasia. With the support of [[Frank Costello]], boss of the [[Genovese crime family|Luciano crime family]], the Commission confirmed Anastasia's ascension as boss of what was now the Anastasia crime family. [[Carlo Gambino]], a wily character with designs on the leadership himself, maneuvered himself into the position of consigliere.<ref name=\"crimelibrary1\" />\n\nThe former boss of [[Murder, Inc.]], Anastasia was a vicious murderer who inspired fear throughout the New York families. With Costello as an ally, Anastasia came to control the Commission. Costello's bitter rival was [[Vito Genovese]], a former underboss for [[Lucky Luciano]]. Since 1946, Genovese had been scheming to remove Costello from power but was not powerful enough to face Anastasia.\n\n====Plot against Anastasia====\nAnastasia's own brutal actions soon created a favorable climate in New York for his removal. In 1952, Anastasia ordered the murder of a Brooklyn man [[Arnold Schuster]] who had aided in the capture of the bank robber (Willie Sutton). Anastasia did not like the fact that Schuster had helped the police. The New York families were outraged by this gratuitous killing that raised a large amount of public furor.<ref name=\"willie sutton\">{{cite news|last=Duffy|first=Peter|title=CITY LORE; Willie Sutton, Urbane Scoundrel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/17/nyregion/city-lore-willie-sutton-urbane-scoundrel.html?scp=4&sq=&pagewanted=1 |accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 17, 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"valachi data\">{{cite news|last=Bigart|first=Homer|title=Police Deride Valachi Data as Stale Rumor and Gossip|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/10/03/89964170.pdf|accessdate=December 30, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 3, 1963}}</ref> Anastasia also alienated one of Luciano's powerful associates, [[Meyer Lansky]], by opening [[casino]]s in [[Cuba]] to compete with Lansky's.

Gotti was ambitious and wanted to be boss himself. Gotti rapidly became dissatisfied with Castellano's leadership, regarding the new boss as being too isolated and greedy.<ref>Davis, p. 187</ref><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 61</ref> Like other members of the family, Gotti also personally disliked Castellano. The boss lacked [[street cred]]ibility, and those who had paid their dues running street level jobs did not respect him. Gotti also had an economic interest: he had a running beef with Castellano on the split Gotti took from hijackings at Kennedy Airport. Gotti was also rumored to be expanding into [[drug dealing]], a lucrative trade Castellano had banned.\n\nIn August 1983, Ruggiero and Gene Gotti were arrested for dealing [[heroin]], based primarily on recordings from a [[Covert listening device|bug]] in Ruggiero's house.<ref name=\"Davis, p 216\">Davis, p. 216</ref><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 77</ref> Castellano, who had banned made men from his family from dealing drugs under threat of death, demanded transcripts of the tapes,<ref name=\"Davis, p 216\"/><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), pp. 79\u201380</ref> and, when Ruggiero refused, threatened to demote Gotti.<ref name=\"Davis, p 238\">Davis, p 238</ref>\n\nIt has long been a rule in the Mafia that killing a boss is forbidden without the support of a majority of the Commission. Indeed, Gotti's planned hit would have been the first attack on a boss since [[Frank Costello]] was nearly killed in 1957. Gotti knew that it would be too risky to solicit support from the other four bosses, since they had longstanding ties to Castellano. To get around this, he got the support of several important figures of his generation in the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]], [[Colombo crime family|Colombo]] and [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno families]]. He did not consider approaching the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese family]] as Castellano had close ties with Genovese boss [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"Chin\" Gigante]].<ref name=\"Raab, p. 375\"/> However, Gotti could also count on the complicity of Gambino ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Joseph N. Gallo]].<ref name=\"RnF 92\"/><ref>Maas, p. 315</ref>\n\nAfter Dellacroce died of cancer on December 2, 1985, Castellano revised his succession plan: appointing Bilotti as underboss to Thomas Gambino as the sole acting boss, while making plans to break up Gotti's crew.<ref name=\"Davis 263\">Davis, pp. 263\u2013266</ref><ref name=\"RnF 97\">Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 97</ref> Infuriated by this, and Castellano's refusal to attend Dellacroce's [[wake (ceremony)|wake]],<ref name=\"Davis 263\"/><ref name=\"RnF 97\"/> Gotti resolved to kill his boss.\n\nWhen DeCicco tipped Gotti off that he would be having a meeting with Castellano and several other Gambino mobsters at [[Sparks Steak House]] on December 16, 1985, Gotti chose to take the opportunity.<ref>Maas, pp. 321\u2013322</ref> The evening of the meeting, when the boss and underboss arrived, they were ambushed and shot dead by assassins under Gotti's command.<ref>Davis, pp. 272\u2013273</ref> Gotti watched the hit from his car with Gravano.<ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), pp. 102\u2013104</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 1985, Bilotti and Castellano arrived at [[Sparks Steak House]] in Manhattan for a dinner meeting with capo [[Frank DeCicco]].

It was also announced that an internal investigation into Castellano's murder was underway. However, it was an open secret that Gotti was acting boss in all but name, and nearly all of the family's ''capos'' knew he had been the one behind the hit. He was formally acclaimed as the new boss of the Gambino family at a meeting of 20 ''capos'' held on January 15, 1986.<ref>Raab, p. 377-378.</ref> Gotti appointed [[Frank DeCicco]] as underboss and promoted [[Angelo Ruggiero]] and [[Sammy Gravano]] to capo.<ref>Davis, p. 282</ref><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 115</ref> Gotti was known as \"The Dapper Don\", renowned for his hand-tailored suits and silk ties. Unlike his colleagues, Gotti made little effort to hide his mob connections and was very willing to provide interesting [[sound bite]]s to the media. His home in [[Howard Beach, Queens]] was frequently seen on television. He liked to hold meetings with family members while walking in public places so that law enforcement agents could not record the conversations. One of Gotti's neighbors in Howard Beach was [[Joseph Massino]], underboss of the [[Bonanno crime family]]. Gotti and Massino had a longstanding friendship dating back to the 1970s when they were known as two of the most proficient truck hijackers in New York.\n\nMob leaders from the other families were enraged at the Castellano murder and disapproved of Gotti's high-profile style. Gotti's strongest enemy was [[Genovese crime family]] boss [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"Chin\" Gigante]], a former Castellano ally. Gigante conspired with Lucchese boss [[Anthony Corallo|Anthony \"Tony Ducks\" Corallo]] to have Gotti killed. Corallo gave the contract to two top members of his family, [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]].\n\nGotti's newfound fame had at least one positive effect; upon the revelation of his attacker's occupation, and amid reports of intimidation by the Gambinos, Romual Piecyk decided not to testify against Gotti thanks to [[Bo\u0161ko Radonji\u0107|Bo\u0161ko \"The Yugo\" Radonji\u0107]], the head of the [[Westies]] in [[Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]].

Born in Palermo in 1947. He became involved through the drug trade. Not much is known about Cefal\u00f9 due to his deliberate \"low-key\" presence other than his 1982 heroin trafficking sentence; he served 6 years. He was inducted by [[John Gotti]] in 1991. In 1992 and 1993, he refused to testify against [[Pasquale Conte]] and was given an 18-month imprisonment; released in February 1994. Around 1995 or 1996, he was sentenced to 33 months for criminal contempt. In the mid-2000s, [[Jackie D'Amico]] promoted Cefal\u00f9 as acting underboss, until his succession of boss in 2011.\n* '''Underboss''' Lorenzo Mannino - suspected of being part of the top administration since a few years ago, at least regarded as a former respected and powerful captain in Brooklyn. Mannino was implicated by [[Sammy Gravano]] in the 1988 killing of Francesco Oliveri. He was formerly part of the \"Sicilian faction\" and also an acquaintance of [[John Gambino]]. In 1994, he was sentenced to 15 years and fined $25,000 for drug trafficking & racketeering.\n* '''Consigliere''' Michael \"Mickey boy\" Paradiso \u2013 reportedly promoted in 2019. He has been active since the 1960s. In the 1970s, he assaulted [[John Gotti]] and was appointed as [[Caporegime|captain]] by Gotti in the mid-1980s. Paradiso has been suspected of hiring Jimmy Hydell and two other associates in the failed September 1985 murder of [[Lucchese crime family]] underboss [[Anthony Casso]]. By 1986, he completed his 8-year sentence of the hijacking of two trailer-trucks containing 500 bags of Colombian coffee and was released on $500,000 bail, when he was convicted of operating a major heroin-distribution network at [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg|Lewisburg Penitentiary]]. It has been alleged Gotti ordered a contract on his life around late 1987 as retribution for Casso. In 1989, he was acquitted of murder after his own brother accused him of committing a January 1978 murder among 9 others. He was paroled in 1998, returned to prison in 1999 on a parole violation then released in 2000. Paradiso was released in 2011 for an unknown crime. In 2016, he and 21 other members and associates of the Gambino, [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]] and [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]] crime families were indicted as part of an illegal gambling and $15&nbsp;million [[marijuana]] and [[oxycodone]] drug operation which stretched from California to New York.\n\n==Current family capos==\nDuring the 1980s and 90s, the Gambino crime family had 24 active crews operating in New York City, New Jersey, Long Island, South Florida, and Connecticut. By 2000, the family had approximately 20 crews. However, according to a 2004 New Jersey Organized Crime Report, the Gambino family had only ten active crews.<ref name=\"state.nj.us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/ocreport.pdf |title=Waste And Abuse |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===New York===\n\n====Brooklyn/Staten Island faction====\n*[[Frank Camuso]] \u2013 Capo of a Staten Island crew.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aboutthemafia.com/bonnano-family-consigliere-john-porky-zancocchio-one-upped-the-feds-over-prison-food|title=Bonnano family consigliere John 'Porky' Zancocchio one-upped the feds over prison food|date=2018-08-01|website=About The Mafia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref>\n*[[Dominick \"Big D\" Cefal\u00f9]] \u2013 Capo of a Brooklyn crew, and first cousin to boss Domenico Cefal\u00f9.\n* [[Joseph Juliano|Joseph \"Sonny\" Juliano]]&nbsp;\u2013 Capo of a Brooklyn crew that operates illegal gambling, loansharking, fraud and wire fraud activities.

At that time, Gambino was Anastasia's new underboss and Vito Genovese was the underboss for Costello. Their first target was Costello on May 2, 1957. Costello survived the assassination attempt, but immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of Genovese. Their second target was Anastasia on October 25, 1957. The Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia in a Manhattan barber shop, opening the war for Gambino to become the new boss of the now-Gambino crime family. After assuming power, Gambino started conspiring with Lucchese to remove their former ally Genovese. In 1959, with the assistance of [[Lucky Luciano]], Costello, and [[Meyer Lansky]], Genovese was arrested and Gambino assumed full control with Lucchese of the Mafia Commission. Under Gambino and Lucchese, the Commission pushed Bonanno boss [[Joseph Bonanno]] out of power, triggering an internal war in that family. In the 1960s, the Commission backed the Gallo brothers in their rebellion against Profaci family boss [[Joe Profaci]]. In 1962, Gambino's oldest son [[Thomas Gambino|Thomas]] married Lucchese's daughter, strengthening the Gambino and Luchese family alliance. Lucchese gave Gambino access into the New York airports rackets he controlled, and Gambino allowed Lucchese into some of their rackets. After Lucchese death in July 1967, Gambino used his power over the Commission to appoint [[Carmine Tramunti]] as the new Luchese family leader. Gambino later continued the alliance with Tramunti's successor, [[Anthony Corallo]]. After Gambino's death, new Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] continued the Luchese alliance. In 1985, the original Gambino-Luchese alliance dissolved when [[John Gotti]] ordered Castellano's assassination and took power in the Gambino family without Commission approval.\n\n===The Gambino-Lucchese===\n(1999\u2013present) was initiated by acting Luchese boss [[Steven Crea]] in 1999.

One mafia expert was surprised that the two groups would cooperate because the American Cosa Nostra was affiliated with the rivals of the Corleonesi. But another expert said the joint effort was understandable. \"It may be that the Gambinos at a certain point recognised that the Corleonesi had been victorious in the war between rival families in Sicily  ... there is nothing unusual in the traffic of personnel and ideas across the Atlantic ... they were cousin organisations,\" according to John Dickie, professor of Italian studies at University College London and the author of ''Mafia Republic \u2013 Italy's Criminal Curse''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/05/22/american-mafia-sent-explosives-expert-help-sicilian-mob-assassinate/|title=American mafia 'sent explosives expert' to help Sicilian mob assassinate crusading investigator|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=22 May 2019|access-date=22 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Government informants and witnesses==\n* '''[[Alphonse Attardi|Alphonso \"The Peacemaker\" Attardi]]''' - the first confirmed Gambino crime family informant.

The group, which went through five bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after [[Carlo Gambino]], boss of the family at the time of the [[Valachi hearings|McClellan hearings]] in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction [[racketeering]], gambling, [[loansharking]], [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], prostitution,<ref name=\"abclocal1\">{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/investigators&id=6011150 |title=Emperor's Club: The Investigators look at the web site behind the Spitzer scandal |publisher=ABC News |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref> fraud, hijacking, and [[Fence (criminal)|fencing]].\n\nThe family was one of the five families that were founded in New York after the [[Castellammarese War]] of 1931. For most of the next quarter-century, it was a minor player in organized crime. Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss [[Albert Anastasia]], who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld's enforcement arm, [[Murder, Inc.]] He remained in power even after Murder, Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s, and took over his family in 1951\u2014by all accounts, after murdering the family's founder [[Vincent Mangano]]\u2014which was then recognized as the '''Mangano crime family'''.\n\nThe rise of what was the most powerful crime family in America for a time began in 1957, when Anastasia was assassinated while sitting in a barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel in Manhattan. Experts believe that Anastasia's underboss Carlo Gambino helped orchestrate the hit to take over the family. Gambino partnered with [[Meyer Lansky]] to control gambling interests in Cuba. The family's fortunes grew through 1976, when Gambino appointed his brother-in-law [[Paul Castellano]] as boss upon his death. Castellano infuriated upstart capo [[John Gotti]], who orchestrated Castellano's murder in 1985. Gotti's downfall came in 1992, when his underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy Bull\" Gravano]] decided to cooperate with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Gravano's cooperation brought down Gotti, along with most of the top members of the Gambino family. Beginning in 2015, the family was headed by [[Frank Cali]] until his assassination outside his Staten Island home on March 13, 2019.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n====D'Aquila gang====\nThe origins of the Gambino crime family can be traced back to the faction of newly transplanted mafiosi from [[Palermo, Sicily]] who were originally led by [[Ignazio Lupo]]. When he and his partner by business and marriage, [[Giuseppe Morello]], were sent to prison for counterfeiting in 1910, [[Salvatore D'Aquila|Salvatore \"Toto\" D'Aquila]], one of Lupo's chief captains, took over. D'Aquila was an influential emigrant from Palermo who joined the Lupo gang based in [[Italian Harlem|East Harlem]]. Founded in the 1900s, the Lupo ''[[Black Hand (extortion)|Mano Nera]]'' gang was one of the first Italian criminal groups in New York.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |title=Informer, May 2014 Issue |url=http://informer-journal.blogspot.com/2014/05/may-2014-issue-of-informer.html |website=Informer |accessdate=March 3, 2016|date=May 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=sifakis/> Lupo was partner in many ventures with Morello, who was the original ''[[capo di tutti capi]]'' (boss of bosses), a title that would later be coveted by D'Aquila.

With the Morello family weakened, D'Aquila used the opportunity to establish the dominance of what was now his own Palermitani family in East Harlem. D'Aquila quickly used his ties to other Mafia leaders in the United States to create a network of influence and connections and was soon a powerful force in New York.<ref name=critchley />\n\n====New York gangs====\nBy 1910, more Italian gangs had formed in New York City. In addition to the original Morello gang in East Harlem and D'Aquila's own, now growing gang, also in East Harlem (but expanding into Little Italy in Manhattan's Lower East Side), there were other organizations forming. In [[Brooklyn]], [[Nicolo Schir\u00f2|Nicolo \"Cola\" Schir\u00f2]] established a second gang of Sicilian mafiosi from [[Castellammare del Golfo]], west of Palermo, in Sicily. A third Sicilian gang was formed by [[Alfred Mineo]] in Brooklyn.<ref name=\"dash 246\">{{cite book|last=Dash|first= Mike |page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FfxoHNZr4K4C&pg=PP25&dq=%22Alessandro+Vollero#v=snippet&q=Cola&f=false |title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2009 |isbn= 9780307372307}}</ref> Another Morello captain, [[Gaetano Reina]], had also broken away in the Bronx, ruling that area with impunity. In south Brooklyn, first [[Johnny Torrio]], then [[Frankie Yale]] were leading a new and rising organization. Finally, there were two allied Neapolitan [[Camorra in New York|Camorra]] gangs, one on [[Coney Island]] and one on Navy Street in Brooklyn, that were run by [[Pellegrino Morano]] and [[Alessandro Vollero]].<ref name=Dash>{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=[Toronto]|isbn=978-0-385-66751-7|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FfxoHNZr4K4C&pg=PP25&dq=%22Alessandro+Vollero#v=onepage&q=%22Alessandro%20Vollero&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916 the Camorra had assassinated [[Nicholas Morello]], head of the Morello gang. In response, D'Aquila allied with the Morellos to fight the Camorra. In 1917, both Morano and Vollero were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. With their leadership gone, the two Camorra gangs disappeared and D'Aquila and the Schiro family in Brooklyn took over many of their rackets in Brooklyn.<ref name=\"dash 262\">{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike |title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia |page=262|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FfxoHNZr4K4C&pg=PP25&dq=%22Alessandro+Vollero#v=onepage&q=%22Alessandro%20Vollero&f=false |isbn=9780307372307|date=August 4, 2009 }}</ref> Soon after, D'Aquila absorbed the Mineo gang, making Mineo his first lieutenant. D'Aquila now controlled the largest and most influential Italian gang in New York City. It was about this time that [[Joe Masseria]], another former Morello captain, began asserting his influence over the Lower East Side's Little Italy and began to come into conflict with D'Aquila's operations there, as Prohibition approached.\n\n====Prohibition====\nIn 1920, the United States outlawed the production and sale of alcoholic beverages ([[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]), creating the opportunity for an extremely lucrative illegal racket for the New York gangs.\n\nBy 1920, D'Aquila's only significant rival was [[Giuseppe Masseria|Giuseppe \"Joe the Boss\" Masseria]]. Masseria had taken over the Morello family interests, and by the mid-1920s, had begun to amass power and influence to rival that of D'Aquila. By the late 1920s, D'Aquila and Masseria were headed for a showdown.\n\nOn October 10, 1928, Masseria gunmen assassinated Salvatore D'Aquila outside his home.<ref name=\"critchley 157\">Critchley, p. 157</ref> D'Aquila's second-in-command, [[Alfred Mineo]], and his right-hand man, [[Steve Ferrigno]], now commanded the largest and most influential Sicilian gang in New York City.\n\n====Castellammarese War====\nIn 1930, the [[Castellammarese War]] started between Masseria and [[Salvatore Maranzano]], the new leader of Cola Schir\u00f2's [[Bonanno crime family|Castellammarese gang]], for control of Italian-American organized crime in New York.<ref>Raab, p. 27</ref> Mineo was a casualty; he and Ferrigno were shot dead during an assassination attempt on Masseria on November 5, 1930.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maas|first=Peter|title=The Valachi Papers|year=1968|publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York|isbn=0-671-63173-X|pages=64\u201365|edition=1986 Pocket Books}}</ref> In April 1931, Masseria was murdered in a restaurant by several of his gang members who had defected to Maranzano.<ref name=\"raab 29\">Raab, p. 29</ref> Maranzano declared himself the boss of all bosses and reorganized all the New York gangs into five crime families.

Mangano also received a seat on the new Commission.<ref>Bonanno, p. 141</ref> The modern era of the Cosa Nostra had begun.\n\n===Mangano era===\n[[Vincent Mangano]] now took over the family, with [[Joseph Biondo]] as consigliere and [[Albert Anastasia]] as underboss. Vincent Mangano still believed in the Old World mob traditions of \"honor\", \"tradition\", \"respect\" and \"dignity.\" However, he was somewhat more forward-looking than either Masseria and Maranzano. To compensate for loss of massive revenues with the end of Prohibition in 1933, Vincent Mangano moved his family into extortion, union racketeering, and illegal gambling operations including horse betting, running numbers and lotteries.\n\nVincent Mangano also established the City Democratic Club, ostensibly to promote American values. In reality, the Club was a cover for [[Murder, Inc.]], the notorious band of mainly Jewish hitmen who performed contract murders for the Cosa Nostra nationwide. Anastasia was the operating head of Murder, Inc.; he was popularly known as the \"Lord High Executioner\".\n\nVincent Mangano also had close ties with Emil Camarda, a vice-president of the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] (ILA). Through the ILA, Mangano and the family completely controlled the [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]] waterfronts. From 1932 onward, the president of ILA Local 1814 was [[Anthony Anastasio|Anthony \"Tough Tony\" Anastasio]], Albert Anastasia's younger brother (Anthony kept the original spelling of their last name). Anastasio was one of the family's biggest earners, steering millions of dollars in kickbacks and payoffs into the family's coffers. Anastasio made no secret of his ties to the mob; he only had to say \"my brother Albert\" to get his point across. With the family's backing, the Brooklyn waterfront was Anastasio's bailiwick for 30 years.\n\nAround this time, [[Carlo Gambino]] was promoted within the Mangano family, along with another future boss, Gambino's cousin [[Paul Castellano]].<ref name=\"crimelibrary1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/2.html |title=The Gambino Crime Family - Crime Library on truTV.com |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420125455/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/gambino/2.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAnastasia and Mangano were usually in conflict, even though they worked together for 20 years. On numerous occasions, Anastasia and Vincent Mangano came close to physical conflict. Vincent Mangano felt uncomfortable with Anastasia's close ties to [[Lucky Luciano]], [[Frank Costello]], [[Joseph Bonanno]] and other top mobsters outside his family. Mangano was also jealous of Anastasia's strong power base in Murder Inc. and the waterfront unions. In April 1951, Vincent Mangano disappeared without a trace, while his brother Phillip was found dead.<ref name=\"shot dead\">{{cite news|title=Aide of Joe Adonis is Found Shot Dead |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1951/04/20/87242113.pdf |accessdate=February 26, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 1951}}</ref> No one was ever charged in the Mangano brothers' deaths and Vincent's body was never found. However, it is generally believed that Anastasia murdered both of them.\n\n===Anastasia regime===\nCalled to face [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]], Anastasia refused to accept guilt for the Mangano murders. However, Anastasia did claim that [[Vincent Mangano]] had been planning to kill him. Anastasia was already running the family in Vincent Mangano's \"absence\" and the Commission members were intimidated by Anastasia. With the support of [[Frank Costello]], boss of the [[Genovese crime family|Luciano crime family]], the Commission confirmed Anastasia's ascension as boss of what was now the Anastasia crime family. [[Carlo Gambino]], a wily character with designs on the leadership himself, maneuvered himself into the position of consigliere.<ref name=\"crimelibrary1\" />\n\nThe former boss of [[Murder, Inc.]], Anastasia was a vicious murderer who inspired fear throughout the New York families. With Costello as an ally, Anastasia came to control the Commission. Costello's bitter rival was [[Vito Genovese]], a former underboss for [[Lucky Luciano]]. Since 1946, Genovese had been scheming to remove Costello from power but was not powerful enough to face Anastasia.\n\n====Plot against Anastasia====\nAnastasia's own brutal actions soon created a favorable climate in New York for his removal. In 1952, Anastasia ordered the murder of a Brooklyn man [[Arnold Schuster]] who had aided in the capture of the bank robber (Willie Sutton). Anastasia did not like the fact that Schuster had helped the police. The New York families were outraged by this gratuitous killing that raised a large amount of public furor.<ref name=\"willie sutton\">{{cite news|last=Duffy|first=Peter|title=CITY LORE; Willie Sutton, Urbane Scoundrel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/17/nyregion/city-lore-willie-sutton-urbane-scoundrel.html?scp=4&sq=&pagewanted=1 |accessdate=December 30, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 17, 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"valachi data\">{{cite news|last=Bigart|first=Homer|title=Police Deride Valachi Data as Stale Rumor and Gossip|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/10/03/89964170.pdf|accessdate=December 30, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 3, 1963}}</ref> Anastasia also alienated one of Luciano's powerful associates, [[Meyer Lansky]], by opening [[casino]]s in [[Cuba]] to compete with Lansky's.

Gotti was ambitious and wanted to be boss himself. Gotti rapidly became dissatisfied with Castellano's leadership, regarding the new boss as being too isolated and greedy.<ref>Davis, p. 187</ref><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 61</ref> Like other members of the family, Gotti also personally disliked Castellano. The boss lacked [[street cred]]ibility, and those who had paid their dues running street level jobs did not respect him. Gotti also had an economic interest: he had a running beef with Castellano on the split Gotti took from hijackings at Kennedy Airport. Gotti was also rumored to be expanding into [[drug dealing]], a lucrative trade Castellano had banned.\n\nIn August 1983, Ruggiero and Gene Gotti were arrested for dealing [[heroin]], based primarily on recordings from a [[Covert listening device|bug]] in Ruggiero's house.<ref name=\"Davis, p 216\">Davis, p. 216</ref><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 77</ref> Castellano, who had banned made men from his family from dealing drugs under threat of death, demanded transcripts of the tapes,<ref name=\"Davis, p 216\"/><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), pp. 79\u201380</ref> and, when Ruggiero refused, threatened to demote Gotti.<ref name=\"Davis, p 238\">Davis, p 238</ref>\n\nIt has long been a rule in the Mafia that killing a boss is forbidden without the support of a majority of the Commission. Indeed, Gotti's planned hit would have been the first attack on a boss since [[Frank Costello]] was nearly killed in 1957. Gotti knew that it would be too risky to solicit support from the other four bosses, since they had longstanding ties to Castellano. To get around this, he got the support of several important figures of his generation in the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]], [[Colombo crime family|Colombo]] and [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno families]]. He did not consider approaching the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese family]] as Castellano had close ties with Genovese boss [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"Chin\" Gigante]].<ref name=\"Raab, p. 375\"/> However, Gotti could also count on the complicity of Gambino ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Joseph N. Gallo]].<ref name=\"RnF 92\"/><ref>Maas, p. 315</ref>\n\nAfter Dellacroce died of cancer on December 2, 1985, Castellano revised his succession plan: appointing Bilotti as underboss to Thomas Gambino as the sole acting boss, while making plans to break up Gotti's crew.<ref name=\"Davis 263\">Davis, pp. 263\u2013266</ref><ref name=\"RnF 97\">Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 97</ref> Infuriated by this, and Castellano's refusal to attend Dellacroce's [[wake (ceremony)|wake]],<ref name=\"Davis 263\"/><ref name=\"RnF 97\"/> Gotti resolved to kill his boss.\n\nWhen DeCicco tipped Gotti off that he would be having a meeting with Castellano and several other Gambino mobsters at [[Sparks Steak House]] on December 16, 1985, Gotti chose to take the opportunity.<ref>Maas, pp. 321\u2013322</ref> The evening of the meeting, when the boss and underboss arrived, they were ambushed and shot dead by assassins under Gotti's command.<ref>Davis, pp. 272\u2013273</ref> Gotti watched the hit from his car with Gravano.<ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), pp. 102\u2013104</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 1985, Bilotti and Castellano arrived at [[Sparks Steak House]] in Manhattan for a dinner meeting with capo [[Frank DeCicco]].

It was also announced that an internal investigation into Castellano's murder was underway. However, it was an open secret that Gotti was acting boss in all but name, and nearly all of the family's ''capos'' knew he had been the one behind the hit. He was formally acclaimed as the new boss of the Gambino family at a meeting of 20 ''capos'' held on January 15, 1986.<ref>Raab, p. 377-378.</ref> Gotti appointed [[Frank DeCicco]] as underboss and promoted [[Angelo Ruggiero]] and [[Sammy Gravano]] to capo.<ref>Davis, p. 282</ref><ref>Capeci, Mustain (1996), p. 115</ref> Gotti was known as \"The Dapper Don\", renowned for his hand-tailored suits and silk ties. Unlike his colleagues, Gotti made little effort to hide his mob connections and was very willing to provide interesting [[sound bite]]s to the media. His home in [[Howard Beach, Queens]] was frequently seen on television. He liked to hold meetings with family members while walking in public places so that law enforcement agents could not record the conversations. One of Gotti's neighbors in Howard Beach was [[Joseph Massino]], underboss of the [[Bonanno crime family]]. Gotti and Massino had a longstanding friendship dating back to the 1970s when they were known as two of the most proficient truck hijackers in New York.\n\nMob leaders from the other families were enraged at the Castellano murder and disapproved of Gotti's high-profile style. Gotti's strongest enemy was [[Genovese crime family]] boss [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"Chin\" Gigante]], a former Castellano ally. Gigante conspired with Lucchese boss [[Anthony Corallo|Anthony \"Tony Ducks\" Corallo]] to have Gotti killed. Corallo gave the contract to two top members of his family, [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]].\n\nGotti's newfound fame had at least one positive effect; upon the revelation of his attacker's occupation, and amid reports of intimidation by the Gambinos, Romual Piecyk decided not to testify against Gotti thanks to [[Bo\u0161ko Radonji\u0107|Bo\u0161ko \"The Yugo\" Radonji\u0107]], the head of the [[Westies]] in [[Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]].

Born in Palermo in 1947. He became involved through the drug trade. Not much is known about Cefal\u00f9 due to his deliberate \"low-key\" presence other than his 1982 heroin trafficking sentence; he served 6 years. He was inducted by [[John Gotti]] in 1991. In 1992 and 1993, he refused to testify against [[Pasquale Conte]] and was given an 18-month imprisonment; released in February 1994. Around 1995 or 1996, he was sentenced to 33 months for criminal contempt. In the mid-2000s, [[Jackie D'Amico]] promoted Cefal\u00f9 as acting underboss, until his succession of boss in 2011.\n* '''Underboss''' Lorenzo Mannino - suspected of being part of the top administration since a few years ago, at least regarded as a former respected and powerful captain in Brooklyn. Mannino was implicated by [[Sammy Gravano]] in the 1988 killing of Francesco Oliveri. He was formerly part of the \"Sicilian faction\" and also an acquaintance of [[John Gambino]]. In 1994, he was sentenced to 15 years and fined $25,000 for drug trafficking & racketeering.\n* '''Consigliere''' Michael \"Mickey boy\" Paradiso \u2013 reportedly promoted in 2019. He has been active since the 1960s. In the 1970s, he assaulted [[John Gotti]] and was appointed as [[Caporegime|captain]] by Gotti in the mid-1980s. Paradiso has been suspected of hiring Jimmy Hydell and two other associates in the failed September 1985 murder of [[Lucchese crime family]] underboss [[Anthony Casso]]. By 1986, he completed his 8-year sentence of the hijacking of two trailer-trucks containing 500 bags of Colombian coffee and was released on $500,000 bail, when he was convicted of operating a major heroin-distribution network at [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg|Lewisburg Penitentiary]]. It has been alleged Gotti ordered a contract on his life around late 1987 as retribution for Casso. In 1989, he was acquitted of murder after his own brother accused him of committing a January 1978 murder among 9 others. He was paroled in 1998, returned to prison in 1999 on a parole violation then released in 2000. Paradiso was released in 2011 for an unknown crime. In 2016, he and 21 other members and associates of the Gambino, [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]] and [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]] crime families were indicted as part of an illegal gambling and $15&nbsp;million [[marijuana]] and [[oxycodone]] drug operation which stretched from California to New York.\n\n==Current family capos==\nDuring the 1980s and 90s, the Gambino crime family had 24 active crews operating in New York City, New Jersey, Long Island, South Florida, and Connecticut. By 2000, the family had approximately 20 crews. However, according to a 2004 New Jersey Organized Crime Report, the Gambino family had only ten active crews.<ref name=\"state.nj.us\">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/sci/pdf/ocreport.pdf |title=Waste And Abuse |date= |accessdate=August 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===New York===\n\n====Brooklyn/Staten Island faction====\n*[[Frank Camuso]] \u2013 Capo of a Staten Island crew.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aboutthemafia.com/bonnano-family-consigliere-john-porky-zancocchio-one-upped-the-feds-over-prison-food|title=Bonnano family consigliere John 'Porky' Zancocchio one-upped the feds over prison food|date=2018-08-01|website=About The Mafia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref>\n*[[Dominick \"Big D\" Cefal\u00f9]] \u2013 Capo of a Brooklyn crew, and first cousin to boss Domenico Cefal\u00f9.\n* [[Joseph Juliano|Joseph \"Sonny\" Juliano]]&nbsp;\u2013 Capo of a Brooklyn crew that operates illegal gambling, loansharking, fraud and wire fraud activities.

At that time, Gambino was Anastasia's new underboss and Vito Genovese was the underboss for Costello. Their first target was Costello on May 2, 1957. Costello survived the assassination attempt, but immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of Genovese. Their second target was Anastasia on October 25, 1957. The Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia in a Manhattan barber shop, opening the war for Gambino to become the new boss of the now-Gambino crime family. After assuming power, Gambino started conspiring with Lucchese to remove their former ally Genovese. In 1959, with the assistance of [[Lucky Luciano]], Costello, and [[Meyer Lansky]], Genovese was arrested and Gambino assumed full control with Lucchese of the Mafia Commission. Under Gambino and Lucchese, the Commission pushed Bonanno boss [[Joseph Bonanno]] out of power, triggering an internal war in that family. In the 1960s, the Commission backed the Gallo brothers in their rebellion against Profaci family boss [[Joe Profaci]]. In 1962, Gambino's oldest son [[Thomas Gambino|Thomas]] married Lucchese's daughter, strengthening the Gambino and Luchese family alliance. Lucchese gave Gambino access into the New York airports rackets he controlled, and Gambino allowed Lucchese into some of their rackets. After Lucchese death in July 1967, Gambino used his power over the Commission to appoint [[Carmine Tramunti]] as the new Luchese family leader. Gambino later continued the alliance with Tramunti's successor, [[Anthony Corallo]]. After Gambino's death, new Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] continued the Luchese alliance.

In 1917, he legally changed his name to '''Eugenio L\u00e1scaris-Comneno''' (typically shortened to '''Eugenio L\u00e1scaris'''). As the supposed titular Byzantine emperor, Eugenio used the regnal name '''Eugene II Lascaris Comnenus'''.{{refn|There was no Byzantine emperor by the name Eugene. Lascorz's regnal number \"II\" derives from one of his invented ancestors \u2013 a supposed \"Eugenios Lascaris\" said to have lived in the 16th century.{{Sfn|New Byzantium||p=}}|group=\"n\"}} In addition to his royal and imperial claims, Lascorz also claimed the titles \"Prince [[Porphyrogenitus]]\", [[Duke of Athens]] and Grand Master of the [[Constantinian Order of Saint George]] and a self-proclaimed order, the \"Order of Saint Eugene of Trebizond\".'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}'''\n\nThough he practised law, Lascorz was also interested in history, especially that of Ancient Greece and Byzantium, and published several books, both fiction and non-fiction, exploring what he perceived to be the history of his ancestors. His life's work was his attempt to get his claims recognized and his desire to claim the throne of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] and restore the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Ancestry and early life ===\nEugenio Lascorz y Labastida was born in [[Zaragoza]] about 21:15 on 26 March 1886{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=41}} and as per Spanish naming customs, took the surnames of both his parents, Manuel Lascorz y Serveto (born in 1849) and Carmen Labastida y Paschal (born in 1857).{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} He was baptized two days after his birth in the parish church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (meaning \"[[Our Lady of the Pillar]]\"). His paternal grandparents were the laborer Victori\u00e1n Lascorz y Abad and Raimunda Serveto and his maternal grandparents were Manuel Labastida and Ramona Paschal.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=41}} His great-grandfather (the father of Victori\u00e1n) was a man by the name Alonso Lascorz y Cerdan.'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' The Lascorz family, and Eugenio's other ancestors, was of [[Basques|Basque]] (and not Greek) origin'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' and were likely part of a barrage of migrants who had arrived in Zaragoza in the third quarter of the 19th century.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=41}}\n\nThe Lascorz family was wealthy and Eugenio's father Manuel had studied law and the Latin language and he was an important man in Zaragoza, working as the secretary of the local [[Provincial deputation (Spain)|provincial deputation]].{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=42}} Manuel and Carmen had three children, Eugenio being the youngest. His older siblings were Lorenzo (1877\u20131900) and Josefina (1881\u20131956). Both Eugenio and Lorenzo studied at the [[University of Zaragoza]].{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=43}} Lorenzo studied medicine while Eugenio studied law. Tragically, Lorenzo died in 1900 at the age of just 22, and Eugenio became the \"heir\" to Manuel.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=44}} Eugenio began his professional career as an attorney in 1917.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} When exactly Lascorz began his Byzantine claims is unclear, later family tradition claims that his father \"revealed\" their family history on his deathbed on 5 August 1906, proclaiming to Eugenio and Josefina that he was not just Manuel Lascorz y Serveto, but Prince Alexios Manuel Lasc\u00e1ris-Comneno, who had arrived with his father Prince Andronikos in Spain after fleeing from Ottoman persecution.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=45}} Manuel's obituaries stated that he was a \"descendant and heir of the ancient Greek imperial family of the same surname, fleeing from the ruins of his homeland\".{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=49}}\n\n=== Byzantine claims and aspirations ===\nLascorz, possibly inspired by his father, believed that his last name was a corruption of ''[[Laskaris]]'', the name of a medieval Greek dynasty which had ruled the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]] from 1204 to 1261.'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' Explicitly proclaiming to restore the ancient glory of the Byzantine Empire, Lascorz was a proponent of the Greek [[Megali Idea]] (the Greek aspirations of conquering former Byzantine territory, including Constantinople, and restoring the borders of Byzantium).{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=51}} He embarked on a campaign of attempting to secure recognition of this descent through changing his legal identity by substituting \"Lascorz\" for \"L\u00e1scaris\" and seeking approval in Spanish courts. Lascorz also believed descent from the Laskarids could grant him a claim to the throne of the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Greece]], an idea he dedicated the rest of his life to.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} Instead of Eugenio Lascorz, his new legal name was Eugenio L\u00e1scaris-Comneno (often shortened to Eugenio L\u00e1scaris).{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=53}} At the time, Greece was embroiled in somewhat of a succession crisis; social tension and the abdication of King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] put the future of the ruling [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]] in doubt.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=54}}\n\nIn 1923, Lascorz issued a manifesto to the Greek people, proclaiming himself \"Prince Eugene Lascaris Comnenus, heir to the Emperors of Byzantium and Pretender to the Throne of Greece\". In 1935 he created an elaborate and invented genealogy, which notably altered his own familial history. His grandfather Victoriano was substituted for the \"Prince Andronikos Theodore Laskaris\" supposedly described by his father on his deathbed. Eugenio's great-grandgather Alonso was substituted for a \"Prince Theodore Laskaris, [[Porphyrogenitus]]\".'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' In the 1940s and 1950s, Lascorz undertook a series of efforts in an attempt to strengthen his imperial claim. In 1946, he attempted to expand his \"Sovereign and Imperial Order of Constantine the Great\" and his own order of Saint Helena into international organizations. In 1948, Lascorz began publishing his own magazine, ''Parthenon'', with the Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Greco-Espa\u00f1ola (the Greco-Spanish Cultural Association, an organization based in Madrid) and on 15 September 1950 he founded the \"International Philo Byzantine Academy and University\" (IPHBAU), a \"cultural extension\" of his self-proclaimed chivalric orders, which also had its own magazine.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}}\n\nHis first genealogy was contradicted by later genealogies in 1947 and 1952, which again changed the names of Eugenio's ancestors, added more supposed \"princes\" and altered their relationships. The 1952 version of the genealogy, the first to refer to Eugenio's father as \"Alexios Manuel\", explicitly contradicts Eugenio's earlier versions, which he had attempted to get approved by Spanish courts. Lascorz obtained \"recognition\" by several courts in Italy, though these courts did not investigate Eugenio's claims, nor did they have the competence or authority to proclaim someone as a claimant to the throne of the Byzantine Empire or the Kingdom of Greece. Lascorz married a woman by the name Nicasia Justa Micolau y Traver Blasco y Margell and had several children, all of which received names of ancient Byzantine royalty, such as Teodoro, Constantino, Alejandro and Juan Arcadio.'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}'''\n\nThough Lascorz made no intellectual contributions to the legal world during his years as an attorney and lawyer (instead spending his working years doing practical tasks and working), he was devoted to studying Ancient Greece and Byzantium, writing several books on Greek history. Lascorz's \"Byzantine\" publications were not limited to historical works. As soon as he had moved to Madrid in 1943, Lascorz published the work ''Cal\u00edgrafia grieca y byzantina'' (\"Greek and Byzantine [[Calligraphy]]\"), a collection of calligraphy exercises, beginning with tracing and then moving on to reproductions of real ancient Greek and Byzantine initials, manuscripts and signatures.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=22}} In 1956, Lascorz published ''Caliniki: Evocaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica'', a short story centering on a fictional Lacaedaemonian girl called Cali Cabasileas from the time of the emperor \"Manuel Cantacuzeno\" who falls in love with Andr\u00f3nico, a courtier of the emperor.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=23}}\n\n=== The ''Hidalgu\u00eda'' controversy ===\nThere were many who supported Lascorz's dynastic claims. Among his most notable supporters was Norberto de Castro y Tosi, a Costa Rican professor and personal friend of Eugenio who in 1989 published a biography on him, titled ''Eugenio II, un pr\u00edncipe de Byzancio'' (\"Eugene II, a prince of Byzantium\").{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=24}} Castro's biography was very favorable to Lascorz, leaving out many episodes which might have caused controversy, such as the role Lascorz played during the regime of Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] (as a [[military judge]]). In 1952, Lascorz had granted Castro the title of [[Marquess]] of [[Barzala]].{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=25}}\n\nIn 1953 and 1954, Lascorz and his family were the focus of the \"''Hidalgu\u00eda'' controversy\", a series of articles in Spanish magazines, including one called ''Hidalgu\u00eda'', which saw him publically identified as a forger and, as a result, becoming socially stigmatized.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=25}} The controversy had its roots in a campaign begun by the Holy See in Rome in 1952 against what the Papacy saw as false religious orders. This campaign had become highly publicized in the Spanish media by 1953, during the time when negotiations between the Papacy and the Spanish government were approaching an end.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}} Since Lascorz was at the head of several orders and organizations which could easily be included in what the Vatican perceived as false, he repeatedly aroused misgivings from the Spanish government and authorities.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}} On 23 April 1953, an article in the ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' newspaper called \"Falsas \u00f3rdenes de caballer\u00eda y falsos t\u00edtulos nobiliarios\" (\"False chivalric orders and false titles of nobility\") identified Lascorz as a forger and his orders and institutions as fake, stating that Lascorz violated \"not only the principles of Church law, but also the sovereignty of the Spanish state\". In later issues the newspaper also published and rebuked Lascorz's responses to the article, pointing out that his orders had not been approved by the Spanish government.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=27}}\n\nMore damaging than the ''ABC'' articles were articles published early in 1954 in ''Hidalgu\u00eda'' which denounced and debunked Lascorz's claims, sometimes in a somewhat humorous tone. The author of these articles, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Palacio, wrote that Lascorz had used his knowledge of the legal system and the complicity or ignorance of certain key people to carry out legal deceptions and falsifications in order to transform his identity and insert himself as a descendant of the Laskaris dynasty. Palacio furthermore (correctly) suggested that the end goal of this plan was to gain the throne of Greece.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=28}} On 13 March that same year, the Lascorz family responded through an interview with Teodoro (Eugenio's oldest son and then the speaker of the family due to Eugenio's advanced age) in the daily newspaper in Madrid, in which it was claimed that Palacio was an \"old enemy\" of their family and was actively attempting to \"persecute\" them.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=29}}\n\nAs a result of the controversy, any texts discussing Eugenio Lascorz and his family in the 1950s were either completely in their favor, or completely against them, the latter being more common.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}}\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nLascorz died in Madrid{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} on 1 June 1962.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=30}} Eugenio's children continued to maintain his claims and his self-proclaimed chivalric orders{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=30}} and his descendants, the L\u00e1scaris{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=15}} or L\u00e1scaris-Comneno{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=15}} family, survive to this day. Many of his children chose to leave Spain due to being exhausted by the controversies the family became embroiled in.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} His heir as \"titular emperor\" was his oldest son, Teodoro L\u00e1scaris-Comneno (27 October 1921\u201320 September 2006), who moved across the Atlantic. Though Teodoro maintained the legitimacy of his father's (and his own) claims, he was more concerned with researching law, history and philosophy and maintaining the orders of Constantine the Great and Saint Helene than he was in pressing the invented claim to the throne of the Kingdom of Greece.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=30}}\n\nTeodoro took the \"regnal\" name ''Theodore IX'' Lascaris Comnenus (Theodore III\u2013VIII being invented ancestors throughout Eugenio's genealogy), lived in Venezuela and propagated the idea that the [[Americas]] represent \"New Byzantium\"; where Christian faith, Western thought and Greek civilization will continue to survive.'''{{Sfn|Feldman|2008|p=135}}''' Teodoro's son Eugenio (born on 10 October 1975), or ''Eugene III'' Theodore Emmanuel Lascaris Comnenus, maintains his family's claims.'''{{Sfn|New Byzantium||p=}}'''\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Pretenders to the Byzantine throne]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* {{Cite book|last=Domingo|first=Carlos Sancho|url=https://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/36/43/_ebook.pdf|title=Eugenio L\u00e1scaris-Comneno: el aragon\u00e9s que pretendi\u00f3 el trono de Grecia|publisher=Instituci\u00f3n \"Fernando el Cat\u00f3lico\"|year=2017|isbn=978-8499114651|location=|pages=|language=Spanish|ref=CITEREFDomingo2017}}\n*{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Ruth Tenzer|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=-Ngv27cosOgC&dq=Lascaris+Comnenus&hl=sv&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Fall of Constantinople|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0761340263|pages=|ref=CITEREFFeldman2008}}\n\n=== Web sources ===\n\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-byzantium.org/houseof.html|title=The Great Seal of the Lascaris Comnenus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.new-byzantium.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-02|ref=CITEREFNew Byzantium}}\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/lascaris.htm|title=The Pseudo Lascaris Princes and Their Fantastic Claims|last=Sainty|first=Guy Stair|authorlink=Guy Stair Sainty|date=|website=European Royal Houses|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212011509/http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/lascaris.htm|archive-date=12 February 2005|access-date=|ref=CITEREFPseudo Lascaris Princes}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lascorz, Eugenio}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1962 deaths]]\n[[Category:Impostor pretenders]]\n[[Category:People from Zaragoza]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name               = Eugenio L\u00e1scaris\n| image              = \n| caption            = \n| other_names        = \n| birth_name         = Eugenio Lascorz y Labastida\n| birth_date         = {{Birth date|1886|3|26}}\n| birth_place        = [[Zaragoza]], Spain\n| death_date         = {{Death date and age|1962|6|1|1886|3|26}}\n| death_place        = [[Madrid]], Spain\n| nationality        = Spanish\n| occupation         = Lawyer, attorney and [[pretender]]\n| years_active       = {{circa}} 1906\u20131962\n| mother             = Carmen Labastida y Paschal\n| father             = Manuel Lascorz y Serveto\n}}\n'''Eugenio Lascorz y Labastida''' (26 March 1886\u20131 June 1962) was a Spanish attorney and lawyer who claimed to be a descendant of the medieval [[Laskaris]] family (believing his last name ''Lascorz'' to be a corruption of ''Laskaris''), which had ruled the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]] from 1204 to 1261.

His life's work was his attempt to get his claims recognized and his desire to claim the throne of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] and restore the Byzantine Empire.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Ancestry and early life ===\nEugenio Lascorz y Labastida was born in [[Zaragoza]] about 21:15 on 26 March 1886{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=41}} and as per Spanish naming customs, took the surnames of both his parents, Manuel Lascorz y Serveto (born in 1849) and Carmen Labastida y Paschal (born in 1857).{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} He was baptized two days after his birth in the parish church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar (meaning \"[[Our Lady of the Pillar]]\"). His paternal grandparents were the laborer Victori\u00e1n Lascorz y Abad and Raimunda Serveto and his maternal grandparents were Manuel Labastida and Ramona Paschal.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=41}} His great-grandfather (the father of Victori\u00e1n) was a man by the name Alonso Lascorz y Cerdan.'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' The Lascorz family, and Eugenio's other ancestors, was of [[Basques|Basque]] (and not Greek) origin'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' and were likely part of a barrage of migrants who had arrived in Zaragoza in the third quarter of the 19th century.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=41}}\n\nThe Lascorz family was wealthy and Eugenio's father Manuel had studied law and the Latin language and he was an important man in Zaragoza, working as the secretary of the local [[Provincial deputation (Spain)|provincial deputation]].{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=42}} Manuel and Carmen had three children, Eugenio being the youngest. His older siblings were Lorenzo (1877\u20131900) and Josefina (1881\u20131956). Both Eugenio and Lorenzo studied at the [[University of Zaragoza]].{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=43}} Lorenzo studied medicine while Eugenio studied law. Tragically, Lorenzo died in 1900 at the age of just 22, and Eugenio became the \"heir\" to Manuel.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=44}} Eugenio began his professional career as an attorney in 1917.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} When exactly Lascorz began his Byzantine claims is unclear, later family tradition claims that his father \"revealed\" their family history on his deathbed on 5 August 1906, proclaiming to Eugenio and Josefina that he was not just Manuel Lascorz y Serveto, but Prince Alexios Manuel Lasc\u00e1ris-Comneno, who had arrived with his father Prince Andronikos in Spain after fleeing from Ottoman persecution.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=45}} Manuel's obituaries stated that he was a \"descendant and heir of the ancient Greek imperial family of the same surname, fleeing from the ruins of his homeland\".{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=49}}\n\n=== Byzantine claims and aspirations ===\nLascorz, possibly inspired by his father, believed that his last name was a corruption of ''[[Laskaris]]'', the name of a medieval Greek dynasty which had ruled the [[Byzantine Empire]] in [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]] from 1204 to 1261.'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' Explicitly proclaiming to restore the ancient glory of the Byzantine Empire, Lascorz was a proponent of the Greek [[Megali Idea]] (the Greek aspirations of conquering former Byzantine territory, including Constantinople, and restoring the borders of Byzantium).{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=51}} He embarked on a campaign of attempting to secure recognition of this descent through changing his legal identity by substituting \"Lascorz\" for \"L\u00e1scaris\" and seeking approval in Spanish courts. Lascorz also believed descent from the Laskarids could grant him a claim to the throne of the newly proclaimed [[Kingdom of Greece]], an idea he dedicated the rest of his life to.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} Instead of Eugenio Lascorz, his new legal name was Eugenio L\u00e1scaris-Comneno (often shortened to Eugenio L\u00e1scaris).{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=53}} At the time, Greece was embroiled in somewhat of a succession crisis; social tension and the abdication of King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] put the future of the ruling [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]] in doubt.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=54}}\n\nIn 1923, Lascorz issued a manifesto to the Greek people, proclaiming himself \"Prince Eugene Lascaris Comnenus, heir to the Emperors of Byzantium and Pretender to the Throne of Greece\". In 1935 he created an elaborate and invented genealogy, which notably altered his own familial history. His grandfather Victoriano was substituted for the \"Prince Andronikos Theodore Laskaris\" supposedly described by his father on his deathbed. Eugenio's great-grandgather Alonso was substituted for a \"Prince Theodore Laskaris, [[Porphyrogenitus]]\".'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}''' In the 1940s and 1950s, Lascorz undertook a series of efforts in an attempt to strengthen his imperial claim. In 1946, he attempted to expand his \"Sovereign and Imperial Order of Constantine the Great\" and his own order of Saint Helena into international organizations. In 1948, Lascorz began publishing his own magazine, ''Parthenon'', with the Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Greco-Espa\u00f1ola (the Greco-Spanish Cultural Association, an organization based in Madrid) and on 15 September 1950 he founded the \"International Philo Byzantine Academy and University\" (IPHBAU), a \"cultural extension\" of his self-proclaimed chivalric orders, which also had its own magazine.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}}\n\nHis first genealogy was contradicted by later genealogies in 1947 and 1952, which again changed the names of Eugenio's ancestors, added more supposed \"princes\" and altered their relationships. The 1952 version of the genealogy, the first to refer to Eugenio's father as \"Alexios Manuel\", explicitly contradicts Eugenio's earlier versions, which he had attempted to get approved by Spanish courts. Lascorz obtained \"recognition\" by several courts in Italy, though these courts did not investigate Eugenio's claims, nor did they have the competence or authority to proclaim someone as a claimant to the throne of the Byzantine Empire or the Kingdom of Greece. Lascorz married a woman by the name Nicasia Justa Micolau y Traver Blasco y Margell and had several children, all of which received names of ancient Byzantine royalty, such as Teodoro, Constantino, Alejandro and Juan Arcadio.'''{{Sfn|Pseudo Lascaris Princes||p=}}'''\n\nThough Lascorz made no intellectual contributions to the legal world during his years as an attorney and lawyer (instead spending his working years doing practical tasks and working), he was devoted to studying Ancient Greece and Byzantium, writing several books on Greek history. Lascorz's \"Byzantine\" publications were not limited to historical works. As soon as he had moved to Madrid in 1943, Lascorz published the work ''Cal\u00edgrafia grieca y byzantina'' (\"Greek and Byzantine [[Calligraphy]]\"), a collection of calligraphy exercises, beginning with tracing and then moving on to reproductions of real ancient Greek and Byzantine initials, manuscripts and signatures.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=22}} In 1956, Lascorz published ''Caliniki: Evocaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica'', a short story centering on a fictional Lacaedaemonian girl called Cali Cabasileas from the time of the emperor \"Manuel Cantacuzeno\" who falls in love with Andr\u00f3nico, a courtier of the emperor.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=23}}\n\n=== The ''Hidalgu\u00eda'' controversy ===\nThere were many who supported Lascorz's dynastic claims. Among his most notable supporters was Norberto de Castro y Tosi, a Costa Rican professor and personal friend of Eugenio who in 1989 published a biography on him, titled ''Eugenio II, un pr\u00edncipe de Byzancio'' (\"Eugene II, a prince of Byzantium\").{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=24}} Castro's biography was very favorable to Lascorz, leaving out many episodes which might have caused controversy, such as the role Lascorz played during the regime of Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] (as a [[military judge]]). In 1952, Lascorz had granted Castro the title of [[Marquess]] of [[Barzala]].{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=25}}\n\nIn 1953 and 1954, Lascorz and his family were the focus of the \"''Hidalgu\u00eda'' controversy\", a series of articles in Spanish magazines, including one called ''Hidalgu\u00eda'', which saw him publically identified as a forger and, as a result, becoming socially stigmatized.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=25}} The controversy had its roots in a campaign begun by the Holy See in Rome in 1952 against what the Papacy saw as false religious orders. This campaign had become highly publicized in the Spanish media by 1953, during the time when negotiations between the Papacy and the Spanish government were approaching an end.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}} Since Lascorz was at the head of several orders and organizations which could easily be included in what the Vatican perceived as false, he repeatedly aroused misgivings from the Spanish government and authorities.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}} On 23 April 1953, an article in the ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' newspaper called \"Falsas \u00f3rdenes de caballer\u00eda y falsos t\u00edtulos nobiliarios\" (\"False chivalric orders and false titles of nobility\") identified Lascorz as a forger and his orders and institutions as fake, stating that Lascorz violated \"not only the principles of Church law, but also the sovereignty of the Spanish state\". In later issues the newspaper also published and rebuked Lascorz's responses to the article, pointing out that his orders had not been approved by the Spanish government.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=27}}\n\nMore damaging than the ''ABC'' articles were articles published early in 1954 in ''Hidalgu\u00eda'' which denounced and debunked Lascorz's claims, sometimes in a somewhat humorous tone. The author of these articles, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Palacio, wrote that Lascorz had used his knowledge of the legal system and the complicity or ignorance of certain key people to carry out legal deceptions and falsifications in order to transform his identity and insert himself as a descendant of the Laskaris dynasty. Palacio furthermore (correctly) suggested that the end goal of this plan was to gain the throne of Greece.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=28}} On 13 March that same year, the Lascorz family responded through an interview with Teodoro (Eugenio's oldest son and then the speaker of the family due to Eugenio's advanced age) in the daily newspaper in Madrid, in which it was claimed that Palacio was an \"old enemy\" of their family and was actively attempting to \"persecute\" them.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=29}}\n\nAs a result of the controversy, any texts discussing Eugenio Lascorz and his family in the 1950s were either completely in their favor, or completely against them, the latter being more common.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=26}}\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nLascorz died in Madrid{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} on 1 June 1962.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=30}} Eugenio's children continued to maintain his claims and his self-proclaimed chivalric orders{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=30}} and his descendants, the L\u00e1scaris{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=15}} or L\u00e1scaris-Comneno{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=15}} family, survive to this day. Many of his children chose to leave Spain due to being exhausted by the controversies the family became embroiled in.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=17}} His heir as \"titular emperor\" was his oldest son, Teodoro L\u00e1scaris-Comneno (27 October 1921\u201320 September 2006), who moved across the Atlantic. Though Teodoro maintained the legitimacy of his father's (and his own) claims, he was more concerned with researching law, history and philosophy and maintaining the orders of Constantine the Great and Saint Helene than he was in pressing the invented claim to the throne of the Kingdom of Greece.{{Sfn|Domingo|2017|p=30}}\n\nTeodoro took the \"regnal\" name ''Theodore IX'' Lascaris Comnenus (Theodore III\u2013VIII being invented ancestors throughout Eugenio's genealogy), lived in Venezuela and propagated the idea that the [[Americas]] represent \"New Byzantium\"; where Christian faith, Western thought and Greek civilization will continue to survive.'''{{Sfn|Feldman|2008|p=135}}''' Teodoro's son Eugenio (born on 10 October 1975), or ''Eugene III'' Theodore Emmanuel Lascaris Comnenus, maintains his family's claims.'''{{Sfn|New Byzantium||p=}}'''\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Pretenders to the Byzantine throne]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n* {{Cite book|last=Domingo|first=Carlos Sancho|url=https://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/36/43/_ebook.pdf|title=Eugenio L\u00e1scaris-Comneno: el aragon\u00e9s que pretendi\u00f3 el trono de Grecia|publisher=Instituci\u00f3n \"Fernando el Cat\u00f3lico\"|year=2017|isbn=978-8499114651|location=|pages=|language=Spanish|ref=CITEREFDomingo2017}}\n*{{cite book|last=Feldman|first=Ruth Tenzer|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=-Ngv27cosOgC&dq=Lascaris+Comnenus&hl=sv&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Fall of Constantinople|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0761340263|pages=|ref=CITEREFFeldman2008}}\n\n=== Web sources ===\n\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-byzantium.org/houseof.html|title=The Great Seal of the Lascaris Comnenus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.new-byzantium.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-02|ref=CITEREFNew Byzantium}}\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/lascaris.htm|title=The Pseudo Lascaris Princes and Their Fantastic Claims|last=Sainty|first=Guy Stair|authorlink=Guy Stair Sainty|date=|website=European Royal Houses|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212011509/http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/fantasy/lascaris.htm|archive-date=12 February 2005|access-date=|ref=CITEREFPseudo Lascaris Princes}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lascorz, Eugenio}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1962 deaths]]\n[[Category:Impostor pretenders]]\n[[Category:People from Zaragoza]]\n", "name_user": "Tamfang", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:avoid letting \u201c1886\u20131\u201d look like a unit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Lascorz"}
