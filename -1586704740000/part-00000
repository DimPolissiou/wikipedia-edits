In 1995, it combined the two development teams to form [[IXI Visionware]]. This later became SCO's Client Integration Division.\nClient Integration was relatively independent of the rest of SCO. It specialized in software to integrate [[Microsoft Windows]] and UNIX systems, It operated its own web site for some time and ported its code to all major UNIX platforms, including those of SCO's competitors.\n\n=== AT&T System V ===\nIn 1995, SCO acquired the [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[UNIX System V]] [[source code]] from [[Novell]] and eventually became the licensor for UNIX. This allowed it to port [[System V Release 4]] features into SCO UNIX. However, in 2007 a court ruled that Novell still owned the copyrights to original AT&T UNIX source code and derivatives.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gohring |first1=Nancy |date=August 11, 2007 |title=Novell wins rights to Unix copyrights |website=[[Computerworld]] |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2543059/technology-law-regulation/novell-wins-rights-to-unix-copyrights.html}}</ref>\n\nSCO also acquired the [[UnixWare]] [[operating system]] from Novell, at which time it renamed SCO UNIX as [[SCO OpenServer]]. They were eventually able to re-use some code from that version of UnixWare in later releases of OpenServer. SCO released several versions of UnixWare, notably version 7 starting in 1997, which merged UnixWare 2 and OpenServer 5.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, SCO Unix systems had around 15,000 [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs) around the world.\n\n=== Asset sale ===\n{{see also|Tarantella, Inc.}}\nIn April 2000, SCO reorganized into three divisions: Server Software, Professional Services and Tarantella.\n\nIn May 2001, SCO completed the sale of its Server Software and Services Divisions, as well as UnixWare and OpenServer technologies, to [[Caldera Systems]], Inc. At that time Caldera Systems changed its name to \"Caldera International\", and the remaining part of SCO, the Tarantella Division, changed its name to \"[[Tarantella, Inc.]]\"\n\nIn August 2002, [[Caldera International]] renamed itself \"[[The SCO Group]]\" since the SCO UNIX products were still a strong source of revenue mainly due to the huge installed base dating back to the 1990s. That entity soon started the [[SCO-Linux controversies]].\n\n== Company culture ==\nFrom its inception and founding by [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] graduate Doug Michels, the company drew upon the readily available technical talent who chose to remain in the central California coastal town of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] after graduating.\n\n=== SCO Forum ===\n{{main|SCO Forum}}\nBeginning in 1987, SCO hosted an annual Summer conference for the international Unix community.

Grace is ultimately made CEO, but turns it down for a better job. This show includes the infamous \"Die Hard\" video by late Follies action director Peter (Israel) Rosencrantz. In the current climate, it's hard to picture a CEO giving permission for employees to parade through the building carrying automatic weapons, let alone appearing in the video himself. But Swedish-born Lars Turndal sat for an hour with guns trained on him by some wacky Americans as if he'd been doing it all his life.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1994 || '''The Phantom of the Operation''' || Software engineer Eric T. Claudin runs afoul of evil VP Edwin Vincent Leach, who is bent on SCO's destruction. Disfigured in a hot tub \"accident\" arranged by Leach, Eric becomes the Phantom, a dark figure obsessed with saving the firm. Once again, then-CEO Lars Turndal proved he was a real sport and consented to appear in his second (and last) video, one that roasted the executive team for trying to censor the Usenet feed. Brian Moffet produced the stained-glass style panorama that opens the show. \n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1995 || '''FCS Can Wait''' || For the uninitiated, FCS is \"First Customer Ship,\" the magic goal of the product development cycle. Based on the films \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" and Heaven Can Wait,\" Engineering manager Jo Pendleton is hurled into the great void ahead of schedule. Bodies must be swapped and Heaven & Earth must be moved so that Jo can complete her project of a lifetime, \"SCO DoomBugger\".\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1996 || '''UNIX Won't Die''' || After a series of high-profile incidents involving glitches in the UNIX operating system (namely Apollo 13, Three Mile Island, and the Exxon Valdez), James Bond tracks the SPECTRE of his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld into the hallways of SCO. Along for the ride is the mysterious Tilly Masterson (sister of the woman who was suffocated in paint by the nefarious Goldfinger). Software engineer Fox Mulder and Dana Sculley (\"a schmuck from Legal\") have stumbled onto the UNIX plot and are suspicious of Bond's presence.  This show was the first to include digital compositing (a couple of laser beams and explosions). These early steps were taken on a Miro DC20 video card and Adobe Premiere purchased with pooled funds. Bill Welch created these effects and Mike Almond provided the opening Star Wars animation using Caligari TrueSpace. Thereafter, nearly all the effects for Follies were created digitally.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1997 || '''Taming of the CEO''' || A Shakespearean romp where Viola Murch, a top female director who despairs of ever becoming a VP, decides to disguise herself as a man. She learns that the top floor is a far stranger place than she imagined. This show included a mock preview for a show called \"Sliders\" about parallel SCO universes. This marked the full use of digital effects and compositing. Mike Almond was responsible for creating such 3D items as a phalanx of Imperial Stormtroopers and a streaking Millennium Falcon.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1998 || '''A Solstice Carol''' || The story of Ezekiel Kludge, a crusty longtime SCO manager who re-discovers the true meaning of SCO.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1999 || '''The Wizard of OCS''' || IBM engineering manager Dorothy Gale is transported into the wacky world of OCS, where she meets a Marketeer who wants to lose his brain, A Salesman who wants to get rid of his heart, and an Engineer who wants to get rid of his life.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 2000 || '''Willy Wonka and the Software Factory''' || \nSupport specialist Charlotte Bucket dreams of visiting SCO's Software Factory and Willy Wonka, the \"Chief Geek\" who no-one has seen for years. It's an adventure populated with Corpa Lorpas, Waffling Precompensators, Paleoatavistic Patch Pellucidators, and Everlasting Spamstoppers. Not to mention Fizzy Linux stocks. And some arrogant, selfish, and greedy adult children get their comeuppance as well.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 2001 || '''Fiddler on the 425 Roof''' || The \"final\" SCO Follies occurred shortly after [[Caldera Systems]] purchased the Santa Cruz Operation. Thus the show's theme is change, with Caldera Systems as the Cossacks. The show opens with the \"Dawn of Spam\" sequence adapted from Stanley Kubrick's classic odyssey. The mood of the \"Linux Company\" finale was overturned when the radically downsized, later-named \"SCO Group\" turned against Linux. \n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 2012 || '''Raiders of the Lost Archive''' || When two members of a secret SCO organization are murdered, the SCOllegium assigns a team of ex-SCOites to find out who is responsible.\n|}\n\n== Alliances ==\nSCO was a primary partner in several industry alliances, intended to promote SCO operating system technology as a de facto standard for emerging hardware platforms.  The most notable of these were:\n\n* [[Advanced Computing Environment|The ACE Consortium]] \u2013 Founded by [[Compaq]], [[Microsoft]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and SCO in 1991, to drive the next generation of PCs powered by the [[Advanced RISC Computing]] Specification (ARC)\n* [[3DA]] \u2013 Formed by SCO and [[Hewlett Packard]] in 1995, to define the standard Unix for [[IA-64]] systems\n* [[Project Monterey]] \u2013 Formed by SCO, IBM, [[Sequent Computer Systems|Sequent]] and Intel in 1998, to define the standard UNIX for IA-64 systems\n\nNone of these alliances was ultimately successful.\n\nSCO was also part of 1993's [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] initiative, a more successful and broadly supported initiative to create an open and unified UNIX standard.\n\nSCO was a founding member of [[86open]] (1997-1999), hosting the first meeting of the Unix on Intel standards effort.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Interactive Systems Corporation]], an early competitor of SCO in the Unix for PC market\n* [[SCO Group]] for the continuance of the Unix Server and Services Divisions after 2001\n* [[Xinuos]] (previously [[UnXis]]) for the continuance of the SCO-related Unix products after 2011\n* [[Tarantella, Inc.]] for the continuance of the Client Integration Division after 2001\n* [[SCO Skunkware]], a collection of [[Open-source software|open source]] packages for SCO platforms (currently maintained by the SCO Group)\n* [[SCO OpenServer]], a version of the Unix computer operating system developed by SCO and now maintained by the SCO Group\n* [[UnixWare]], a version of the Unix computer operating system developed by AT&T's [[Unix System Laboratories]], maintained by SCO from 1995 to 2001 and maintained since then by the SCO Group\n* [[Venix]], an early PC Unix distribution made by another company (VenturCom)\n* [[Xenix]], a version of the Unix computer operating system based on AT&T's UNIX System III, ported and distributed on the [[x86]] PC architecture by SCO\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.

It specialized in software to integrate [[Microsoft Windows]] and UNIX systems, It operated its own web site for some time and ported its code to all major UNIX platforms, including those of SCO's competitors.\n\n=== AT&T System V ===\nIn 1995, SCO acquired the [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[UNIX System V]] [[source code]] from [[Novell]] and eventually became the licensor for UNIX.

At that time Caldera Systems changed its name to \"Caldera International\", and the remaining part of SCO, the Tarantella Division, changed its name to \"[[Tarantella, Inc.]]\"\n\nIn August 2002, [[Caldera International]] renamed itself \"[[The SCO Group]]\" since the SCO UNIX products were still a strong source of revenue mainly due to the huge installed base dating back to the 1990s.

This was a fully scripted and produced satire skewering SCO management and the high-tech industry. It featured live action, musical numbers, and videos.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/profile_play_list?user=motibloc |title=motibloc's Playlists\n|access-date=May 14, 2008 |author-first=Stephen |author-last=Marino |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>\nOn September 22, 2012, the SCO Alumni Association hosted the SCOGala Reunion party at the Cocoanut Grove, which included the first SCO Follies since 2001. Some 500 former employees, friends, and family attended the event.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !! Description\n|-\n| 1985 || '''Star Trek''' || Scripts in hand, early SCO employees go where no company has gone before.\n|-\n| 1986 || ''unknown'' || -\n|-\n| 1987 || ''unknown'' || -\n|-\n| 1988 || '''Cheers''' || Sometimes you want to go where no-one knows your login name.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1989 || '''Larry Wants an Ad''' || Exasperated with Bruce Steinberg's hairbrained ideas, Larry Michels asks employees to submit concepts for a new ad campaign.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1990 || '''Late Night with Doug Michels''' || SCO licenses the \"Late Night\" format from GE with Doug as host. Guests include the XENIX Colonel, Michael J. Foxplus (promoting \"Backup to the Future II\", guitarist Tracy Chapman,{{cn|date=December 2019|reason=Added by Motibloc in 2012. Changed by an IP into Tracy Parker in 2019.}} and (direct from the mail room) \"Elvis\".\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1991 || '''KODT''' || SCO launches a cable television channel that requires a telethon to raise funds for the equally cash-strapped organization (operating under the banner of \"almost\" public television). \n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1992 || '''Archaeological Dig''' || The year is 2100 and the world has only recently recovered from a catastrophic era known as \"The Corporate Wars\". Drs. Dave Loman and Jane Greenleaf are recovering artifacts from the original SCO site in New Santa Cruz. The archaeologists are working under the supervision of an overbearing AI known as the NED 9.0.1 Project Management System, and Michelle Michels, descendant of the founders of SCO. With a little hacking, a kinder, wackier NED makes for a much less stressful work environment.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1993 || '''How to Succeed in the Software Business''' || Job applicant Grace Hopper joins the company via social engineering. With the help of a book on the software business, Grace hopscotches across the SCO org chart with stints in Manufacturing, Support, Engineering, Sales, and Marketing. Meanwhile, VP and co-founder Doug Michels is rescued from a car crash and imprisoned by a deranged ex-SCO employee named Annie Wilkes. Grace is ultimately made CEO, but turns it down for a better job. This show includes the infamous \"Die Hard\" video by late Follies action director Peter (Israel) Rosencrantz. In the current climate, it's hard to picture a CEO giving permission for employees to parade through the building carrying automatic weapons, let alone appearing in the video himself. But Swedish-born Lars Turndal sat for an hour with guns trained on him by some wacky Americans as if he'd been doing it all his life.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1994 || '''The Phantom of the Operation''' || Software engineer Eric T. Claudin runs afoul of evil VP Edwin Vincent Leach, who is bent on SCO's destruction. Disfigured in a hot tub \"accident\" arranged by Leach, Eric becomes the Phantom, a dark figure obsessed with saving the firm. Once again, then-CEO Lars Turndal proved he was a real sport and consented to appear in his second (and last) video, one that roasted the executive team for trying to censor the Usenet feed. Brian Moffet produced the stained-glass style panorama that opens the show. \n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1995 || '''FCS Can Wait''' || For the uninitiated, FCS is \"First Customer Ship,\" the magic goal of the product development cycle. Based on the films \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" and Heaven Can Wait,\" Engineering manager Jo Pendleton is hurled into the great void ahead of schedule. Bodies must be swapped and Heaven & Earth must be moved so that Jo can complete her project of a lifetime, \"SCO DoomBugger\".\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1996 || '''UNIX Won't Die''' || After a series of high-profile incidents involving glitches in the UNIX operating system (namely Apollo 13, Three Mile Island, and the Exxon Valdez), James Bond tracks the SPECTRE of his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld into the hallways of SCO. Along for the ride is the mysterious Tilly Masterson (sister of the woman who was suffocated in paint by the nefarious Goldfinger). Software engineer Fox Mulder and Dana Sculley (\"a schmuck from Legal\") have stumbled onto the UNIX plot and are suspicious of Bond's presence.  This show was the first to include digital compositing (a couple of laser beams and explosions). These early steps were taken on a Miro DC20 video card and Adobe Premiere purchased with pooled funds. Bill Welch created these effects and Mike Almond provided the opening Star Wars animation using Caligari TrueSpace. Thereafter, nearly all the effects for Follies were created digitally.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1997 || '''Taming of the CEO''' || A Shakespearean romp where Viola Murch, a top female director who despairs of ever becoming a VP, decides to disguise herself as a man. She learns that the top floor is a far stranger place than she imagined. This show included a mock preview for a show called \"Sliders\" about parallel SCO universes. This marked the full use of digital effects and compositing. Mike Almond was responsible for creating such 3D items as a phalanx of Imperial Stormtroopers and a streaking Millennium Falcon.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1998 || '''A Solstice Carol''' || The story of Ezekiel Kludge, a crusty longtime SCO manager who re-discovers the true meaning of SCO.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 1999 || '''The Wizard of OCS''' || IBM engineering manager Dorothy Gale is transported into the wacky world of OCS, where she meets a Marketeer who wants to lose his brain, A Salesman who wants to get rid of his heart, and an Engineer who wants to get rid of his life.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 2000 || '''Willy Wonka and the Software Factory''' || \nSupport specialist Charlotte Bucket dreams of visiting SCO's Software Factory and Willy Wonka, the \"Chief Geek\" who no-one has seen for years. It's an adventure populated with Corpa Lorpas, Waffling Precompensators, Paleoatavistic Patch Pellucidators, and Everlasting Spamstoppers. Not to mention Fizzy Linux stocks. And some arrogant, selfish, and greedy adult children get their comeuppance as well.\n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 2001 || '''Fiddler on the 425 Roof''' || The \"final\" SCO Follies occurred shortly after [[Caldera Systems]] purchased the Santa Cruz Operation. Thus the show's theme is change, with Caldera Systems as the Cossacks. The show opens with the \"Dawn of Spam\" sequence adapted from Stanley Kubrick's classic odyssey. The mood of the \"Linux Company\" finale was overturned when the radically downsized, later-named \"SCO Group\" turned against Linux. \n|-\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 2012 || '''Raiders of the Lost Archive''' || When two members of a secret SCO organization are murdered, the SCOllegium assigns a team of ex-SCOites to find out who is responsible.\n|}\n\n== Alliances ==\nSCO was a primary partner in several industry alliances, intended to promote SCO operating system technology as a de facto standard for emerging hardware platforms.  The most notable of these were:\n\n* [[Advanced Computing Environment|The ACE Consortium]] \u2013 Founded by [[Compaq]], [[Microsoft]], [[MIPS Computer Systems]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and SCO in 1991, to drive the next generation of PCs powered by the [[Advanced RISC Computing]] Specification (ARC)\n* [[3DA]] \u2013 Formed by SCO and [[Hewlett Packard]] in 1995, to define the standard Unix for [[IA-64]] systems\n* [[Project Monterey]] \u2013 Formed by SCO, IBM, [[Sequent Computer Systems|Sequent]] and Intel in 1998, to define the standard UNIX for IA-64 systems\n\nNone of these alliances was ultimately successful.\n\nSCO was also part of 1993's [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] initiative, a more successful and broadly supported initiative to create an open and unified UNIX standard.\n\nSCO was a founding member of [[86open]] (1997-1999), hosting the first meeting of the Unix on Intel standards effort.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Interactive Systems Corporation]], an early competitor of SCO in the Unix for PC market\n* [[SCO Group]] for the continuance of the Unix Server and Services Divisions after 2001\n* [[Xinuos]] (previously [[UnXis]]) for the continuance of the SCO-related Unix products after 2011\n* [[Tarantella, Inc.]] for the continuance of the Client Integration Division after 2001\n* [[SCO Skunkware]], a collection of [[Open-source software|open source]] packages for SCO platforms (currently maintained by the SCO Group)\n* [[SCO OpenServer]], a version of the Unix computer operating system developed by SCO and now maintained by the SCO Group\n* [[UnixWare]], a version of the Unix computer operating system developed by AT&T's [[Unix System Laboratories]], maintained by SCO from 1995 to 2001 and maintained since then by the SCO Group\n* [[Venix]], an early PC Unix distribution made by another company (VenturCom)\n* [[Xenix]], a version of the Unix computer operating system based on AT&T's UNIX System III, ported and distributed on the [[x86]] PC architecture by SCO\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc.

This species was named in honor of Reverend [[John Bachman]].<ref name = \"BNA\"/>\n\nAdults have [[rufous]] brown upperparts and crown with gray and black streaking on the nape, back and primaries. The face is gray with a rufous brown eyestripe. It has a [[Buff (colour)|buff]] colored breast and whitish belly. These are mid-sized New World sparrows, measuring {{convert|12.2|-|16.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|18.4|-|23|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref>''CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses'', John B. Dunning Jr. (ed.). CRC Press (1992), {{ISBN|978-0849342585}}.</ref>\n\nTheir breeding habitat is open [[pine]] [[Temperate coniferous forest|forests]]. The domed nest is usually built on the ground near a clump of grass or a bush. Females lay three to five eggs.\n\nBachman's sparrow is primarily a non-migratory resident, but it may retreat from some of the most northerly territories. The species is mainly a [[Seed predation|granivore]], but it will also take some [[insect]]s.\n\nThis bird is considered [[near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]], with habitat loss one of the major factors often cited in its decline. Habitat degradation due to later stages of forest [[Ecological succession|succession]] has also been attributed to the decline of this species. [[Controlled burn|Prescribed forest burns]] may assist in recovery.\n\nThe song begins as a clear whistle, followed by a short trill.\n\n==Distribution==\nBachman's sparrows occur primarily in the southeastern United States from the central region of peninsular Florida north to southeastern North Carolina and west through portions of Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri to eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas.<ref name=r19/><ref name=r47/><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Watts|first=Bryan D.|date=2015|journal=Virginia Journal of Science|title=Breeding birds of Virginia |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=223\u2013276 |url=https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1364&context=vjs|doi=10.25778/31dc-jz42}}</ref> Following forest conversion and the spread of agricultural fields up into the early 1900s, Bachman's sparrows rapidly expanded their range and began breeding in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania.<ref name=r19/><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"r45\">Mumford, Russell E.; Keller, Charles E. 1984.

The earliest date for Bachman's sparrow eggs in Florida is 14 April and the latest date is 4 August.<ref name=r62/> The earliest Bachman's sparrow nest found during a study in [[longleaf pine]] habitat of South Carolina was 10 April, while the latest nest found was early in the incubation stage on 5 August.<ref name=r63/> In a study of Bachman's sparrow reproduction in [[shortleaf pine|shortleaf]] and [[loblolly pine]] plantations of Arkansas, egg laying started as early as 17 April and continued until 26 August. However, 85% of clutches were started in May, June, or July.<ref name=r19/><ref name=r30/>\n\nBachman's sparrows typically raise 2 broods per breeding season and will renest after failed attempts.<ref name=r30/> In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, the average time between fledging of the 1st brood and starting the second brood was 12.3 days. This was not significantly (p=0.39) different from the 9.7-day average period between a failed nest and a subsequent nest attempt. On average, females attempted 3.1 nests per season. The maximum number of attempts per season was five.<ref name=r30/> The maximum number of nests attempted in longleaf pine habitat of South Carolina was also five. After two successful nests, a female attempted three times to raise a third brood.<ref name=r63/> Limited evidence suggests that three broods per season may occur occasionally.<ref name=r19/><ref name=r62/>\n\nBachman's sparrow nests are constructed on the ground by females and are primarily made of grasses. All nests (n=71) found in a study in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas were built on the ground. Most nests (70%) were built at the base of bluestem clumps, although nests were found at the base of small trees, forbs, and other grass species.<ref name=r30/> Bachman's sparrow nests are dome-shaped with an opening typically oriented to the north.<ref name=r19/><ref name=\"r45\" /><ref name=r62/><ref name=r31/> However, there is some variation in nest shape and on the Arkansas study site above, only 7% of nests were not either partially or completely domed. Bachman's sparrow nest shape may vary geographically, as nests found farther north in their historic range were infrequently domed.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[avian clutch size|Clutch size]] varies from three to five.<ref name=r45/><ref name=r62/> Average clutch size on a site in Arkansas was 3.9,<ref name=r30/> while in a longleaf pine community in South Carolina mean clutch size was 3.6.<ref name=r63/> Both of these studies found significant (p\u22640.02) decreases in clutch size as the breeding season progressed.<ref name=r63/><ref name=r30/> On a dry prairie site in Florida (n=9) average clutch size was 3.44 and on another (n=5) it was 3.6.<ref name=r50/> In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, females laid an average of 11.6 eggs (n=20) over the course of the breeding season.<ref name=r30/>\n\nIn shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations in Arkansas, females incubated eggs for 13 to 14 days. The average nestling period was 9 days, and the average period between fledging and independence was 25 days. Both parents care for the young during these periods.<ref name=r30/> A review suggests that Bachman's sparrows probably breed the year after hatching.<ref name=r19/>\n\nBachman's sparrows exhibit some fidelity to breeding sites. Over a two-year period in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of central Arkansas, 6 of 34 adults returned to areas where they had a territory in a previous year. This varied across years, with a 29% return rate of adult birds banded in 1983 and none of the adults banded in 1984 returning to the site in 1985. No juveniles (n=60) returned to the site.<ref name=r30/>\n\n===Nesting success===\nValues of nest success reported for Bachman's sparrows vary. Daily nest survival rate of Bachman's sparrow ranged from 0.89 to 0.96 across sites and years in the dry prairie of central Florida. On average 3.13 birds were fledged per successful Bachman's sparrow nest. Estimates of productivity ranged from 1.21 to 4.16 offspring per pair per year across sites and years.<ref name=r50/> In a South Carolina longleaf pine community, daily survival rate of Bachman's sparrow nests in 1995 was 0.952, which was significantly (p=0.04) higher than the 1996 daily nest survival rate of 0.889. Earlier nesting attempts (before June 15, n=15) had significantly (p=0.05) higher survival rates than those started later in the year (n=11). Daily nest survival rate was 0.922 during incubation and 0.973 during the nestling stage.<ref name=r63/> In central Arkansas, daily success rate during the incubation period was 0.965, while in the nestling period it was 0.919.<ref name=r30/> In the glades of south-central Missouri, 8 female Bachman's sparrows fledged an average of 1.5 young per season over 2 years.<ref name=r10/> Predation accounted for 80% of egg loss on study sites in Arkansas<ref name=r30/> and 94% of nest failures on sites in central Florida.<ref name=r50/> Daily survival rates of nests in the Sandhills of North Carolina were 0.947<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fish, Alexander Christopher, author.|title=Effects of Ground-based Military Training on Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) Breeding Ecology|oclc=984128181}}</ref> and 0.951.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Winiarski|first=Jason M.|last2=Fish|first2=Alexander C.|last3=Moorman|first3=Christopher E.|last4=Carpenter|first4=John P.|last5=DePerno|first5=Christopher S.|last6=Schillaci|first6=Jessica M.|date=August 2017|title=Nest-site selection and nest survival of Bachman's Sparrows in two longleaf pine communities|journal=The Condor|volume=119|issue=3|pages=361\u2013374|doi=10.1650/condor-16-220.1|issn=0010-5422}}</ref> Nest survival in North Carolina and South Carolina declined significantly later in the breeding season.<ref name=\"r63\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nInformation on Bachman's sparrow nest predators can be found in the Predators section of this summary.

In Georgia, Bachman's sparrows did not occur in open areas with uniformly dense herbaceous vegetation, despite these sites having a similar volume of vegetation \u22643 feet (1 m) above ground as recently burned pineland sites that were occupied by Bachman's sparrow.<ref name=r28/> Although measurements were not taken, observations of Bachman's sparrow in clearcuts in eastern Texas suggest they may favor tall grass in clumpy rather that uniform distribution.<ref name=r70/> In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, explanations suggested for a lack of evidence of ground layer features influencing selection of breeding territories included importance of habitat characteristics that were not measured, such as patchiness of the [[herbaceous layer]] and species composition.<ref name=r32/> In a predominantly longleaf pine forest in Georgia, Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p=0.04) more abundant in areas where ground cover was primarily Beyrich threeawn (''Aristida beyrichiana''), compared to relatively disturbed communities of bluestems (''Andropogon'' spp.) and silkgrass (''Pityopsis'' spp.).<ref name=r55/>\n\nAmount of litter and debris on a site may influence Bachman's sparrow habitat selection. Percent litter cover was consistently high (>58%) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrow in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina.<ref name=r33/> Although statistical significance was not tested due to small sample size, Bachman's sparrows occurred at higher densities in control plots (1.5 territories/40 ha) than plots that had downed [[coarse woody debris]] >4&nbsp;inches (10&nbsp;cm) in diameter removed (0.4 territories/40 ha) in a loblolly pine forest of South Carolina. Haggerty<ref name=r33/> suggests that litter may provide habitat for Bachman's sparrow prey, but that too much litter could interfere with foraging. In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, litter cover (78%) and depth (0.5&nbsp;inches (1.2&nbsp;cm) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p\u22640.01) lower than litter cover (88.9%) and depth (1.6&nbsp;inches (4.2&nbsp;cm)) on unoccupied sites.<ref name=r32/>\n\nBachman's sparrow inhabits areas with open overstories. In sites in eastern Texas of varying age since clearcutting, study areas occupied by Bachman's sparrows had significantly (p<0.01) fewer short (\u2264 10 feet (3m)) and tall (>10 feet (3m)) trees than unoccupied study areas.<ref name=r5/> In longleaf and loblolly pine stands of varying ages and under different management in South Carolina, plots occupied by Bachman's sparrows consistently had low volumes of vegetation from 7 to 13 feet (2\u20134 m) above ground compared to unoccupied sites.<ref name=r18/> In middle-aged and mature forests of Georgia composed primarily of loblolly pine, Bachman sparrow densities were negatively associated with tree/shrub volume and vegetation volume from 7 to <16 feet (3 to <5 m).<ref name=r28>Gobris, Nancy M. 1992. Habitat occupancy during the breeding season by Bachman's Sparrow at Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in central Georgia. Athens, GA: University of Georgia.

However, relative abundance of Bachman's sparrows was not significantly (p=0.107) associated with canopy cover and there were no significant (p=0.133) differences in canopy cover between occupied and unoccupied sites.<ref name=r52/>\n\nThere is evidence that Bachman sparrow may select sites with some tall vegetation. In north-central Florida, densities of Bachman's sparrows in young (2\u20134 years) slash pine plantations with artificial snags added (n=3) was 31.4 pairs/km\u00b2, while in similar vegetation without snags (n=3) Bachman's sparrow density was 22.3 pairs/km\u00b2 [8]. In an area in South Carolina composed of longleaf and loblolly pine, Bachman's sparrow occurred at significantly (p=0.002) higher density in clearcuts than middle-aged (22\u201350 years) stands, while in another area clearcuts had relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows. Vegetation differences between the 2 sites are likely to explain the difference. The site with relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows had been drumchopped, which resulted in a lower volume of vegetation from 3 to 7 feet (1\u20132 m) above ground. The authors suggest that the lack of vegetation in this height range may have limited perches, resulting in fewer birds on the site.<ref name=r18/> An investigation of Bachman's sparrow habitat characteristics in 1- to 6-year-old loblolly pine stands of eastern Texas led to recommendations that 2 to 5 tall (>39 feet (12 m)) trees/100 ha remain on a clearcut for Bachman sparrow singing perches.<ref name=r70>Wan Ramle, Wan A.

Thesis</ref> In Georgia, the lack of vegetation from 10 to <16 feet (3 to <5 m) was suggested as a possible reason for the absence of Bachman's sparrows from open field vegetation.<ref name=r28/> However, across the southeast, vegetation density from 3 to 6 feet (0.91\u20131.8 m) above ground varies widely on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows, suggesting their requirements for the density of this vegetation layer are comparatively flexible.<ref name=r33/>\n\nIn the dry prairie of central Florida, Bachman's sparrows used clumps of saw-palmetto that had \"natural\" burrows significantly (p<0.001) more than would be expected based on availability. The authors suggest that Bachman's sparrows in prairie habitat use burrows as areas of refuge from predators.<ref name=r14/>\n\n===Landscape level effects===\nSeveral studies have investigated the importance of landscape attributes on Bachman's sparrows. For a discussion of the possible importance of patchiness of vegetation within a site see the habitat characteristics section.\n\nThe ability of the Bachman's sparrow to detect and colonize areas before they are no longer suitable may depend on the size and isolation of the habitat. In south-central Missouri, only glades \u2265 29 acres (11.7 ha) were occupied by Bachman's sparrows.<ref name=r10/> The probability of Bachman's sparrow occupying pine-grassland restoration stands in Mississippi increased as size of areas with long burning rotations, short-harvest rotations, and no removal of hardwoods decreased (p=0.05) and as the perimeter to area ratio of these areas increased (p=0.02).<ref name=r73/> In South Carolina, distance from source populations significantly (p\u2264 0.05) influenced the ability of Bachman's sparrows to colonize recent clearcuts in both years on one study area and in 1 of 2 years in another study area. The authors suggest that the presence of corridors in the latter study area may have resulted in distance being less influential.<ref name=r16/>\n\nTime since fire is an important factor in Bachman's sparrow habitat use. In Florida, Bachman's sparrows abandoned sites that were greater than 5 years post fire.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Engstrom, R. ToddCrawford, Robert L.Baker, W.

In Missouri glades, reports of average Bachman's sparrow breeding territory range from 1.5 acres (0.62 ha, n=13) to 7 acres (2.9 ha, n=7).<ref name=r10/> In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of central Arkansas, mean home range size (n=25) during the breeding season was 6 acres (2.5 ha).<ref name=r32/> In on a south-central Florida site with saw palmetto and scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia) interspersed amongst threeawn (''Aristida'' spp.), Bachman's sparrow territories (n=6) averaged 12.5 acres (5.1 ha). In winter (November\u2013January), the average home range size of 8 Bachman's sparrows was 1.6 acres (0.65 ha) in the dry prairie of central Florida.<ref name=r14/>\n\nBachman's sparrow density during the breeding season has been estimated in several habitats. On clearcuts of various ages with relatively abundant loblolly pine in eastern Texas, maximum Bachman sparrow density was 1.9/10 ha.<ref name=r5/> In South Carolina, Bachman's sparrow densities ranged from 0 to 0.48/ha across sites of different ages and management regimes.<ref name=r18/> In Georgia, Bachman sparrow densities ranged from 0 to 0.92 birds/ha on sites ranging from an open field to middle-aged and mature forests composed primarily of loblolly pine.<ref name=r28/> In a south-central Florida community composed of saw palmetto, scrub palmetto, and threeawn, Bachman's sparrow density averaged 1 male/33 ha. In dry prairie of central Florida, Bachman's sparrow densities varied from 0.92 to 3.24 territories/10 ha across sites and years.<ref name=r50/> Bachman's sparrow densities calculated from breeding bird censuses in longleaf pine forests was >15 territories/40 ha, while densities from winter bird population studies were from 6 to 10 individuals/40 ha.<ref name=r21>Engstrom, R.

Most nests (70%) were built at the base of bluestem clumps, although nests were found at the base of small trees, forbs, and other grass species.<ref name=r30/> Bachman's sparrow nests are dome-shaped with an opening typically oriented to the north.<ref name=r19/><ref name=\"r45\" /><ref name=r62/><ref name=r31/> However, there is some variation in nest shape and on the Arkansas study site above, only 7% of nests were not either partially or completely domed. Bachman's sparrow nest shape may vary geographically, as nests found farther north in their historic range were infrequently domed.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[avian clutch size|Clutch size]] varies from three to five.<ref name=r45/><ref name=r62/> Average clutch size on a site in Arkansas was 3.9,<ref name=r30/> while in a longleaf pine community in South Carolina mean clutch size was 3.6.<ref name=r63/> Both of these studies found significant (p\u22640.02) decreases in clutch size as the breeding season progressed.<ref name=r63/><ref name=r30/> On a dry prairie site in Florida (n=9) average clutch size was 3.44 and on another (n=5) it was 3.6.<ref name=r50/> In shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of Arkansas, females laid an average of 11.6 eggs (n=20) over the course of the breeding season.<ref name=r30/>\n\nIn shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations in Arkansas, females incubated eggs for 13 to 14 days. The average nestling period was 9 days, and the average period between fledging and independence was 25 days. Both parents care for the young during these periods.<ref name=r30/> A review suggests that Bachman's sparrows probably breed the year after hatching.<ref name=r19/>\n\nBachman's sparrows exhibit some fidelity to breeding sites. Over a two-year period in shortleaf and loblolly pine plantations of central Arkansas, 6 of 34 adults returned to areas where they had a territory in a previous year. This varied across years, with a 29% return rate of adult birds banded in 1983 and none of the adults banded in 1984 returning to the site in 1985. No juveniles (n=60) returned to the site.<ref name=r30/>\n\n===Nesting success===\nValues of nest success reported for Bachman's sparrows vary. Daily nest survival rate of Bachman's sparrow ranged from 0.89 to 0.96 across sites and years in the dry prairie of central Florida. On average 3.13 birds were fledged per successful Bachman's sparrow nest. Estimates of productivity ranged from 1.21 to 4.16 offspring per pair per year across sites and years.<ref name=r50/> In a South Carolina longleaf pine community, daily survival rate of Bachman's sparrow nests in 1995 was 0.952, which was significantly (p=0.04) higher than the 1996 daily nest survival rate of 0.889. Earlier nesting attempts (before June 15, n=15) had significantly (p=0.05) higher survival rates than those started later in the year (n=11). Daily nest survival rate was 0.922 during incubation and 0.973 during the nestling stage.<ref name=r63/> In central Arkansas, daily success rate during the incubation period was 0.965, while in the nestling period it was 0.919.<ref name=r30/> In the glades of south-central Missouri, 8 female Bachman's sparrows fledged an average of 1.5 young per season over 2 years.<ref name=r10/> Predation accounted for 80% of egg loss on study sites in Arkansas<ref name=r30/> and 94% of nest failures on sites in central Florida.<ref name=r50/> Daily survival rates of nests in the Sandhills of North Carolina were 0.947<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fish, Alexander Christopher, author.|title=Effects of Ground-based Military Training on Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) Breeding Ecology|oclc=984128181}}</ref> and 0.951.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Winiarski|first=Jason M.|last2=Fish|first2=Alexander C.|last3=Moorman|first3=Christopher E.|last4=Carpenter|first4=John P.|last5=DePerno|first5=Christopher S.|last6=Schillaci|first6=Jessica M.|date=August 2017|title=Nest-site selection and nest survival of Bachman's Sparrows in two longleaf pine communities|journal=The Condor|volume=119|issue=3|pages=361\u2013374|doi=10.1650/condor-16-220.1|issn=0010-5422}}</ref> Nest survival in North Carolina and South Carolina declined significantly later in the breeding season.<ref name=\"r63\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nInformation on Bachman's sparrow nest predators can be found in the Predators section of this summary.

In Georgia, Bachman's sparrows did not occur in open areas with uniformly dense herbaceous vegetation, despite these sites having a similar volume of vegetation \u22643 feet (1 m) above ground as recently burned pineland sites that were occupied by Bachman's sparrow.<ref name=r28/> Although measurements were not taken, observations of Bachman's sparrow in clearcuts in eastern Texas suggest they may favor tall grass in clumpy rather that uniform distribution.<ref name=r70/> In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, explanations suggested for a lack of evidence of ground layer features influencing selection of breeding territories included importance of habitat characteristics that were not measured, such as patchiness of the [[herbaceous layer]] and species composition.<ref name=r32/> In a predominantly longleaf pine forest in Georgia, Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p=0.04) more abundant in areas where ground cover was primarily Beyrich threeawn (''Aristida beyrichiana''), compared to relatively disturbed communities of bluestems (''Andropogon'' spp.) and silkgrass (''Pityopsis'' spp.).<ref name=r55/>\n\nAmount of litter and debris on a site may influence Bachman's sparrow habitat selection. Percent litter cover was consistently high (>58%) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrow in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina.<ref name=r33/> Although statistical significance was not tested due to small sample size, Bachman's sparrows occurred at higher densities in control plots (1.5 territories/40 ha) than plots that had downed [[coarse woody debris]] >4&nbsp;inches (10&nbsp;cm) in diameter removed (0.4 territories/40 ha) in a loblolly pine forest of South Carolina. Haggerty<ref name=r33/> suggests that litter may provide habitat for Bachman's sparrow prey, but that too much litter could interfere with foraging. In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, litter cover (78%) and depth (0.5&nbsp;inches (1.2&nbsp;cm) on sites occupied by Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p\u22640.01) lower than litter cover (88.9%) and depth (1.6&nbsp;inches (4.2&nbsp;cm)) on unoccupied sites.<ref name=r32/>\n\nBachman's sparrow inhabits areas with open overstories. In sites in eastern Texas of varying age since clearcutting, study areas occupied by Bachman's sparrows had significantly (p<0.01) fewer short (\u2264 10 feet (3m)) and tall (>10 feet (3m)) trees than unoccupied study areas.<ref name=r5/> In longleaf and loblolly pine stands of varying ages and under different management in South Carolina, plots occupied by Bachman's sparrows consistently had low volumes of vegetation from 7 to 13 feet (2\u20134 m) above ground compared to unoccupied sites.<ref name=r18/> In middle-aged and mature forests of Georgia composed primarily of loblolly pine, Bachman sparrow densities were negatively associated with tree/shrub volume and vegetation volume from 7 to <16 feet (3 to <5 m).<ref name=r28>Gobris, Nancy M. 1992. Habitat occupancy during the breeding season by Bachman's Sparrow at Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in central Georgia. Athens, GA: University of Georgia. Thesis</ref> In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, Bachman's sparrow breeding areas had significantly lower percent canopy cover (p<0.001), shorter woody vegetation (p\u22640.01) and fewer trees (p<0.001) and shrubs (p\u22640.05) than unoccupied sites.<ref name=r32/> In south-central Missouri, Bachman's sparrows occurred in glades with less than 30% woody cover, and occupied glades had significantly (p\u22640.05) lower percentages of deciduous and coniferous saplings, deciduous and coniferous trees, and total woody vegetation.<ref name=r10/> Mid-story density was marginally (p=0.055) greater on unoccupied sites, and Bachman's sparrow abundance was significantly (p=0.043) negatively correlated (r= \u20130.446) with mid-story density in longleaf pine woodlands of northwestern Florida. However, relative abundance of Bachman's sparrows was not significantly (p=0.107) associated with canopy cover and there were no significant (p=0.133) differences in canopy cover between occupied and unoccupied sites.<ref name=r52/>\n\nThere is evidence that Bachman sparrow may select sites with some tall vegetation. In north-central Florida, densities of Bachman's sparrows in young (2\u20134 years) slash pine plantations with artificial snags added (n=3) was 31.4 pairs/km\u00b2, while in similar vegetation without snags (n=3) Bachman's sparrow density was 22.3 pairs/km\u00b2 [8]. In an area in South Carolina composed of longleaf and loblolly pine, Bachman's sparrow occurred at significantly (p=0.002) higher density in clearcuts than middle-aged (22\u201350 years) stands, while in another area clearcuts had relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows. Vegetation differences between the 2 sites are likely to explain the difference. The site with relatively low densities of Bachman's sparrows had been drumchopped, which resulted in a lower volume of vegetation from 3 to 7 feet (1\u20132 m) above ground. The authors suggest that the lack of vegetation in this height range may have limited perches, resulting in fewer birds on the site.<ref name=r18/> An investigation of Bachman's sparrow habitat characteristics in 1- to 6-year-old loblolly pine stands of eastern Texas led to recommendations that 2 to 5 tall (>39 feet (12 m)) trees/100 ha remain on a clearcut for Bachman sparrow singing perches.<ref name=r70>Wan Ramle, Wan A.

For a discussion of the possible importance of patchiness of vegetation within a site see the habitat characteristics section.\n\nThe ability of the Bachman's sparrow to detect and colonize areas before they are no longer suitable may depend on the size and isolation of the habitat. In south-central Missouri, only glades \u2265 29 acres (11.7 ha) were occupied by Bachman's sparrows.<ref name=r10/> The probability of Bachman's sparrow occupying pine-grassland restoration stands in Mississippi increased as size of areas with long burning rotations, short-harvest rotations, and no removal of hardwoods decreased (p=0.05) and as the perimeter to area ratio of these areas increased (p=0.02).<ref name=r73/> In South Carolina, distance from source populations significantly (p\u2264 0.05) influenced the ability of Bachman's sparrows to colonize recent clearcuts in both years on one study area and in 1 of 2 years in another study area. The authors suggest that the presence of corridors in the latter study area may have resulted in distance being less influential.<ref name=r16/>\n\nTime since fire is an important factor in Bachman's sparrow habitat use.

Mason|Mason and Rice]].<ref name=\"johnson\"/> In 1891, he won a year's scholarship to study abroad in Europe, where he toured Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium with [[Henry Bacon]], another young architecture student.

This gave better fire protection and allowed large volumes of unobstructed interior. [[Packard|Packard Motor Car Company]]'s [[Packard Automotive Plant|factory]], designed in 1903, was the first to be built according to this principle.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Packard plant no 10 construction.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Packard Automotive Plant]] building no. 10 in construction, c. 1905]]\n\nThe success of the Packard plant interested [[Henry Ford]] in Kahn's designs. Kahn designed [[Ford Motor Company]]'s [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park plant]], begun in 1909, where Ford consolidated production of the [[Ford Model T]] and perfected the [[assembly line]].<ref>Borth, Christy.

The Rouge developed as the largest manufacturing complex in the United States and, in its time, in the world. Its workforce peaked at 120,000 workers.\n\nKahn was responsible for many of the buildings and houses built under direction of the [[Hiram Walker]] family in [[Walkerville, Ontario]], including [[Willistead Manor]]. Kahn's interest in historically styled buildings is also seen in his houses in Detroit's [[Indian Village, Detroit|Indian Village]], the Cranbrook House, the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]], and [[The Dearborn Inn]], the world's first airport hotel.\n\nKahn also designed the 28-story [[Art Deco]] [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, now a landmark and considered one of the most beautiful elements of the Detroit skyline. In 1928, the Fisher building was honored by the [[Architectural League of New York]] as the year's most beautiful commercial structure. Between 1917 and 1929, Kahn designed the headquarters for all three major daily newspapers in Detroit.\n\nOn May 8, 1929, through an agreement signed with Kahn by President of [[Amtorg Trading Corporation|Amtorg]] [[Saul Bron|Saul G. Bron]], the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] contracted the Albert Kahn firm to design the [[Volgograd tractor factory|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]], the first tractor plant in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. On January 9, 1930, a second contract with Kahn was signed for his firm to become consulting architects for all industrial construction in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Rusindustry\"/>\n\nUnder these contracts, during 1929\u20131932, Kahn's firm operated from its headquarters in Detroit and the newly established design bureau in [[Moscow]] to train and supervise Soviet architects and engineers. The bureau ''[[Gosproektstroi]]'' was headed by Albert Kahn's younger brother, [[Moritz Kahn]], and 25 Kahn Associatese staff were involved in Moscow in this  project. They trained more than 4,000 Soviet architects and engineers; and designed 521 plants and factories<ref name=\"johnson\"/> under the [[first five-year plan]].<ref name=\"Rusindustry\">\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Melnikova-Raich|first=Sonia\n |title=The Soviet Problem with Two 'Unknowns': How an American Architect and a Soviet Negotiator Jump-Started the Industrialization of Russia, Part I: Albert Kahn\n |journal=[[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]]|year=2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=59\u201373\n |issn=0160-1040|jstor=41933723}}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Industry's Architect |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,795936,00.html |quote=In 1928 the Soviet Government, after combing the U.S. for a man who could furnish the building brains for Russia's industrialization, offered the job to Kahn.

These include the [[Burton Memorial Tower]], [[Hill Auditorium]], [[University of Michigan Library#Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library|Hatcher Graduate Library]], and [[William L. Clements Library]]. Kahn said later in life that of all the buildings he designed, he wanted most to be remembered for his work on the William L. Clements Library.\n\nKahn frequently collaborated with architectural sculptor [[Corrado Parducci]]. In all, Parducci worked on about 50 Kahn commissions, including banks, office buildings, newspaper buildings, mausoleums, hospitals, and private residences.\n\nKahn's firm was able to adapt to the changing needs of World War I and designed numerous army airfield and naval bases for the United States government during the war. By [[World War II]], Kahn's 600-person office was involved in making Detroit industry part of America's [[Arsenal of Democracy]]. Among others, the office designed the [[Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]], and the [[Willow Run]] Bomber Plant, Kahn's last building, located in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]. The Ford Motor Company mass-produced [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers here.<ref>Borth, Christy.

Kahn designed showrooms for Ford Motor Company in several cities including New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston. He died in Detroit on December 8, 1942.\n\nAs of 2006, approximately 60 Kahn buildings were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Not all of Kahn's works have been preserved.

Mason|Mason and Rice]].<ref name=\"johnson\"/> In 1891, he won a year's scholarship to study abroad in Europe, where he toured Germany, France, Italy, and Belgium with [[Henry Bacon]], another young architecture student.

This gave better fire protection and allowed large volumes of unobstructed interior. [[Packard|Packard Motor Car Company]]'s [[Packard Automotive Plant|factory]], designed in 1903, was the first to be built according to this principle.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=11}}\n\n[[File:Packard plant no 10 construction.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Packard Automotive Plant]] building no. 10 in construction, c. 1905]]\n\nThe success of the Packard plant interested [[Henry Ford]] in Kahn's designs. Kahn designed [[Ford Motor Company]]'s [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park plant]], begun in 1909, where Ford consolidated production of the [[Ford Model T]] and perfected the [[assembly line]].<ref>Borth, Christy.

The Rouge developed as the largest manufacturing complex in the United States and, in its time, in the world. Its workforce peaked at 120,000 workers.\n\nKahn was responsible for many of the buildings and houses built under direction of the [[Hiram Walker]] family in [[Walkerville, Ontario]], including [[Willistead Manor]]. Kahn's interest in historically styled buildings is also seen in his houses in Detroit's [[Indian Village, Detroit|Indian Village]], the Cranbrook House, the [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House]], and [[The Dearborn Inn]], the world's first airport hotel.\n\nKahn also designed the 28-story [[Art Deco]] [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, now a landmark and considered one of the most beautiful elements of the Detroit skyline. In 1928, the Fisher building was honored by the [[Architectural League of New York]] as the year's most beautiful commercial structure. Between 1917 and 1929, Kahn designed the headquarters for all three major daily newspapers in Detroit.\n\nOn May 8, 1929, through an agreement signed with Kahn by President of [[Amtorg Trading Corporation|Amtorg]] [[Saul Bron|Saul G. Bron]], the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] contracted the Albert Kahn firm to design the [[Volgograd tractor factory|Stalingrad Tractor Plant]], the first tractor plant in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. On January 9, 1930, a second contract with Kahn was signed for his firm to become consulting architects for all industrial construction in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Rusindustry\"/>\n\nUnder these contracts, during 1929\u20131932, Kahn's firm operated from its headquarters in Detroit and the newly established design bureau in [[Moscow]] to train and supervise Soviet architects and engineers. The bureau ''[[Gosproektstroi]]'' was headed by Albert Kahn's younger brother, [[Moritz Kahn]], and 25 Kahn Associatese staff were involved in Moscow in this  project. They trained more than 4,000 Soviet architects and engineers; and designed 521 plants and factories<ref name=\"johnson\"/> under the [[first five-year plan]].<ref name=\"Rusindustry\">\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Melnikova-Raich|first=Sonia\n |title=The Soviet Problem with Two 'Unknowns': How an American Architect and a Soviet Negotiator Jump-Started the Industrialization of Russia, Part I: Albert Kahn\n |journal=[[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]]|year=2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=59\u201373\n |issn=0160-1040|jstor=41933723}}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Industry's Architect |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,795936,00.html |quote=In 1928 the Soviet Government, after combing the U.S. for a man who could furnish the building brains for Russia's industrialization, offered the job to Kahn.

These include the [[Burton Memorial Tower]], [[Hill Auditorium]], [[University of Michigan Library#Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library|Hatcher Graduate Library]], and [[William L. Clements Library]]. Kahn said later in life that of all the buildings he designed, he wanted most to be remembered for his work on the William L. Clements Library.\n\nKahn frequently collaborated with architectural sculptor [[Corrado Parducci]]. In all, Parducci worked on about 50 Kahn commissions, including banks, office buildings, newspaper buildings, mausoleums, hospitals, and private residences.\n\nKahn's firm was able to adapt to the changing needs of World War I and designed numerous army airfield and naval bases for the United States government during the war. By [[World War II]], Kahn's 600-person office was involved in making Detroit industry part of America's [[Arsenal of Democracy]]. Among others, the office designed the [[Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]], and the [[Willow Run]] Bomber Plant, Kahn's last building, located in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]. The Ford Motor Company mass-produced [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers here.<ref>Borth, Christy.

At least 36,417 deaths are attributed to the eruption and the [[tsunami]]s it created.\n\nSignificant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano's eruption. Additional [[seismic]] activity continued until February 1884; reports of seismic activity after October 1883 were later dismissed by [[Rogier Verbeek]]'s investigation into the eruption.\n\n==Early phase==\n\nIn the years before the 1883 eruption, seismic activity around the [[Krakatoa]] volcano was intense, with [[earthquake]]s felt as far away as Australia. Beginning on 19 May 1883, steam venting began to occur regularly from [[Perboewatan]], the northernmost of the island's three cones. Eruptions of ash reached an estimated altitude of 6&nbsp;km (20,000&nbsp;ft) and explosions could be heard in New Batavia ([[Jakarta]]) {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref name=\"thornton\">{{cite book |last1=Thornton |first1=Ian W.

On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns could be seen issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption is believed to have been a new vent or vents that formed between Perboewatan and [[Danan]]. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high, and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at [[Anyer]], [[Banten]], and ships began to report large [[pumice]] masses to the west in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\nIn early August, a Dutch topographical engineer, Captain H. J. G. Ferzenaar, investigated the Krakatoa islands.<ref name=\"thornton\"/> He noted three major ash columns (the newer from Danan), which obscured the western part of the island, and steam plumes from at least eleven other vents, mostly between Danan and [[Rakata]]. When he landed, he noted an ash layer about {{convert|0.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} thick, and the destruction of all vegetation, leaving only tree stumps. He advised against any further landings.<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\n==Climactic phase==\nBy 25 August, the Krakatoa eruptions intensified. At about 1:00 pm on 26 August, the volcano went into its [[Volcanic Explosivity Index#Classification|paroxysmal]] phase. By 2:00 pm, a black cloud of ash could be seen 27 kilometres high. At this point, the eruption was almost continuous and explosions could be heard every ten minutes or so. Ships within {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the volcano reported heavy ash fall, with pieces of hot pumice up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter landing on their decks. Between 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm, a small tsunami hit the shores of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.\n\nOn 27 August, four enormous explosions occurred, which marked the climax of the eruption. At 5:30 am, the first explosion was at Perboewatan, triggering a tsunami heading to [[Telukbetung|Telok Betong]], now known as Bandar Lampung. At 6:44{{nbsp}}am, Krakatoa exploded again at Danan, with the resulting tsunami propagating eastward and westward. The third and largest explosion, at 10:02 am, was so violent that it was heard {{convert|3110|km|abbr=on}} away in [[Perth]], Western Australia and the Indian Ocean island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] near [[Mauritius]], {{convert|4800|km|abbr=on}} away, where the blast was thought to have been cannon fire from a nearby ship.

White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue, and sometimes green. People also saw lavender suns and, for the first time, recorded [[noctilucent cloud]]s.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Possible causes==\nThe fate of northern Krakatoa has been the subject of some dispute among geologists. It was originally proposed that the island had been blown apart by the force of the eruption. Most of the material deposited by the volcano is clearly magmatic in origin, and the caldera formed by the eruption is not extensively filled with deposits from the 1883 eruption. This indicates that the island subsided into an empty [[magma chamber]] at the end of the eruption sequence, rather than having been destroyed during the eruptions.\n\nThe established hypotheses \u2013 based on the findings of contemporary investigators \u2013 assume that part of the island subsided before the first explosions on the morning of 27 August. This forced the volcano's vents to be below sea level, causing:\n*major flooding which created a series of [[Phreatic eruption|phreatic explosions]] (interaction of ground water and magma).\n*seawater to cool the [[magma]] enough for it to crust over and produce a \"pressure cooker\" effect that was relieved only when explosive pressures were reached.\n\nThere is geological evidence which does not support the assumption that only subsidence before the explosion was the cause. For instance, the pumice and ignimbrite deposits are not of a kind consistent with a magma-seawater interaction. These findings have led to other hypotheses: \n*an underwater land slump or partial subsidence suddenly exposed the highly pressurized magma chamber, opening a pathway for seawater to enter the magma chamber and setting the stage for a magma-seawater interaction.\n*the final explosions may have been caused by [[Igneous differentiation#Magma mixing|magma mixing]]: a sudden infusion of hot basaltic magma into the cooler and lighter magma in the chamber below the volcano. This would have resulted in a rapid and unsustainable increase in pressure, leading to a cataclysmic explosion. Evidence for this theory is the existence of pumice consisting of light and dark material, the dark material being of much hotter origin. Such material reportedly is less than five per cent of the content of the Krakatoa ignimbrite and some investigators have rejected this as a prime cause of the 27 August explosions.\n[[File:KrakatoaHV.webm|thumb|Numerical model of hydrovolcanic explosion of Krakatoa and Tsunami generation]]\nA numerical model for a Krakatoa hydrovolcanic explosion and the resulting tsunami was described by [[Charles L. Mader|Mader]] & Gittings, in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mader|first=Charles L.|last2=Gittings|first2=Michael L.|year=2006|title= Numerical model for the Krakatoa hydrovolcanic explosion and tsunami|journal = Science of Tsunami Hazards|volume=24|issue=3|pages=174\u2013182|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38105928 }}</ref> A high wall of water is formed that is initially higher than 100 metres driven by the shocked water, basalt and air.\n\n==Verbeek investigation==\nAlthough the violent phase of the 1883 eruption was over by late afternoon of 27 August, after light returned by 29 August, reports continued for months that Krakatoa was still in eruption. One of the earliest duties of Verbeek's committee was to determine if this was true and also verify reports of other volcanoes erupting on Java and Sumatra. In general, these were found to be false, and Verbeek discounted any claims of Krakatoa still erupting after mid-October as due to steaming of hot material, landslides due to heavy monsoon rains that season, and \"hallucinations due to electrical activity\" seen from a distance.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nNo signs of further activity were seen until 1913, when an eruption was reported. Investigation could find no evidence the volcano was awakening, and it was determined that what had been mistaken for renewed activity had actually been a major landslide (possibly the one which formed the second arc to Rakata's cliff).\n\nExaminations after 1930 of [[bathymetric]] charts made in 1919 show evidence of a bulge indicative of [[magma]] near the surface at the site that became [[Krakatoa#Anak Krakatau|Anak Krakatau]].\n\n==Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ <big>Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions {{citation needed|date = December 2018}}</big>\n|-\n!

On 24 June, a prevailing east wind cleared the cloud, and two ash columns could be seen issuing from Krakatoa. The seat of the eruption is believed to have been a new vent or vents that formed between Perboewatan and [[Danan]]. The violence of the ongoing eruptions caused tides in the vicinity to be unusually high, and ships at anchor had to be moored with chains. Earthquakes were felt at [[Anyer]], [[Banten]], and ships began to report large [[pumice]] masses to the west in the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\nIn early August, a Dutch topographical engineer, Captain H.

He advised against any further landings.<ref name=\"thornton\"/>\n\n==Climactic phase==\nBy 25 August, the Krakatoa eruptions intensified. At about 1:00 pm on 26 August, the volcano went into its [[Volcanic Explosivity Index#Classification|paroxysmal]] phase. By 2:00 pm, a black cloud of ash could be seen 27 kilometres high. At this point, the eruption was almost continuous and explosions could be heard every ten minutes or so. Ships within {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the volcano reported heavy ash fall, with pieces of hot pumice up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter landing on their decks. Between 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm, a small tsunami hit the shores of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]], {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.\n\nOn 27 August, four enormous explosions occurred, which marked the climax of the eruption. At 5:30 am, the first explosion was at Perboewatan, triggering a tsunami heading to [[Telukbetung|Telok Betong]], now known as Bandar Lampung. At 6:44{{nbsp}}am, Krakatoa exploded again at Danan, with the resulting tsunami propagating eastward and westward.

White moonbeams shining through the clouds emerged blue, and sometimes green. People also saw lavender suns and, for the first time, recorded [[noctilucent cloud]]s.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Possible causes==\nThe fate of northern Krakatoa has been the subject of some dispute among geologists. It was originally proposed that the island had been blown apart by the force of the eruption. Most of the material deposited by the volcano is clearly magmatic in origin, and the caldera formed by the eruption is not extensively filled with deposits from the 1883 eruption. This indicates that the island subsided into an empty [[magma chamber]] at the end of the eruption sequence, rather than having been destroyed during the eruptions.\n\nThe established hypotheses \u2013 based on the findings of contemporary investigators \u2013 assume that part of the island subsided before the first explosions on the morning of 27 August. This forced the volcano's vents to be below sea level, causing:\n*major flooding which created a series of [[Phreatic eruption|phreatic explosions]] (interaction of ground water and magma).\n*seawater to cool the [[magma]] enough for it to crust over and produce a \"pressure cooker\" effect that was relieved only when explosive pressures were reached.\n\nThere is geological evidence which does not support the assumption that only subsidence before the explosion was the cause. For instance, the pumice and ignimbrite deposits are not of a kind consistent with a magma-seawater interaction. These findings have led to other hypotheses: \n*an underwater land slump or partial subsidence suddenly exposed the highly pressurized magma chamber, opening a pathway for seawater to enter the magma chamber and setting the stage for a magma-seawater interaction.\n*the final explosions may have been caused by [[Igneous differentiation#Magma mixing|magma mixing]]: a sudden infusion of hot basaltic magma into the cooler and lighter magma in the chamber below the volcano. This would have resulted in a rapid and unsustainable increase in pressure, leading to a cataclysmic explosion. Evidence for this theory is the existence of pumice consisting of light and dark material, the dark material being of much hotter origin. Such material reportedly is less than five per cent of the content of the Krakatoa ignimbrite and some investigators have rejected this as a prime cause of the 27 August explosions.\n[[File:KrakatoaHV.webm|thumb|Numerical model of hydrovolcanic explosion of Krakatoa and Tsunami generation]]\nA numerical model for a Krakatoa hydrovolcanic explosion and the resulting tsunami was described by [[Charles L.

One of the earliest duties of Verbeek's committee was to determine if this was true and also verify reports of other volcanoes erupting on Java and Sumatra. In general, these were found to be false, and Verbeek discounted any claims of Krakatoa still erupting after mid-October as due to steaming of hot material, landslides due to heavy monsoon rains that season, and \"hallucinations due to electrical activity\" seen from a distance.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nNo signs of further activity were seen until 1913, when an eruption was reported. Investigation could find no evidence the volcano was awakening, and it was determined that what had been mistaken for renewed activity had actually been a major landslide (possibly the one which formed the second arc to Rakata's cliff).\n\nExaminations after 1930 of [[bathymetric]] charts made in 1919 show evidence of a bulge indicative of [[magma]] near the surface at the site that became [[Krakatoa#Anak Krakatau|Anak Krakatau]].\n\n==Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|+ <big>Comparison of selected volcanic eruptions {{citation needed|date = December 2018}}</big>\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Article One of the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{short description|Portion of the US Constitution regarding Congress}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{wikisource|Constitution of the United States of America#Article I|Article 1\n of the United States Constitution}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\n'''Article One of the United States Constitution''' establishes the [[Legislature|legislative branch]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], the [[United States Congress]]. Under Article One, Congress is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Article One grants Congress various [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] and the ability to pass laws \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the butt procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of Congress and the [[U.S. state|states]].\n\nArticle One's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the Vesting Clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes various rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out various other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the [[Vice President of the United States]] as the president of the Senate.\n\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the [[List of United States presidential vetoes|veto power]] of the [[President of the United States]]. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to [[Taxing and Spending Clause|lay and collect taxes and tariffs]] for the \"general welfare\" of the United States, the power to borrow money, the power to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate and international commerce]], the power to set [[United States nationality law|naturalization laws]], the power to coin and regulate money, the power to establish [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the power to raise and support military forces, and the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. Section 8 also provides Congress the power to establish a [[Washington, D.C.|federal district]] to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to various enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places various limits on the power of Congress, banning [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, [[Contract Clause|impairing contracts]], [[Import-Export Clause|taxing imports or exports]] above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress==\n{{main|Vesting Clauses}}\n[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|Opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] in the House of Representatives chamber, January 5, 2011]]\n{{quote|All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.}}\n\nSection 1 is a [[Vesting Clauses|vesting clause]] that bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|II]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|III]]. The former confers [[Executive (government)|executive]] power upon the President alone, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. This separation of powers, by which each department may exercise only its own constitutional powers and no others,<ref>''See Atkins v. United States'', 556 F.2d 1028, 1062 (Ct. Cl. 1977) (\"The purpose of the [Vesting C]lause is to locate the central source of legislative authority in Congress, rather than the Executive or the Judiciary.\"), ''abrogated on other grounds by [[INS v. Chadha]]'', 462 U.S. 919 (1983).</ref><ref>See ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States]]'', 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928) (\"Our Federal Constitution... divide[s] the governmental power into three branches. The first is the legislative, the second is the executive, and the third is judicial, and the rule is that in the actual administration of the government Congress... should exercise the legislative power, the President... the executive power, and the courts or the judiciary the judicial power....\")</ref> is fundamental to the idea of a limited government accountable to the people.\n\nThe separation of powers principle is particularly noteworthy in regard to the Congress. The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers \"herein granted\" within Article I (as later limited by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]).<ref>See ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', 514 U.S. 549, 592 (1995) (\"[Certain] comments of Hamilton and others about federal power reflected the well-known truth that the new Government would have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the Constitution.... Even before the passage of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], it was apparent that Congress would possess only those powers 'herein granted' by the rest of the Constitution.\").</ref> It also, by implied extension, prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the [[nondelegation doctrine]].<ref>See ''[[Touby v. the United States]]'', 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991) (\"From th[e language of this section of the Constitution] the Court has derived the nondelegation doctrine: that Congress may not constitutionally delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government.\").</ref> However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have the latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an \"intelligible principle\" which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority.<ref>See ''J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co.'', 276 U.S. at 409 (\"If Congress shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [administer a statutory scheme] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.\").</ref> That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Douglas H.|title=Essays on Article I: Legislative Vesting Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/2/legislative-vesting-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly,<ref>See ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'', 488 U.S. 361, 373 n.7 (1989) (nondelegation doctrine takes the form of \"giving narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be thought to be unconstitutional\").</ref> in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to \"test the waters\" of what the courts would allow it to do.<ref>''UAW v. Occupational Health & Safety Admin.'', 938 F.2d 1310, 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (\"In effect [the nondelegation doctrine as a principle of statutory interpretation is used by the courts to] require a clear statement by Congress that it intended to test the constitutional waters.\"); cf. ''[[Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council]]'', 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (\"[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.... This approach not only reflects the prudential concern that constitutional issues not be needlessly confronted, but also recognizes that Congress, like this Court, is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the Constitution. The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it.\" (citing ''[[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop]]'', 440 U.S. 490, 499\u2013501, 504 (1979), and ''[[Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden]]'', 112 U.S. 261 (1884))); ''[[United States v. Bass]]'', 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971) (\"[U]nless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.\").</ref>\n\nAlthough not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation.<ref>''[[Barenblatt v.

To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a [[United States Census|census]] be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e. [[slave]]s), but excluding non-taxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This Constitutional rule, known as the [[three-fifths compromise]], was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for [[enumeration]] purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] (writing in [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|1833]]), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2:\u00a7\u00a7 630\u201335, 641\u201347, 673\u201380|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_2_3s22.html|website=The Founder's Constitution|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=Volume 2, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, Document 22|page=\u00a7677|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<ref name=prigg>Cf.

To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income \"from whatever source derived\" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 2, Clause 4}}Clause 4: Vacancies===\n{{quote|When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.}}\n\nSection two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement, but the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling.

It ends by temporarily [[Entrenched clause#United States|shielding]] three Article I clauses from being amended. This clause is among them. (The others are first and fourth clauses in Section 9.) Article Five provides that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Thus, no individual state may have its individual representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent. That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\n\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their [[Equal footing|equality]] in the Senate would, according to [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] (in ''[[Texas v. White]]''), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the [[District of Columbia]] full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the States are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right.

This was done in May 1789 [[Sortition|by lot]]. It was also decided that each state's Senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\n\nAs originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators===\n{{quote|No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.}}\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial.<ref>See ''Nixon'', 506 U.S. at 230\u201331, 233\u201336 (holding that the Senate's sole power to try impeachments made its judgment conclusive as to what constituted an adequate impeachment trial) (\"We think that the word 'sole' is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' \"''sole'' Power of Impeachment.\" The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted.

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe constitution's framers vested the Senate with this power for several reasons. First, they believed Senators would be better educated, more virtuous, and more high-minded than Members of the House of Representatives and thus uniquely able to decide responsibly the most difficult of political questions. Second, they believed that the Senate, being a numerous body, would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an impeachment trial, in which it, unlike judges and the judiciary system, would \"never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutor, or in the construction of it by judges, as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.\" (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 65).<ref name=Gerhardt>{{cite web|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Michael J.|title=Essay on Trial of Impeachment|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three Constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials.  The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion.  The stipulation that the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the President and Vice President it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.<ref name=Gerhardt/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction===\n{{quote|Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.}}\n\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future.

First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government, not with the executive or judicial.<ref name=APessay>{{cite web|last1=Peacock|first1=Anthony|title=Essays on Article I: Election Regulations|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/19/election-regulations|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>See ''[[Foster v.

'[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.' The Clause gives Congress 'comprehensive' authority to regulate the details of elections, including the power to impose 'the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved.' Congressional authority extends not only to general elections, but also to any 'primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress.')

As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\"<ref>''[[Cook v.

Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<ref>{{USC|2|2c}} (2006).</ref> The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include voters using the [[Direct democracy|initiative process]], in those states whose constitutions provide it, to create an independent [[redistricting commission]].<ref>''See [[Arizona State Legislature v.

The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s]] guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]], and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.<ref name=USC-A&I/>\n\nBeginning with the [[Tillman Act of 1907]], Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|elections and campaign financing]]. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, ''[[Buckley v.

The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the [[suffrage|right to vote]] on the basis of sex; the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax; and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 4, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Sessions of Congress===\n{{quote|The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.}}\n\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress|Article II, Section 3]] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. [[Nathaniel Gorham]] of [[Massachusetts]] argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article I: Meetings of Congress Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/20/meetings-of-congress-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\".

For instance, the Senate once admitted [[John Eaton (politician)|John Henry Eaton]], a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time).

Members attending, going to or returning from either House are privileged from arrest, except for [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[breach of the peace]]. One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander occurring during Congressional debate, nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. The latter was affirmed when [[Mike Gravel]] published over 4,000 pages of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in ''[[Gravel v. United States]]'', 408 U.S. 606 (1972) to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress, so long as their activities relate to legislative matters.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 6, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Independence from the executive===\n{{Main|Ineligibility Clause}}\n{{See also|Saxbe fix}}\n{{quote|No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.}}\nSenators and Representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch. This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using [[patronage]] to buy votes in Congress.<ref name=\"Calabresi\" /> It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nFurthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the [[Saxbe fix]]). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator [[Hugo Black]] was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 7}}Section 7: Bills==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Bills of revenue===\n{{main|Origination Clause|l1=Bills of Revenue}}\n{{quote|All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.}}\nThis establishes the method for making [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that involve taxation.

This practice was intended to ensure that the [[power of the purse]]  is possessed by the legislative body most responsive to the people, although the English practice was modified in America by allowing the Senate to amend these bills. The clause was part of the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] between small and large states; the large states were unhappy with the lopsided power of small states in the Senate, and so the clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, and compensates the large states for allowing equal voting rights to Senators from small states.<ref>Jensen, Erik and Monaghan, Henry.

If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.}}\nThis clause is known as the [[Presentment Clause]]. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the [[veto]], although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"[[pocket veto]]\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"<ref>See Ross Wilson, A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1593862</ref>\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In ''[[Wright v. United States]]'' (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Presidential veto===\n{{quote|Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.}}\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996|Line Item Veto Act]], which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].\n\nSome Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. [[Grover Cleveland]], for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including [[pocket veto]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/BushGW.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt; Statistics &amp; Lists &gt; Vetoes by President George W.

Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American [[welfare state#United States|welfare state]] as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. [[James Madison]], who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution.  While he was President of the United States, Madison [[veto]]ed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to [[Internal improvements|build infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Madison - Veto of federal public works bill of March 3, 1817|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105014440/http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2018|accessdate= November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |title=Excerpt from James Madison\u2019s Veto Message: March 3, 1817 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430011150/https://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf Presidential Vetoes, 1789\u20131988, p. 34]</ref>\n\n===Clause 1: the General Welfare Clause===\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title= |url=https://constitutionallawreporter.com/taxing-and-spending-clause/|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the [[political question]] to Congress. In ''[[United States v. Butler]]'' (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]; for instance, the [[social security]] program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\n===Clause 2: Borrowing Power===\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding ''[[Knox v. Lee]],'' the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.<ref>See ''e.g.'' Perry v. United States, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137 294 U.S. 330 (1935).]</ref>\n\n===Clause 3: Commerce Clause===\n[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.]]\n{{Main|Commerce Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;}}\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the ''[[commerce clause]]'' for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: [[Thomas Gibbons (politician)|Thomas Gibbons]] had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the [[Hudson River]], while the other, [[Aaron Ogden]], had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitude dominated the Court. In ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Company]]'' (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled [[New Deal]] programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company]]'', that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"[[unfair labor practice]]s\" such as firing workers for joining [[labor union|unions]]. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', the Court ruled that production quotas under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of [[handgun]]s, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by ''Wickard v. Filburn''. In ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] even where states approve its use for [[medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]]. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\n===Clause 18: Implied Powers of Congress===\n====Other powers of Congress====\n[[File:USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) underway in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2 November 1964.jpg|thumb| alt=Aircraft carrier at sea.|Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']].]]\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to [[naturalization]] and [[bankruptcy]]. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish [[Postal Clause|post offices and post roads]] (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting [[United States copyright law|copyrights]] and [[United States patent law|patents]] of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the [[Copyright Clause]], is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<ref>[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]] (1996). The fire of invention, the fuel of interest: On intellectual property. Washington D.C.: The American Enterprise Institute Press.</ref> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the [[War Powers Clause]], only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against [[Pancho Villa]] constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] and [[reprisal]]. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the [[Feres v. United States|Feres Doctrine]].\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\n====Necessary and Proper====\n{{Main|Necessary and Proper Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.}}\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in ''Wickard v. Filburn''; however, [[Thomas Jefferson]], in the [[Kentucky Resolutions]], supported by [[James Madison]], maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[piracy]] and [[felony]] on the [[high seas]], and offenses against the [[law of nations]].\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), which involved the establishment of a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing ''all'' of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as [[implied powers]]) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 9}}Section 9: Limits on Congress==\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\n{{quote|The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of ''[[wiktionary:habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nNo [[Bill of attainder]] or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\nNo [[Poll tax|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\n\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\n\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, [[wiktionary:emolument#Noun|Emolument]], Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.}}\n\n===Clause 1: Slave trade===\n[[File:Africa and the American Flag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|U.S. brig ''[[USS Perry (1843)|Perry]]'' confronting the slave ship ''Martha'' off [[Ambriz]] on June 6, 1850]]\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[slave trade|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808.  Congress could however, levy a ''[[per capita]]'' duty of up to ten [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollars]] for each slave imported into the country.  This clause was further [[entrenched clause#United States|entrenched]] into the Constitution by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.  On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the United States, which went into effect January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution.\n\n===Clauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections===\nA writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA [[bill of attainder]] is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An ''[[ex post facto]]'' law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The ''ex post facto'' clause does not apply to civil matters.<ref>[[Calder v. Bull]], 3 U.S. 386, 399-400 (1798).</ref>\n\n===Clauses 4-7: Apportionment of direct taxes===\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from [[#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Section Two, Clause 3]] that [[direct taxes]] must be apportioned by state populations.  This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].  In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] exempted all [[income taxes]] from this clause. This overcame the ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]]s authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\n===Clause 8: Titles of nobility===\n{{main|Title of Nobility Clause}}\nThe [[Title of Nobility Clause]] prohibits Congress from granting any [[nobility|title of nobility]]. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state.  Emoluments were a profound concern of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|the Founders]].<ref name=impeachable-offenses>{{cite magazine|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah|authorlink1=Noah Feldman|last2=Weisberg|first2=Jacob|authorlink2=Jacob Weisberg|title=What Are Impeachable Offenses?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/donald-trump-impeachable-offenses|magazine=The New York Review of Books|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 10}}Section 10: Limits on the States==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Contracts Clause===\n{{further|Contract Clause|Bills of Credit}}\n{{quote|No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.}}\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue [[bills of credit]] (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/110/421/case.html ''Juilliard v. Greenman''], 110 U.S. 421, 446 (1884).</ref>) from \"making a tender\" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender%5B5%5D Definition of '''tender''' as noun, in Merriam-Webster].

Federal Reserve Bank''<ref>262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923). See also ''[[Gwin v. Breedlove]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844); and ''[[Griffin v. Thompson]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844).</ref>). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist no. 44]]'', Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\".<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s5.html Madison, James ''Federalist Papers No. 44'']</ref> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ''ex post facto'' laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Contract Clause]] was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' was decided. The case involved the [[Yazoo land scandal]], in which the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature<!--which was basically all of them-->. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' involved [[Dartmouth College]], which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, [[New Hampshire]] passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]''. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In ''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws ''could'' apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal bankruptcy law]] in 1898.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Import-Export Clause===\n{{main|Import-Export Clause}}\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's{{sic}}<!-- Please do not remove the apostrophe in \"it's\".

States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Compact Clause===\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.}}\n\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace. They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states, nor engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. (Article I, Section 8, enumerated powers of Congress.) The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose members are also members of the [[Militia (United States)|militia of the United States]] as defined by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in [[State Defense Forces|State Militias]] with federal oversight under {{UnitedStatesCode|32|109}}.\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to [[the Crown]] for approval. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an [[interstate compact]].  In ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".<ref>{{cite book |title=American Constitutional Law|last=Tribe |first=Laurence | authorlink=Laurence Tribe |year=2000 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=1-56662-714-1 |pages=649\u201351}}</ref> The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet [[Coming into force|effective]] [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] entered into by fifteen states plus the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=Michael|title=Circumventing the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Survives Constitutional Scrutiny Under the Compact Clause|journal=Legislation and Policy Brief|date=February 17, 2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40ff|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=lpb|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ American University Washington College of Law}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Peter H.

Under Article One, Congress is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Article One grants Congress various [[Enumerated powers (United States)|enumerated powers]] and the ability to pass laws \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]\" to carry out those powers. Article One also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of Congress and the [[U.S. state|states]].\n\nArticle One's [[Vesting Clauses|Vesting Clause]] grants all federal legislative power to Congress and establishes that Congress consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. In combination with the Vesting Clauses of Article Two and Article Three, the Vesting Clause of Article One establishes the [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the federal government. Section 2 of Article One addresses the House of Representatives, establishing that members of the House are elected every two years, with congressional seats apportioned to the states on the basis of population. Section 2 includes various rules for the House of Representatives, including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state's legislature have the right to vote in elections for the House of Representatives. Section 3 addresses the Senate, establishing that the Senate consists of two senators from each state, with each senator serving a six-year term. Section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the Senate, but the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], ratified in 1913, provides for the direct election of senators. Section 3 lays out various other rules for the Senate, including a provision that establishes the [[Vice President of the United States]] as the president of the Senate.\n\nSection 4 of Article One grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process but establishes that Congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations. Section 4 also requires Congress to assemble at least once per year. Section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of Congress and grants the House of Representatives and the Senate the power to judge their own elections, determine the qualifications of their own members, and punish or expel their own members. Section 6 establishes the compensation, privileges, and restrictions of those holding congressional office. Section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill, requiring both houses of Congress to pass a bill for it to become law, subject to the [[List of United States presidential vetoes|veto power]] of the [[President of the United States]]. Under Section 7, the president can veto a bill, but Congress can override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote of both chambers.\n\nSection 8 lays out the powers of Congress. It includes several enumerated powers, including the power to [[Taxing and Spending Clause|lay and collect taxes and tariffs]] for the \"general welfare\" of the United States, the power to borrow money, the power to [[Commerce Clause|regulate interstate and international commerce]], the power to set [[United States nationality law|naturalization laws]], the power to coin and regulate money, the power to establish [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]] inferior to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the power to raise and support military forces, and the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. Section 8 also provides Congress the power to establish a [[Washington, D.C.|federal district]] to serve as the national capital and gives Congress the exclusive power to administer that district. In addition to various enumerated powers, Section 8 grants Congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its enumerated powers and other powers vested in it. Section 9 places various limits on the power of Congress, banning [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]] and other practices. Section 10 places limits on the states, prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers, [[Contract Clause|impairing contracts]], [[Import-Export Clause|taxing imports or exports]] above the minimum level necessary for inspection, keeping armies, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 1}}Section 1: Legislative power vested in Congress==\n{{main|Vesting Clauses}}\n[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|Opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] in the House of Representatives chamber, January 5, 2011]]\n{{quote|All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.}}\n\nSection 1 is a [[Vesting Clauses|vesting clause]] that bestows federal [[Legislation|legislative]] power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|II]] and [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|III]]. The former confers [[Executive (government)|executive]] power upon the President alone, and the latter grants [[Judiciary|judicial]] power solely to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a [[separation of powers]] among the three branches of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. This separation of powers, by which each department may exercise only its own constitutional powers and no others,<ref>''See Atkins v. United States'', 556 F.2d 1028, 1062 (Ct. Cl. 1977) (\"The purpose of the [Vesting C]lause is to locate the central source of legislative authority in Congress, rather than the Executive or the Judiciary.\"), ''abrogated on other grounds by [[INS v.

The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers \"herein granted\" within Article I (as later limited by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]).<ref>See ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', 514 U.S. 549, 592 (1995) (\"[Certain] comments of Hamilton and others about federal power reflected the well-known truth that the new Government would have only the limited and enumerated powers found in the Constitution....

The courts will therefore not lightly assume that Congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it.\" (citing ''[[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop]]'', 440 U.S. 490, 499\u2013501, 504 (1979), and ''[[Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden]]'', 112 U.S. 261 (1884))); ''[[United States v.

United States]]'', 360 U.S. 109, 111 (1959) (\"The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate.\"); e.g., 3 {{smallcaps|Annals of Congress}} 490\u201394 (1792) (House committee appointed to investigate the defeat of Gen. St. Clair by Indians empowered to \"call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.\").</ref> The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate.<ref>See ''[[McGrain v. Daugherty]]'', 273 U.S. 135, 174\u201375 (1927) (\"[T]he power of inquiry-with process to enforce it-is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. It was so regarded and employed in American Legislatures before the Constitution was framed and ratified.... A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information-which not infrequently is true-recourse must be had to others who do possess it. Experience has taught that mere requests for such information often are unavailing, and also that information which is volunteered is not always accurate or complete; so some means of compulsion are essential to obtain what is needed. All this was true before and when the Constitution was framed and adopted. In that period the power of inquiry, with enforcing process, was regarded and employed as a necessary and appropriate attribute of the power to legislate-indeed, was treated as inhering in it. Thus there is ample warrant for thinking... that the constitutional provisions which commit the legislative function to the two houses are intended to include this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively exercised.\").</ref> Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate.<ref name=\"investigate\">See ''[[Watkins v. United States]]'', 354 U.S. 178, 187 (1957) (\"The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad.

To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a [[United States Census|census]] be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e. [[slave]]s), but excluding non-taxed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This Constitutional rule, known as the [[three-fifths compromise]], was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for [[enumeration]] purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Joseph Story]] (writing in [[Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States|1833]]), a \"matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution 2:\u00a7\u00a7 630\u201335, 641\u201347, 673\u201380|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_2_3s22.html|website=The Founder's Constitution|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=Volume 2, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, Document 22|page=\u00a7677|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<ref name=prigg>Cf.

Thus, for example, although the constitution has declared, that representatives shall be apportioned among the states according to their respective federal numbers; and for this purpose, it has expressly authorized congress, by law, to provide for an enumeration of the population every ten years; yet the power to apportion representatives, after this enumeration is made, is nowhere found among the express powers given to congress, but it has always been acted upon, as irresistibly flowing from the duty positively enjoined by the constitution.\").</ref> and to allocate a particular number of representatives to each state according to its share of the national population.\n\nSince enactment of the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]], a constant 435 House seats have been apportioned among the states according to each census, and determining the size of the House is not presently part of the apportionment process.

That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could become valid as part of the Constitution if ratified by three-fourths of the states; however, one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area), would require the unanimous consent of all the states.\n\nDenying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by abolishing their [[Equal footing|equality]] in the Senate would, according to [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] (in ''[[Texas v. White]]''), destroy the grounding of the Union. This Article V provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the [[District of Columbia]] full representation in the Congress without also granting it statehood. Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph Rossum|title=Essays on Article V: Prohibition on Amendment: Equal Suffrage in the Senate|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/5/essays/131/prohibition-on-amendment-equal-suffrage-in-the-senate|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> Those in favor of the amendment have argued that the States are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another, and that granting the federal district Senate representation does not violate that right. Whether unanimous consent of the 50 states would be required for such an amendment to [[Coming into force|become operative]] remains an unanswered political question.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Classification of Senators; Vacancies===\n{{quote|Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.}}\n\nAfter the first group of Senators was elected to the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] (1789\u20131791), the Senators were divided into [[Classes of United States Senators|three \"classes\"]] as nearly equal in size as possible, as required by this section. This was done in May 1789 [[Sortition|by lot]]. It was also decided that each state's Senators would be assigned to two different classes. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).\n\nAs originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]], which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators===\n{{quote|No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.}}\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State they will represent at the time of the election.

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to mean that the Senate has exclusive and unreviewable authority to determine what constitutes an adequate impeachment trial.<ref>See ''Nixon'', 506 U.S. at 230\u201331, 233\u201336 (holding that the Senate's sole power to try impeachments made its judgment conclusive as to what constituted an adequate impeachment trial) (\"We think that the word 'sole' is of considerable significance. Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' \"''sole'' Power of Impeachment.\" The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted. The dictionary definition bears this out.... The history and contemporary understanding of the impeachment provisions support our reading of the constitutional language.... [T]he Judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments.... [J]udicial review would be inconsistent with the Framers' insistence that our system be one of checks and balances.... Judicial involvement in impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of judicial review, is counterintuitive because it would eviscerate the 'important constitutional check' placed on the Judiciary by the Framers.

On one occasion (in the case of Senator [[William Blount]] in 1797) the Senate declined to hold a trial, asserting that the House had no jurisdiction over members of the Senate; in any case, Blount had already been expelled from the Senate.<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/impeach.html Impeachment History].

Rehnquist|Chief Justice William Rehnquist]] presiding]]\n\nThe constitution's framers vested the Senate with this power for several reasons. First, they believed Senators would be better educated, more virtuous, and more high-minded than Members of the House of Representatives and thus uniquely able to decide responsibly the most difficult of political questions. Second, they believed that the Senate, being a numerous body, would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an impeachment trial, in which it, unlike judges and the judiciary system, would \"never be tied down by such strict rules, either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutor, or in the construction of it by judges, as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security.\" (Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist No. 65).<ref name=Gerhardt>{{cite web|last1=Gerhardt|first1=Michael J.|title=Essay on Trial of Impeachment|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/17/trial-of-impeachment|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three Constitutionally mandated requirements for impeachment trials.  The provision that Senators must sit on oath or affirmation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion.  The stipulation that the [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] is to preside over presidential impeachment trials underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency. The latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the Constitution was adopted, and with the original method of electing the President and Vice President it was presumed that the two people elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals. The specification that a two-thirds super-majority vote of those Senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious deliberation and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across factional divisions.<ref name=Gerhardt/>\n\n==={{anchor|Section 3, Clause 7}}Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction===\n{{quote|Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.}}\n\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office, and may be barred from holding any public office in the future.

First, it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal Senators and Representatives. That responsibility lies primarily with the states and secondarily with Congress. Second, the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government, not with the executive or judicial.<ref name=APessay>{{cite web|last1=Peacock|first1=Anthony|title=Essays on Article I: Election Regulations|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/19/election-regulations|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref><ref>See ''[[Foster v.

'[T]he regulations made by Congress are paramount to those made by the State legislature; and if they conflict therewith, the latter, so far as the conflict extends, ceases to be operative.' The Clause gives Congress 'comprehensive' authority to regulate the details of elections, including the power to impose 'the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved.' Congressional authority extends not only to general elections, but also to any 'primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as representatives in Congress.')

As for regulating the \"manner\" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean \"matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns.\"<ref>''[[Cook v.

Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<ref>{{USC|2|2c}} (2006).</ref> The Supreme Court has interpreted \"by the Legislature thereof\" to include voters using the [[Direct democracy|initiative process]], in those states whose constitutions provide it, to create an independent [[redistricting commission]].<ref>''See [[Arizona State Legislature v.

The act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a Senator was selected. The first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s]] guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights. Under the [[Enforcement Act of 1870]], and subsequent laws, false registration, bribery, voting without legal right, making false returns of votes cast, interference in any manner with officers of election, and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses. Provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawfully, to witness the counting of votes, and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets.<ref name=USC-A&I/>\n\nBeginning with the [[Tillman Act of 1907]], Congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|elections and campaign financing]]. The most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. It was this legislation that was at issue in the Supreme Court's seminal decision, ''[[Buckley v.

The Seventeenth Amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of Senators; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states. Also, the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] prohibits any U.S. citizen from being denied the [[suffrage|right to vote]] on the basis of sex; the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other types of tax; and the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to U.S. citizens who are at least eighteen years old.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 4, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Sessions of Congress===\n{{quote|The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.}}\n\nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution empowers Congress to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress|Article II, Section 3]] does grant the president limited authority to convene and adjourn both Houses (or either of them) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to enact legislation on behalf of the people. Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. [[Nathaniel Gorham]] of [[Massachusetts]] argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Essays on Article I: Meetings of Congress Clause|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/20/meetings-of-congress-clause|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nAlthough this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December, the government established by the 1787 Constitution did not begin operations until March 4, 1789. As the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] held its initial meeting on March 4, that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=March 4: A forgotten huge day in American history|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/03/march-4-a-forgotten-huge-day-in-american-politics/|publisher=[[National Constitution Center]]|location=Philadelphia|date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Therefore, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a \"[[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]\" session convening in the interim. This practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], which states (in Section 2) that, \"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day\".

For instance, the Senate once admitted [[John Eaton (politician)|John Henry Eaton]], a twenty-eight-year-old, in 1818 (the admission was inadvertent, as Eaton's birth date was unclear at the time). In 1934, a twenty-nine-year-old, [[Rush D. Holt Sr.|Rush Holt]], was elected to the Senate; he agreed to wait six months, until his thirtieth birthday, to take the oath.

Members attending, going to or returning from either House are privileged from arrest, except for [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[breach of the peace]]. One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander occurring during Congressional debate, nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. The latter was affirmed when [[Mike Gravel]] published over 4,000 pages of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', which might have otherwise been a criminal offense. This clause has also been interpreted in ''[[Gravel v. United States]]'', 408 U.S. 606 (1972) to provide protection to aides and staff of sitting members of Congress, so long as their activities relate to legislative matters.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 6, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Independence from the executive===\n{{Main|Ineligibility Clause}}\n{{See also|Saxbe fix}}\n{{quote|No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.}}\nSenators and Representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch. This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using [[patronage]] to buy votes in Congress.<ref name=\"Calabresi\" /> It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nFurthermore, Senators and Representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher-paying political positions; rather, they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected. If Congress increases the salary of a particular officer, it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from Congress and take that position (known as the [[Saxbe fix]]). The effects of the clause were discussed in 1937, when Senator [[Hugo Black]] was appointed an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]] with some time left in his Senate term. Just prior to the appointment, Congress had increased the pension available to Justices retiring at the age of seventy. It was therefore suggested by some that the office's emolument had been increased during Black's Senatorial term, and that therefore Black could not take office as a Justice. The response, however, was that Black was fifty-one years old, and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later, long after his Senate term had expired.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 7}}Section 7: Bills==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Bills of revenue===\n{{main|Origination Clause|l1=Bills of Revenue}}\n{{quote|All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.}}\nThis establishes the method for making [[Act of Congress|Acts of Congress]] that involve taxation.

This practice was intended to ensure that the [[power of the purse]]  is possessed by the legislative body most responsive to the people, although the English practice was modified in America by allowing the Senate to amend these bills. The clause was part of the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] between small and large states; the large states were unhappy with the lopsided power of small states in the Senate, and so the clause theoretically offsets the unrepresentative nature of the Senate, and compensates the large states for allowing equal voting rights to Senators from small states.<ref>Jensen, Erik and Monaghan, Henry.

If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.}}\nThis clause is known as the [[Presentment Clause]]. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the [[veto]], although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"[[pocket veto]]\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"<ref>See Ross Wilson, A Third Way: The Presidential Non-Signing Statement, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1593862</ref>\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the ''[[Pocket Veto Case]]'' (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In ''[[Wright v. United States]]'' (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 7, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Presidential veto===\n{{quote|Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.}}\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996|Line Item Veto Act]], which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'', the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].\n\nSome Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. [[Grover Cleveland]], for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power. There have been 2,560 vetoes, including [[pocket veto]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/BushGW.htm |title=U.S. Senate: Reference Home &gt; Statistics &amp; Lists &gt; Vetoes by President George W.

Most notably, Clauses 1 (the General Welfare or Taxing and Spending clause), 3 (the Commerce clause), and 18 (The Necessary and Proper clause) have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress. These three clauses have been interpreted so broadly that the federal government of the United States exercises many powers that are not expressly delegated to it by the states under the Constitution. Some point to the various social programs of the American [[welfare state#United States|welfare state]] as a prime example, and not all agree with this broad interpretation. [[James Madison]], who wrote much of the Constitution, asserted that Congress could not exercise powers unless they were expressly granted in the Constitution.  While he was President of the United States, Madison [[veto]]ed the Federal Public Works Bill of 1817, calling it unconstitutional, since in his view the federal government did not have the authority to [[Internal improvements|build infrastructure]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Madison - Veto of federal public works bill of March 3, 1817|url=http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105014440/http://www.constitution.org/jm/18170303_veto.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 5, 2018|accessdate= November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |title=Excerpt from James Madison\u2019s Veto Message: March 3, 1817 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430011150/https://edsitement.neh.gov/sites/edsitement.neh.gov/files/worksheets/VetoMsg.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/presvetoes17891988.pdf Presidential Vetoes, 1789\u20131988, p. 34]</ref>\n\n===Clause 1: the General Welfare Clause===\nThis clause is also referred to as the Spending Clause and the Taxing and Spending Clause.<ref>{{cite web|title= |url=https://constitutionallawreporter.com/taxing-and-spending-clause/|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> It states that Congress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the [[political question]] to Congress. In ''[[United States v. Butler]]'' (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the [[Taxing and Spending Clause]]; for instance, the [[social security]] program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\n===Clause 2: Borrowing Power===\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding ''[[Knox v. Lee]],'' the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges on its commitment.<ref>See ''e.g.'' Perry v. United States, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3388791031923623137 294 U.S. 330 (1935).]</ref>\n\n===Clause 3: Commerce Clause===\n[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] established a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause.]]\n{{Main|Commerce Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;}}\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the ''[[commerce clause]]'' for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: [[Thomas Gibbons (politician)|Thomas Gibbons]] had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the [[Hudson River]], while the other, [[Aaron Ogden]], had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitude dominated the Court. In ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Company]]'' (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled [[New Deal]] programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]],'' (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company]]'', that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in \"[[unfair labor practice]]s\" such as firing workers for joining [[labor union|unions]]. In sustaining this act, the Court signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', the Court ruled that production quotas under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]] were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of [[handgun]]s, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by ''Wickard v. Filburn''. In ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] even where states approve its use for [[medical cannabis|medicinal purposes]]. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\n===Clause 18: Implied Powers of Congress===\n====Other powers of Congress====\n[[File:USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA-31) underway in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2 November 1964.jpg|thumb| alt=Aircraft carrier at sea.|Congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']].]]\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to [[naturalization]] and [[bankruptcy]]. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish [[Postal Clause|post offices and post roads]] (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting [[United States copyright law|copyrights]] and [[United States patent law|patents]] of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the [[Copyright Clause]], is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<ref>[[Michael Novak|Novak, Michael]] (1996). The fire of invention, the fuel of interest: On intellectual property. Washington D.C.: The American Enterprise Institute Press.</ref> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the [[War Powers Clause]], only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against [[Pancho Villa]] constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant [[letter of marque|letters of marque]] and [[reprisal]]. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the [[Feres v. United States|Feres Doctrine]].\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected [[Mayor of Washington, D.C.|mayor]] and [[Council of the District of Columbia|council]] of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\n====Necessary and Proper====\n{{Main|Necessary and Proper Clause}}\n{{quote|The Congress shall have Power [...] To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.}}\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in ''Wickard v. Filburn''; however, [[Thomas Jefferson]], in the [[Kentucky Resolutions]], supported by [[James Madison]], maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for [[treason]], [[counterfeiting]], [[piracy]] and [[felony]] on the [[high seas]], and offenses against the [[law of nations]].\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), which involved the establishment of a [[Second Bank of the United States|national bank]]. [[Alexander Hamilton]], in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing ''all'' of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as [[implied powers]]) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 9}}Section 9: Limits on Congress==\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\n{{quote|The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of ''[[wiktionary:habeas corpus|Habeas Corpus]]'' shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\n\nNo [[Bill of attainder]] or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\n\nNo [[Poll tax|Capitation]], or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\n\nNo Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.\n\nNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, [[wiktionary:emolument#Noun|Emolument]], Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.}}\n\n===Clause 1: Slave trade===\n[[File:Africa and the American Flag.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|U.S. brig ''[[USS Perry (1843)|Perry]]'' confronting the slave ship ''Martha'' off [[Ambriz]] on June 6, 1850]]\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the [[slave trade|importation of slaves]] into the United States prior to 1808.  Congress could however, levy a ''[[per capita]]'' duty of up to ten [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollars]] for each slave imported into the country.  This clause was further [[entrenched clause#United States|entrenched]] into the Constitution by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]], where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.  On March 2, 1807, Congress approved legislation [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibiting the importation of slaves]] into the United States, which went into effect January 1, 1808, the first day of the prohibition permitted by the Constitution.\n\n===Clauses 2 and 3: Civil and legal protections===\nA writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'' (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of ''habeas corpus'' in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA [[bill of attainder]] is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An ''[[ex post facto]]'' law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The ''ex post facto'' clause does not apply to civil matters.<ref>[[Calder v. Bull]], 3 U.S. 386, 399-400 (1798).</ref>\n\n===Clauses 4-7: Apportionment of direct taxes===\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from [[#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Section Two, Clause 3]] that [[direct taxes]] must be apportioned by state populations.  This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]].  In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] exempted all [[income taxes]] from this clause. This overcame the ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]'' that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to dividends and capital gains. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]]s authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\n===Clause 8: Titles of nobility===\n{{main|Title of Nobility Clause}}\nThe [[Title of Nobility Clause]] prohibits Congress from granting any [[nobility|title of nobility]]. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state.  Emoluments were a profound concern of [[Founding Fathers of the United States|the Founders]].<ref name=impeachable-offenses>{{cite magazine|last1=Feldman|first1=Noah|authorlink1=Noah Feldman|last2=Weisberg|first2=Jacob|authorlink2=Jacob Weisberg|title=What Are Impeachable Offenses?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/donald-trump-impeachable-offenses|magazine=The New York Review of Books|date=September 28, 2017|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\n=={{anchor|Section 10}}Section 10: Limits on the States==\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 1}}Clause 1: Contracts Clause===\n{{further|Contract Clause|Bills of Credit}}\n{{quote|No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.}}\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue [[bills of credit]] (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/110/421/case.html ''Juilliard v. Greenman''], 110 U.S. 421, 446 (1884).</ref>) from \"making a tender\" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender%5B5%5D Definition of '''tender''' as noun, in Merriam-Webster]. Retrieved January 23, 2011.</ref>) of any type or form of [[money]] to meet any financial obligation,<ref>''\"Any\"'' financial obligation would ''de facto'' include financial obligations owed either ''by'' or ''to'' the state; see [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/any?show=0&t=1295805841 definition of ''\"any\"'' as noun (5), in Merriam-Webster]</ref> unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in ''Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank''<ref>262 U.S. 649, 659 (1923). See also ''[[Gwin v. Breedlove]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 29, 38 (1844); and ''[[Griffin v. Thompson]],'' 43 U.S. (2 How.) 244 (1844).</ref>). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In ''[[The Federalist Papers|Federalist no. 44]]'', Madison explains that \"it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded\".<ref>[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_1s5.html Madison, James ''Federalist Papers No. 44'']</ref> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact ''ex post facto'' laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Contract Clause]] was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when ''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' was decided. The case involved the [[Yazoo land scandal]], in which the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature<!--which was basically all of them-->. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties\". Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of ''[[Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' involved [[Dartmouth College]], which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, [[New Hampshire]] passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in ''[[Sturges v. Crowninshield]]''. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In ''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws ''could'' apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive [[Bankruptcy in the United States|federal bankruptcy law]] in 1898.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 2}}Clause 2: Import-Export Clause===\n{{main|Import-Export Clause}}\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's{{sic}}<!-- Please do not remove the apostrophe in \"it's\". That is how it is spelled in the original document. --> inspection Laws: and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul{{sic}} of the Congress.}}\nStill more powers are prohibited of the states. States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\n\n==={{anchor|Section 10, Clause 3}}Clause 3: Compact Clause===\n{{quote|No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.}}\n\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace. They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states, nor engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. (Article I, Section 8, enumerated powers of Congress.) The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], whose members are also members of the [[Militia (United States)|militia of the United States]] as defined by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|311}}, fulfill this function, as do persons serving in [[State Defense Forces|State Militias]] with federal oversight under {{UnitedStatesCode|32|109}}.\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to [[the Crown]] for approval. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an [[interstate compact]].  In ''[[Virginia v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|148|503|1893}}, the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\".<ref>{{cite book |title=American Constitutional Law|last=Tribe |first=Laurence | authorlink=Laurence Tribe |year=2000 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=1-56662-714-1 |pages=649\u201351}}</ref> The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet [[Coming into force|effective]] [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]] entered into by fifteen states plus the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brody|first1=Michael|title=Circumventing the Electoral College: Why the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact Survives Constitutional Scrutiny Under the Compact Clause|journal=Legislation and Policy Brief|date=February 17, 2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40ff|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=lpb|accessdate=September 11, 2014|publisher=Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ American University Washington College of Law}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Peter H.

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]].

For the construction of Changi Airport station, different methods of deep excavations using various ground support systems were adopted.

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]].
