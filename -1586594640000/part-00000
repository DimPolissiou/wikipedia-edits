Their settlements, most prominently the assumed capital city of [[Petra|Raqmu]] (present-day Petra, [[Jordan]]),<ref name=livius/> gave the name of '''''Nabatene''''' to the borderland between Arabia and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], from the [[Euphrates]] to the [[Red Sea]]. Their loosely controlled trading network had no securely defined boundaries in the surrounding desert; it focused primarily on strings of oases under their control, where agriculture was intensively practiced in limited areas, and on the routes that linked them together. They maintained territorial independence from their emergence in the 4th century BC until Nabataea was conquered by [[Trajan]] in 106 AD, annexing it to the [[Roman Empire]]. Nabataeans' individual culture, easily identified by their characteristic finely potted painted ceramics, was adopted into the larger [[Greco-Roman culture]]. They were later converted to [[Christianity]] during the [[Byzantine Era]]. Jane Taylor, a writer, describes them as \"one of the most gifted peoples of the ancient world\".<ref name=\"lost kingdom\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcAoBq4_EnEC|title=Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans |author=Taylor, Jane |pp=centerfold, 14 |year=2001 |publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]] |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-86064-508-2|quote =\"The Nabataean Arabs, one of the most gifted peoples of the ancient world, are today known only for their hauntingly beautiful rock-carved capital \u2014 Petra.\"}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical |width=\n |image1=Petra Jordan BW 22.JPG |caption1=[[Al-Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]]\n |image2=The Monastery, Petra, Jordan8.jpg |caption2=[[Ad Deir]] in Petra\n |image3=Avdat-v.jpg |caption3=[[Avdat]], [[Israel]]\n}}\nThe Nabataeans were one among several [[nomadic]] [[tribe]]s who roamed the [[Arabian Desert]], moving with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. These nomads became familiar with their area as seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall diminished.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/> Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, modern scholars reject theories about their having [[Aramean]] roots. Instead, historical, religious and linguistic evidence identifies them as a northern [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribe]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=A0BdsFRX55cC|title= Arabs in the Shadow of Israel: The Unfolding of God's Prophetic Plan for Ishmael's Line|isbn= 978-0-8254-9363-8|publisher= Kregel Academic|first= Tony|last= Maalouf|year= 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe precise origin of this specific tribe of Arab nomads remains uncertain. One hypothesis locates their original homeland in today's [[Yemen]], in the south-west of the Arabian peninsula; however, their deities, language and script share nothing with those of southern Arabia. Another hypothesis argues that they came from the eastern coast of the Peninsula.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/> The suggestion that they came from [[Hejaz]] area is considered by Michele Murray<ref>''Religion and the Nomadic Lifestyle: The Nabateans'' p. 217.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2019}} to be more convincing, as they share many deities with the ancient people there, and \"nbtw\", the root consonant of the tribe's name, is found in the early [[Semitic languages]] of Hejaz.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\n\nSimilarities between late [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean]] Arabic dialect and the ones found in [[Mesopotamia]] during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] period, and the fact that the Assyrians listed a group with the name of \"Nabatu\" as one of several rebellious Arab tribes in the region, suggests a connection between the two.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/> The Nabataeans might have originated from there and migrated west between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE into northwestern Arabia and much of what is now [[Jordan]].<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\n\nNabataeans have been falsely associated with other groups of people. A people called the \"Nabaiti\" who were defeated by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]] and described{{by whom|date=April 2018}} as living \"in a far off desert where there are no wild animals and not even the birds build their nests\", were associated by some{{by whom|date=April 2018}} with the Nabataeans due to the temptation to link their similar names and images. One claim by Jane Taylor alleges a misconception in their identification with the [[Nebaioth]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the descendants of [[Ishmael]], [[Abraham]]'s son.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\n\nHerodotus mentioned an Arabian king, most likely the Nabatean king, who was an ally of the Persians and gave them a safe passage to Egypt.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historiesofherod00herorich/historiesofherod00herorich_djvu.txt Herodotus, ARABIA, 1, 55 ]</ref> According to the same source, all people of West Asia were subjects to the Persians except the Arabians who never submitted to the Persian yoke. \n\nUnlike the rest of the Arabian tribes, the Nabataeans later emerged as vital players in the region{{which|date=April 2018}} during their times of prosperity. However, they later faded and were forgotten.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\nThe brief [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Israelites|Hebrews]] that began in 586 BCE opened a minor power vacuum in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (prior to the [[Judea|Judaeans']] return under the Persian King, [[Cyrus the Great]], who reigned 559\u2013530 BCE). As [[Edom]]ites moved into open Judaean grazing lands, Nabataean inscriptions began to appear in Edomite territory. The first definite appearance dates from 312/311 BCE, when they were attacked at [[Sela (Edom)|Sela]] or perhaps at [[Petra]] without success by [[Antigonus I]]'s officer Athenaeus in the course of the [[Third War of the Diadochi]]; at that time [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], a [[Seleucid]] officer, mentioned the Nabataeans in a battle report. About 50 BCE, the [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] cited Hieronymus in his report,{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} and added the following: \"Just as the Seleucids had tried to subdue them, so the Romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade.\"{{Citation needed |date= February 2010}}\n\nThe Nabataeans had already some trace of Aramaic culture when they first appear in history. They wrote a letter to Antigonus in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] letters, and Aramaic continued as the language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom and profited by the decay of the Seleucids to extend its borders northward over the more fertile country east of the [[Jordan river]]. They occupied [[Hauran]], and in about 85 BCE their king [[Aretas III]] became lord of [[Damascus]] and [[Coele-Syria]]. Proper names on their inscriptions suggest that they were ethnically Arabs who had come under Aramaic influence. Starcky identifies the Nabatu of southern Arabia (Pre-Khalan migration) as their ancestors.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} However, different groups amongst the Nabataeans wrote their names in slightly different ways; consequently archaeologists are reluctant to say that they all belonged to the same tribe, or that any one group represents the original Nabataeans.{{citation needed|date= October 2016}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Incense Route}}\n[[File:NabateensRoutes.png|thumb|Nabataean trade routes]]\nMany examples of graffiti and inscriptions\u2014largely of names and greetings\u2014document the area of Nabataean culture, which extended as far north as the north end of the [[Dead Sea]], and testify to widespread literacy; but except for a few letters<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/search?locale=en_US|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls - Browse Manuscripts|website=The Dead Sea Scrolls - Browse Manuscripts}}</ref> no Nabataean literature has survived, nor was any noted in antiquity.<ref>The carbonized [[Petra papyri]], mostly economic documents in Greek, date to the 6th century: Glen L.

Classical references to the Nabataeans begin with [[Diodorus Siculus]]; they suggest that the Nabataeans' trade routes and the origins of their goods were regarded as trade secrets, and disguised in tales that should have strained outsiders' credulity. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (book II) described them as a strong tribe of some 10,000 warriors, pre-eminent among the nomads of Arabia, eschewing agriculture, fixed houses, and the use of wine, but adding to pastoral pursuits a profitable trade with the seaports in [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]] and spices from [[Arabia Felix]] (today's Yemen), as well as a trade with [[Egypt]] in [[bitumen]] from the Dead Sea. Their arid country was their best safeguard, for the bottle-shaped cisterns for rain-water which they excavated in the rocky or clay-rich soil were carefully concealed from invaders.<ref>J. W.

The greatest testimony to the status of the god after the fall of the Nabataean Kingdom was during the 1000th anniversary of the founding of Rome where Dushara was celebrated in [[Bosra|Bostra]] by striking coins in his name, Actia Dusaria (linking the god with [[Augustus]] victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]).

Their most common monuments to the gods, commonly known as \"god blocks\", involved cutting away the whole top of a hill or cliff face so as to leave only a block behind. However, the Nabataeans became so influenced by other cultures such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and Rome that their gods eventually became anthropomorphic and were represented with human features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/bar-issues/may-june-2016/#toc|title=Biblical Archaeology Review, May/June 2016, page 20}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Qasr al Farid.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Qasr al-Farid]], the largest tomb at Mada'in Saleh]]\nThe Nabataeans spoke a form of Arabic.

One was to contour an area of land into a shallow funnel and to plant a single fruit tree in the middle. Before the '[[rainy season]]', which could easily consist of only one or two rain events, the area around the tree was broken up. When the rain came, all the water that collected in the funnel would flow down toward the fruit tree and sink into the ground. The ground, which was largely [[loess]], would seal up when it got wet and retain the water.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, a research team headed by [[Michael Evenari]] set up a research station near Avdat (Evenari, Shenan and Tadmor 1971). He focused on the relevance of runoff rainwater management in explaining the mechanism of the ancient agricultural features, such as terraced wadis, channels for collecting runoff rainwater, and the enigmatic phenomenon of \"Tuleilat el-Anab\". Evenari showed that the runoff rainwater collection systems concentrate water from an area that is five times larger than the area in which the water actually drains.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAnother study was conducted by Y. Kedar{{who|date=November 2014}} in 1957, which also focused on the mechanism{{vague|date=November 2014}} of the agriculture systems, but he studied soil management, and claimed that the ancient agriculture systems were intended to increase the accumulation of loess in [[wadi]]s and create an infrastructure for agricultural activity.

In 62 BCE, [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] accepted a bribe of 300 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] to lift the siege of Petra, partly because of the difficult terrain and the fact that he had run out of supplies.

After this defeat, the Nabataean forces amassed near [[Canatha]] in Syria, but were attacked and routed. Cleopatra's general, [[Athenion (general)|Athenion]], sent Canathans to the aid of the Nabataeans, and this force crushed Herod's army, which then fled to Ormiza.

The Nabataeans under Elthemus refused to give battle, so Herod forced the issue when he attacked their [[Palisade|camp]]. A confused mass of Nabataeans gave battle but were defeated. Once they had retreated to their defences, Herod laid siege to the camp and over time some of the defenders surrendered. The remaining Nabataean forces offered 500 talents for peace, but this was rejected.

Their settlements, most prominently the assumed capital city of [[Petra|Raqmu]] (present-day Petra, [[Jordan]]),<ref name=livius/> gave the name of '''''Nabatene''''' to the borderland between Arabia and [[Syria (region)|Syria]], from the [[Euphrates]] to the [[Red Sea]]. Their loosely controlled trading network had no securely defined boundaries in the surrounding desert; it focused primarily on strings of oases under their control, where agriculture was intensively practiced in limited areas, and on the routes that linked them together. They maintained territorial independence from their emergence in the 4th century BC until Nabataea was conquered by [[Trajan]] in 106 AD, annexing it to the [[Roman Empire]]. Nabataeans' individual culture, easily identified by their characteristic finely potted painted ceramics, was adopted into the larger [[Greco-Roman culture]]. They were later converted to [[Christianity]] during the [[Byzantine Era]].

These nomads became familiar with their area as seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall diminished.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/> Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, modern scholars reject theories about their having [[Aramean]] roots. Instead, historical, religious and linguistic evidence identifies them as a northern [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribe]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=A0BdsFRX55cC|title= Arabs in the Shadow of Israel: The Unfolding of God's Prophetic Plan for Ishmael's Line|isbn= 978-0-8254-9363-8|publisher= Kregel Academic|first= Tony|last= Maalouf|year= 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe precise origin of this specific tribe of Arab nomads remains uncertain. One hypothesis locates their original homeland in today's [[Yemen]], in the south-west of the Arabian peninsula; however, their deities, language and script share nothing with those of southern Arabia. Another hypothesis argues that they came from the eastern coast of the Peninsula.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/> The suggestion that they came from [[Hejaz]] area is considered by Michele Murray<ref>''Religion and the Nomadic Lifestyle: The Nabateans'' p. 217.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2019}} to be more convincing, as they share many deities with the ancient people there, and \"nbtw\", the root consonant of the tribe's name, is found in the early [[Semitic languages]] of Hejaz.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\n\nSimilarities between late [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean]] Arabic dialect and the ones found in [[Mesopotamia]] during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] period, and the fact that the Assyrians listed a group with the name of \"Nabatu\" as one of several rebellious Arab tribes in the region, suggests a connection between the two.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/> The Nabataeans might have originated from there and migrated west between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE into northwestern Arabia and much of what is now [[Jordan]].<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\n\nNabataeans have been falsely associated with other groups of people. A people called the \"Nabaiti\" who were defeated by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]] and described{{by whom|date=April 2018}} as living \"in a far off desert where there are no wild animals and not even the birds build their nests\", were associated by some{{by whom|date=April 2018}} with the Nabataeans due to the temptation to link their similar names and images. One claim by Jane Taylor alleges a misconception in their identification with the [[Nebaioth]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the descendants of [[Ishmael]], [[Abraham]]'s son.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\n\nHerodotus mentioned an Arabian king, most likely the Nabatean king, who was an ally of the Persians and gave them a safe passage to Egypt.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historiesofherod00herorich/historiesofherod00herorich_djvu.txt Herodotus, ARABIA, 1, 55 ]</ref> Also according to the same source, all people of West Asia were subjects to the Persians except the Arabians who never submitted to the Persian yoke. \n\nUnlike the rest of the Arabian tribes, the Nabataeans later emerged as vital players in the region{{which|date=April 2018}} during their times of prosperity. However, they later faded and were forgotten.<ref name=\"lost kingdom\"/>\nThe brief [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Israelites|Hebrews]] that began in 586 BCE opened a minor power vacuum in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (prior to the [[Judea|Judaeans']] return under the Persian King, [[Cyrus the Great]], who reigned 559\u2013530 BCE). As [[Edom]]ites moved into open Judaean grazing lands, Nabataean inscriptions began to appear in Edomite territory. The first definite appearance dates from 312/311 BCE, when they were attacked at [[Sela (Edom)|Sela]] or perhaps at [[Petra]] without success by [[Antigonus I]]'s officer Athenaeus in the course of the [[Third War of the Diadochi]]; at that time [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], a [[Seleucid]] officer, mentioned the Nabataeans in a battle report. About 50 BCE, the [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] cited Hieronymus in his report,{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} and added the following: \"Just as the Seleucids had tried to subdue them, so the Romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade.\"{{Citation needed |date= February 2010}}\n\nThe Nabataeans had already some trace of Aramaic culture when they first appear in history. They wrote a letter to Antigonus in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] letters, and Aramaic continued as the language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom and profited by the decay of the Seleucids to extend its borders northward over the more fertile country east of the [[Jordan river]]. They occupied [[Hauran]], and in about 85 BCE their king [[Aretas III]] became lord of [[Damascus]] and [[Coele-Syria]]. Proper names on their inscriptions suggest that they were ethnically Arabs who had come under Aramaic influence. Starcky identifies the Nabatu of southern Arabia (Pre-Khalan migration) as their ancestors.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} However, different groups amongst the Nabataeans wrote their names in slightly different ways; consequently archaeologists are reluctant to say that they all belonged to the same tribe, or that any one group represents the original Nabataeans.{{citation needed|date= October 2016}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Incense Route}}\n[[File:NabateensRoutes.png|thumb|Nabataean trade routes]]\nMany examples of graffiti and inscriptions\u2014largely of names and greetings\u2014document the area of Nabataean culture, which extended as far north as the north end of the [[Dead Sea]], and testify to widespread literacy; but except for a few letters<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/search?locale=en_US|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls - Browse Manuscripts|website=The Dead Sea Scrolls - Browse Manuscripts}}</ref> no Nabataean literature has survived, nor was any noted in antiquity.<ref>The carbonized [[Petra papyri]], mostly economic documents in Greek, date to the 6th century: Glen L.

Classical references to the Nabataeans begin with [[Diodorus Siculus]]; they suggest that the Nabataeans' trade routes and the origins of their goods were regarded as trade secrets, and disguised in tales that should have strained outsiders' credulity. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (book II) described them as a strong tribe of some 10,000 warriors, pre-eminent among the nomads of Arabia, eschewing agriculture, fixed houses, and the use of wine, but adding to pastoral pursuits a profitable trade with the seaports in [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]] and spices from [[Arabia Felix]] (today's Yemen), as well as a trade with [[Egypt]] in [[bitumen]] from the Dead Sea. Their arid country was their best safeguard, for the bottle-shaped cisterns for rain-water which they excavated in the rocky or clay-rich soil were carefully concealed from invaders.<ref>J. W.

She was probably a solar deity.<ref name=\"S\u00e1nchez2015\"/>\n\nAlthough when the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] annexed the Nabataean Kingdom, Dushara still had an important role despite losing his former royal privilege. The greatest testimony to the status of the god after the fall of the Nabataean Kingdom was during the 1000th anniversary of the founding of Rome where Dushara was celebrated in [[Bosra|Bostra]] by striking coins in his name, Actia Dusaria (linking the god with [[Augustus]] victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]]).

Their most common monuments to the gods, commonly known as \"god blocks\", involved cutting away the whole top of a hill or cliff face so as to leave only a block behind. However, the Nabataeans became so influenced by other cultures such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and Rome that their gods eventually became anthropomorphic and were represented with human features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/bar-issues/may-june-2016/#toc|title=Biblical Archaeology Review, May/June 2016, page 20}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Qasr al Farid.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Qasr al-Farid]], the largest tomb at Mada'in Saleh]]\nThe Nabataeans spoke a form of Arabic.

One was to contour an area of land into a shallow funnel and to plant a single fruit tree in the middle. Before the '[[rainy season]]', which could easily consist of only one or two rain events, the area around the tree was broken up. When the rain came, all the water that collected in the funnel would flow down toward the fruit tree and sink into the ground. The ground, which was largely [[loess]], would seal up when it got wet and retain the water.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, a research team headed by [[Michael Evenari]] set up a research station near Avdat (Evenari, Shenan and Tadmor 1971). He focused on the relevance of runoff rainwater management in explaining the mechanism of the ancient agricultural features, such as terraced wadis, channels for collecting runoff rainwater, and the enigmatic phenomenon of \"Tuleilat el-Anab\". Evenari showed that the runoff rainwater collection systems concentrate water from an area that is five times larger than the area in which the water actually drains.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAnother study was conducted by Y. Kedar{{who|date=November 2014}} in 1957, which also focused on the mechanism{{vague|date=November 2014}} of the agriculture systems, but he studied soil management, and claimed that the ancient agriculture systems were intended to increase the accumulation of loess in [[wadi]]s and create an infrastructure for agricultural activity.

According to historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], many Nabataeans were forcefully converted to Judaism by Hasmonean king [[Alexander Jannaeus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=A History of the Jews|year=1987|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-79091-4}}</ref> It was this king who, after putting down a local rebellion, invaded and occupied the Nabataean towns of [[Moab]] and [[Gilead]] and imposed a tribute of an unknown amount. [[Obodas I]] knew that Alexander would attack, so was able to ambush Alexander's forces near Gaulane destroying the Judean army (90 BC).<ref>{{cite book|last=Josephus|first=Flavius|authorlink=Josephus|title=The Jewish War |year=1981 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|page=40|volume= 1:87|isbn=978-0-14-044420-9|others=Trans.

In 62 BCE, [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] accepted a bribe of 300 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] to lift the siege of Petra, partly because of the difficult terrain and the fact that he had run out of supplies. [[Hyrcanus II]], who was a friend of Aretas, was despatched by Scaurus to the King to buy peace. In so obtaining peace, King Aretas retained all his possessions, including Damascus, and became a Roman vassal.<ref>Josephus 1:61, p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn 32 BCE, during King [[Malichus II]]'s reign, [[Herod the Great]], with the support of [[Cleopatra]], started a war against Nabataea. The war began with Herod plundering Nabataea with a large cavalry force, and occupying [[Dion, Jordan|Dium]]. After this defeat, the Nabataean forces amassed near [[Canatha]] in Syria, but were attacked and routed. Cleopatra's general, [[Athenion (general)|Athenion]], sent Canathans to the aid of the Nabataeans, and this force crushed Herod's army, which then fled to Ormiza. One year later, Herod's army overran Nabataea.<ref>Josephus 1:363\u2013377, pp. 75\u201377.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Nabatean Pillars Bosra.jpg|thumb|left|Colossal Nabataean columns stand in [[Bosra]], [[Syria]]]]\nAfter an earthquake in Judaea, the Nabateans rebelled and invaded Israel, but Herod at once crossed the Jordan river to Philadelphia (modern [[Amman]]) and both sides set up camp. The Nabataeans under Elthemus refused to give battle, so Herod forced the issue when he attacked their [[Palisade|camp]]. A confused mass of Nabataeans gave battle but were defeated. Once they had retreated to their defences, Herod laid siege to the camp and over time some of the defenders surrendered. The remaining Nabataean forces offered 500 talents for peace, but this was rejected. Lacking water, the Nabataeans were forced out of their camp for battle, but were defeated in this last battle.<ref>Josephus 1:377\u2013391, pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\n==Roman period==\nAn ally of the Roman Empire, the Nabataean kingdom flourished throughout the 1st century. Its power extended far into Arabia along the Red Sea to Yemen, and Petra was a cosmopolitan marketplace, though its commerce was diminished by the rise of the Eastern trade-route from [[Myos Hormos]] to [[Coptos]] on the [[Nile]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Under the ''[[Pax Romana]]'', the Nabataeans lost their warlike and nomadic habits and became a sober, acquisitive, orderly people, wholly intent on trade and agriculture. The kingdom was a bulwark between Rome and the wild hordes of the desert except in the time of Trajan, who reduced Petra and converted the Nabataean [[client state]] into the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]]. By the 3rd century, the Nabataeans had stopped writing in Aramaic and begun writing in [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] instead, and by the 5th century they had converted to Christianity.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rimon |first=Ofra |title=The Nabateans in the Negev |url=http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/archeology/ExhibitionC_eng.aspx?id=9 |publisher=[[Hecht Museum]] |access-date=7 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120110215/http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/archeology/ExhibitionC_eng.aspx?id=9 |archive-date=20 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The new Arab invaders, who soon pressed forward into their seats, found the remnants of the Nabataeans transformed into [[peasant]]s.

During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was under the control of [[Japanese pirates|pirates]], from whom emerged [[Kuki Yoshitaka]] (from Nakiri district) as a dominant ruler. After having dominated the local seacoasts, he established Toba as his capital and built a [[Japanese castle|castle]] there.  Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the castle became the center for [[Toba Domain]].\n\nIn the [[Edo period]], Toba flourished in trade and as a transshipment port between [[Osaka]] and [[Edo]]. The modern city of Toba was formed on November 1, 1954, by the merger of the town of Toba with five villages in [[Shima District, Mie|Shima District]].\n\n==Transportation==\n===Railway===\n*[[Central Japan Railway Company|JR Central]] -

The total area was {{convert|107.34|sqkm|sqmi}}.\n\n==Geography==\nToba is located on the northern half of Shima Peninsula in far eastern Mie Prefecture, facing [[Ise Bay]] of the Pacific Ocean. The area is famous for [[oyster]]s and for [[cultured pearl]]s. Much of the city is within the borders of the [[Ise-Shima National Park]].\n\nToba administers numerous islands in the [[Ise Bay]], the most important of which are:\n*[[Kamishima]]\n*[[Kozukumi Island]]\n*[[\u014czukumi-jima]]\n*[[Sugashima]]\n*[[T\u014dshijima]]\n*[[Sakatejima]]\n*[[Mitsujima]]\n\n===Neighboring municipalities===\n*Mie Prefecture\n**[[Ise, Mie|Ise]]\n**[[Shima, Mie|Shima]]\n\n==History==\nThe area of modern Toba has been continuously inhabited since before the [[J\u014dmon period]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was under the control of [[Japanese pirates|pirates]], from whom emerged [[Kuki Yoshitaka]] (from Nakiri district) as a dominant ruler. After having dominated the local seacoasts, he established Toba as his capital and built a [[Japanese castle|castle]] there.  Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the castle became the center for [[Toba Domain]].\n\nIn the [[Edo period]], Toba flourished in trade and as a transshipment port between [[Osaka]] and [[Edo]]. The modern city of Toba was formed on November 1, 1954, by the merger of the town of Toba with five villages in [[Shima District, Mie|Shima District]].\n\n==Transportation==\n===Railway===\n*[[Central Japan Railway Company|JR Central]] - [[Sang\u016b Line]]\n** {{STN|Toba}}\n*[[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] - [[Toba Line]]\n** {{STN|Ikenoura}} - {{STN|Toba}}\n*[[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] - [[Shima Line]]\n** {{STN|Toba}} - {{STN|Nakanog\u014d}} - {{STN|Shima-Akasaki}} - {{STN|Funatsu|Toba}} - {{STN|Kamo|Mie}} - {{STN|Matsuo|Mie}} - {{STN|Shiraki}}\n\n===Highway===\n*[[Iseshima Skyline]]\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|42}}\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|167}}\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|259}}\n\n===Ferry===\n*[[Ise-wan Ferry]]\n\n==Economy==\n[[Commercial fishing]] and cultivated pearls, together with tourism, form the backbone of the local economy.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Toba National College of Maritime Technology]] is one of the five maritime technology colleges in Japan and offers merchant marine programs such as Deck officer, Marine Engineering and other advanced programs related to maritime education.<ref>[http://www.edumaritime.com/international/japan Marine Programs in Toba]</ref>\n*Toba has ten elementary schools, five middle schools and one high school.\n\n==Climate==\n<div style=\"width:75%\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = Toba \uff081981 - 2010\uff09\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 9.0\n|Feb high C = 9.5\n|Mar high C = 13.0\n|Apr high C = 18.6\n|May high C = 22.7\n|Jun high C = 25.9\n|Jul high C = 29.8\n|Aug high C = 31.0\n|Sep high C = 27.4\n|Oct high C = 21.9\n|Nov high C = 16.6\n|Dec high C = 11.7\n|Jan low C = 1.7\n|Feb low C = 1.8\n|Mar low C = 4.4\n|Apr low C = 9.3\n|May low C = 13.9\n|Jun low C = 18.2\n|Jul low C = 22.4\n|Aug low C = 23.5\n|Sep low C = 20.4\n|Oct low C = 14.6\n|Nov low C = 8.9\n|Dec low C = 3.9\n|Jan precipitation mm = 77.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 95.1\n|Mar precipitation mm = 182.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 203.0\n|May precipitation mm = 260.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 266.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 197.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 205.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 397.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 257.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 148.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 68.3\n|Jan sun = 159.8\n|Feb sun = 156.4\n|Mar sun = 172.5\n|Apr sun = 179.2\n|May sun = 176.4\n|Jun sun = 140.5\n|Jul sun = 174.2\n|Aug sun = 198.1\n|Sep sun = 143.5\n|Oct sun = 151.3\n|Nov sun = 153.9\n|Dec sun = 166.4\n|source = [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_amd_ym.php?prec_no=53&block_no=1230&year=&month=&day=&view=|title=\u6c17\u8c61\u5e81<nowiki>|</nowiki>\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u6c17\u8c61\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u691c\u7d22 |accessdate=2014-12-26}}</ref> \n}}\n</div>\n\n==Local attractions==\n*[[Mikimoto Pearl Island]]\n*[[Toba Aquarium]]\n*[[Toba Castle]]\n\n==Sister city relations==\n*{{flagicon|USA}} - [[Santa Barbara, California]], since 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/City%20of%20Toba|title=City of Toba|publisher=Sister Cities International }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|Japan}} - [[Sanda, Hy\u014dgo]], Friendship city since July 1, 1971\n\n==Notable people from Toba==\n*[[Mikimoto K\u014dkichi]] \u2013 Entrepreneur and businessman\n*[[Mitsuru Hattori]] \u2013 Manga artist\n*[[Tsunekazu Ishihara]] \u2013 President of [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{wikivoyage-inline|Toba}}\n* {{osmrelation-inline|4538731}}\n* {{official|http://www.city.toba.mie.jp}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* [http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/917/A+Day+Tripper's+Guide+to+Ise+and+Toba A Day Tripper's Guide to Ise and Toba] ''Japanzine'' by Zack Davisson\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mie}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Cities in Mie Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Godsfewew1232s", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba,_Mie"}

In addition, the tailplane could be mounted either on top of the fin (\"T-tail\") or below the fuselage. The tests ultimately confirmed that the original P.1/Lightning design was an effective configuration for high speed flight.\n\n==Design and development==\nA technical dispute arose between the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the [[English Electric]] Company (EEC) as to the optimum configuration for the company's proposed supersonic fighter. A single-seat, mid-winged research machine was built to investigate the low speed handling of the possible configurations. The same basic configuration of the P.1 was incorporated into a simpler testbed that had a fixed undercarriage.<ref name=\"Winchester 2004, p. 149\">Winchester 2004, p. 149.</ref> Since the SB5 was to test the low-speed flight characteristics, there was no requirement for the undercarriage to be retractable.\n\nThe contract was awarded to Short Brothers and Harland Ltd of Belfast on 2 August 1950. The machine was designed to allow three different wing sweep angles (50\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 69\u00b0). The sweep adjustment of the wings was made when the aircraft was on the ground. Two different tail plane positions (a) low on the rear fuselage and (b) on top of the fin, were also tested. \"The complete rear fuselage, just aft of the engine, was detachable and two alternative rear fuselages were available, one with the tailplane set on top of the fin and the other with the tailplane set below the fuselage. The tailplane angle was adjustable in flight, being electrically actuated.\" <ref name=\"Staplesp4\"/>\n\nThe wings were made \"of plywood, except for light alloy sheeting at the leading and trailing edges,\"<ref name=\"Staplesp4\"/> which restricted the maximimum speed to a modest 350 knots (403&nbsp;mph; 649&nbsp;km/h).\n\n\"Two 20 feet [6.1 m] circumference brake parachutes and one 20 feet [6.1 m] anti-spin parachute ... housed in the rear fuselage above the jet pipe.\"<ref name=\"Staplesp4\"/>\n\nThe flight test report of the SB5 with 60 degrees of sweep and the tailplane in the lower position summarised the design criteria:\n\n\"At the time of the initial conception of the Short SB5 research aircraft (1949), it was recognised that the trend towards higher angles of sweepback was likely to continue, and this was emphasised by the existence of a design for an operational fighter aircraft, the English Electric P1 (Lightning), which was to have a sweepback of 60\u00b0. There was then no flight experience with wings of this amount of sweepback. The SB5 was designed to allow a gradual approach to this configuration, flying initially with 50\u00b0 sweepback before conversion to 60\u00b0 when it would resemble, aerodynamically, a seven-eighths scale model of the Lightning. To increase its usefulness as a research vehicle, the aircraft was capable of further modification to operate with 69\u00b0 of wing sweepback.\"<ref name=\"Staplesp4\">K. J. Staples, Flight Tests on the Short SB5 with 60 \u00b0and Low Tailplane Part I- Forces and Moments. p4</ref>\n\n==Operational testing==\n[[File:Short SB.5 WG768 8005M 28 ETPS FINN 200969 edited-1.jpg|thumb|right|The Short SB.5 wearing the '28' code of the Empire Test Pilots School, on display at RAF Finningley, in 1969]]\n\nTesting was conducted with increasing degrees of sweep and with the tailplane in both of its two possible positions:\n# The first flight, with the sweep set to 50\u00b0, was made from [[Boscombe Down]] by the Chief Test Pilot of Shorts, [[Tom Brooke-Smith]] on 2 December 1952. In 1953, he gave an impressive display of the SB5's man\u0153vrability and speed at the [[Society of British Aircraft Constructors]] Air Display at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]].\n# In July [[1953 in aviation|1953]], the first test flights were carried out with the wing-sweep set to the intermediate angle of 60\u00b0 and with the \"T-tail.\" Testing with the lower tailplane position commenced in January 1954, so that flight-test feedback could be made available prior to the first flight of the P.1. It was eventually determined that the \"T-tail\" configuration was unsatisfactory. Testing in the 60\u00b0 sweep configuration was completed in April 1958.\n# Before evaluating the final wing sweep configuration of 69\u00b0, a [[Martin-Baker]] ejection seat was fitted for the first time and the [[Rolls-Royce Derwent]] engine was changed for a [[Bristol Orpheus]] of greater thrust.<ref name=\"Winchester 2004, p. 149\"/> The first flight, with the final sweep setting of 69\u00b0 was made by Denis Tayler on 18 October 1960 at [[RAE Bedford]]; this was, at the time, the greatest degree of wing-sweep in the world.<ref name=cosford/>\n\nThe experience gained with the SB5 validated the wing-sweep and low tailplane configuration adopted for the P.1, which was to become the English Electric Lightning.<ref>Winchester 2004, p. 148.</ref>\nOver eleven months, the tests with 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 sweep were concluded with the high tail configuration. In January 1954, the low tail rear fuselage was fitted and tests continued for a further two years and proved that the EEC configuration was correct.\n\nAfter completion of its test programme, the SB5 eventually joined the fleet of the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]] (ETPS) at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] in 1967, as is evidenced by the ETPS 25th Anniversary brochure in 1968. The Empire Test Pilots School flew the machine to give students experience in flight-testing \"slender\" aircraft.<ref name=cosford>RAF Museum: [http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/collections/aircraft/short-brothers-sb5-wg768.cfm Short Brothers SB5 WG768] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317143241/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/collections/aircraft/short-brothers-sb5-wg768.cfm |date=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe SB.5 is now on display in the [[RAF Museum]], Cosford in Shropshire (with both of its tails).<ref name=\"Winchester 2004, p. 149\"/>\n\n== Operators ==\n;{{UK}}\n* [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]\n\n==Specifications (Short SB.5- 1952 configuration (high tail))==\n[[File:Short SB5.png|thumb|right|300px|Orthographic projection of the SB.5, with 60\u00b0 sweep.

In addition, the tailplane could be mounted either on top of the fin (\"T-tail\") or below the fuselage. The tests ultimately confirmed that the original P.1/Lightning design was an effective configuration for high speed flight.\n\n==Design and development==\nA technical dispute arose between the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the [[English Electric]] Company (EEC) as to the optimum configuration for the company's proposed supersonic fighter. A single-seat, mid-winged research machine was built to investigate the low speed handling of the possible configurations. The same basic configuration of the P.1 was incorporated into a simpler testbed that had a fixed undercarriage.<ref name=\"Winchester 2004, p. 149\">Winchester 2004, p. 149.</ref> Since the SB5 was to test the low-speed flight characteristics, there was no requirement for the undercarriage to be retractable.\n\nThe contract was awarded to Short Brothers and Harland Ltd of Belfast on 2 August 1950. The machine was designed to allow three different wing sweep angles (50\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 69\u00b0). The sweep adjustment of the wings was made when the aircraft was on the ground. Two different tail plane positions (a) low on the rear fuselage and (b) on top of the fin, were also tested. \"The complete rear fuselage, just aft of the engine, was detachable and two alternative rear fuselages were available, one with the tailplane set on top of the fin and the other with the tailplane set below the fuselage. The tailplane angle was adjustable in flight, being electrically actuated.\" <ref name=\"Staplesp4\"/>\n\nThe wings were made \"of plywood, except for light alloy sheeting at the leading and trailing edges,\"<ref name=\"Staplesp4\"/> which restricted the maximimum speed to a modest 350 knots (403&nbsp;mph; 649&nbsp;km/h).\n\n\"Two 20 feet [6.1 m] circumference brake parachutes and one 20 feet [6.1 m] anti-spin parachute ... housed in the rear fuselage above the jet pipe.\"<ref name=\"Staplesp4\"/>\n\nThe flight test report of the SB5 with 60 degrees of sweep and the tailplane in the lower position summarised the design criteria:\n\n\"At the time of the initial conception of the Short SB5 research aircraft (1949), it was recognised that the trend towards higher angles of sweepback was likely to continue, and this was emphasised by the existence of a design for an operational fighter aircraft, the English Electric P1 (Lightning), which was to have a sweepback of 60\u00b0. There was then no flight experience with wings of this amount of sweepback. The SB5 was designed to allow a gradual approach to this configuration, flying initially with 50\u00b0 sweepback before conversion to 60\u00b0 when it would resemble, aerodynamically, a seven-eighths scale model of the Lightning. To increase its usefulness as a research vehicle, the aircraft was capable of further modification to operate with 69\u00b0 of wing sweepback.\"<ref name=\"Staplesp4\">K. J. Staples, Flight Tests on the Short SB5 with 60 \u00b0and Low Tailplane Part I- Forces and Moments. p4</ref>\n\n==Operational testing==\n[[File:Short SB.5 WG768 8005M 28 ETPS FINN 200969 edited-1.jpg|thumb|right|The Short SB.5 wearing the '28' code of the Empire Test Pilots School, on display at RAF Finningley, in 1969]]\n\nTesting was conducted with increasing degrees of sweep and with the tailplane in both of its two possible positions: \n#The first flight, with the sweep set to 50\u00b0, was made from [[Boscombe Down]] by the Chief Test Pilot of Shorts, [[Tom Brooke-Smith]] on 2 December 1952. In 1953, he gave an impressive display of the SB5's man\u0153vrability and speed at the [[Society of British Aircraft Constructors]] Air Display at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]].\n#In July [[1953 in aviation|1953]], the first test flights were carried out with the wing-sweep set to the intermediate angle of 60\u00b0 and with the \"T-tail.\" Testing with the lower tailplane position commenced in January 1954, so that flight-test feedback could be made available prior to the first flight of the P.1. It was eventually determined that the \"T-tail\" configuration was unsatisfactory. Testing in the 60\u00b0 sweep configuration was completed in April 1958.\n#Before evaluating the final wing sweep configuration of 69\u00b0, a [[Martin-Baker]] ejection seat was fitted for the first time and the [[Rolls-Royce Derwent]] engine was changed for a [[Bristol Orpheus]] of greater thrust.<ref name=\"Winchester 2004, p. 149\"/> The first flight, with the final sweep setting of 69\u00b0 was made by Denis Tayler on 18 October 1960 at [[RAE Bedford]]; this was, at the time, the greatest degree of wing-sweep in the world.<ref name=cosford/>\n\nThe experience gained with the SB5 validated the wing-sweep and low tailplane configuration adopted for the P.1, which was to become the English Electric Lightning.<ref>Winchester 2004, p. 148.</ref>\nOver eleven months, the tests with 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 sweep were concluded with the high tail configuration. In January 1954, the low tail rear fuselage was fitted and tests continued for a further two years and proved that the EEC configuration was correct.\n\nAfter completion of its test programme, the SB5 eventually joined the fleet of the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]] (ETPS) at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] in 1967, as is evidenced by the ETPS 25th Anniversary brochure in 1968. The Empire Test Pilots School flew the machine to give students experience in flight-testing \"slender\" aircraft.<ref name=cosford>RAF Museum: [http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/collections/aircraft/short-brothers-sb5-wg768.cfm Short Brothers SB5 WG768] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317143241/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/cosford/collections/aircraft/short-brothers-sb5-wg768.cfm |date=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe SB.5 is now on display in the [[RAF Museum]], Cosford in Shropshire (with both of its tails).<ref name=\"Winchester 2004, p. 149\"/>\n\n== Operators ==\n;{{UK}}\n*[[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]\n\n== Specifications (Short SB.5- 1952 configuration (high tail))==\n[[File:Short SB5.png|thumb|right|300px|Orthographic projection of the SB.5, with 60\u00b0 sweep.

Breuci greatly resisted the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] but were conquered in 1st century BC and a lot of them were sold as [[slaves]] after their defeat. They started receiving Roman citizenship during [[Trajan|Trajan's]] rule.\n\nA number of Breuci migrated and settled in [[Dacia]], where a town called [[Bre\u021bcu|Bereck or Bre\u021bcu]], a river ([[Bre\u021bcu River]]) and a mountain [[Mun\u021bii Bre\u021bcului]] in today's [[Romania]] were named after them.<ref>Kiss Lajos: F\u00f6ldrajzi nevek etimol\u00f3giai sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1978 {{ISBN|963 05 1490 7}} 103. oldal '''Bereck'''-sz\u00f3cikk</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Brcko02.svg|thumb|200px|left|Br\u010dko District and Br\u010dko town]]\n\nThe city is located on the country's northern border, across the [[Sava|Sava River]] from [[Gunja (Croatia)|Gunja]] in Croatia.\n\nBr\u010dko is the seat of the ''[[Br\u010dko District]]'', an independent unit of local self-government created on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina following an arbitration process. The local administration was formerly supervised by an international supervisory regime headed by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|Principal Deputy High Representative]] who is also ''[[ex officio]]'' the Br\u010dko [[International Supervisor for Br\u010dko|International Supervisor]]. This international supervision was frozen since 23 May 2012.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pressb/default.asp?content_id=47197 |title=Press Conference Following the Meeting of the Steering Board of the Peace implementation Council |publisher=Ohr.int |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Expand section|1=information beyond 1996-97 period|small=no|date=July 2017}}\n}}\nBr\u010dko was a geographic point of contention in 1996 when the U.S.-led [[Implementation Force]] (IFOR) built Camp McGovern on the outskirts of the city. Camp McGovern under the overwatch of 3-5 CAV 1/BDE/1AR Division (US) commanded by LTC Anthony Cucculo was constructed from a war torn farming cooperative structure in the Zone of Separation (ZOS) for the purpose of establishing peacekeeping operations. The mission was to separate the forming warring factions. The ZOS was one kilometer wide of [[no man's land]], where special permission was required for Serbian or Bosnian forces to enter.  Various checkpoints and observation points (OP's) were established to control the separation.\n\nAlthough Br\u010dko was a focal point for tension in the late 1990s, considerable progress in multi-ethnic integration in Br\u010dko has since occurred including integration of secondary schooling. Reconstruction efforts and the Property Law Implementation Plan have improved the situation regarding property and return.\nToday, Br\u010dko has returned to a strategic transshipment point along the Sava River.  The population of Br\u010dko has not returned to its pre-war ethnic mix of Bosniacs, Serbs, and Croats. Br\u010dko sits at the east-west apex of Republika Srpska, the ethnic Serb portion of Bosnia & Herzegovina, and as such is critical to the RS for its economic future.\n\nBr\u010dko was one of the main points discussed in the [[Dayton Peace Accords]].  After several weeks of intensive negotiation, the issue of Br\u010dko was to be decided by international arbitration. Br\u010dko Arbitration ruled in May 1997 that Br\u010dko would be a special district managed by an ambassadorial representative from the international community. The first Ambassador to Br\u010dko was an American with support staff from the UK, Sweden, Denmark & France.\n\nThe first international organization to open office in Br\u010dko at that time was the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) headed by Randolph Hampton.\n\nFollowing [[Peace Implementation Council|PIC]] meeting on 23 May 2012, it was decided to suspend, not terminate, the mandate of Br\u010dko International Supervisor. Br\u010dko Arbitral Tribunal, together with the suspended Br\u010dko Supervision, will still continue to exist.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{{IPA-sh|br\u0329\u0302t\u0283ko\u02d0|pron}}) is a city and the administrative seat of [[Br\u010dko District]], in northern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It lies on the banks of [[Sava|Sava river]] across from [[Croatia]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 83,516 inhabitants, while the city of Br\u010dko has a population of 39,893 inhabitants.\n\nIt is the only existent entirely self-governing free city in Europe.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/14/brcko-bosnia-europe-only-free-city Welcome to Br\u010dko, Europe\u2019s only free city and a law unto itself].</ref>\n\n==Name==\nIts name is very likely linked to the ''[[Breuci]]'' (Greek \u0392\u03c1\u03b5\u1fe6\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9), a subtribe of [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria|Pannonian tribes]] of the [[Illyrians]] who migrated to the vicinity of today's Br\u010dko from the territories of the [[Yamnaya culture]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Breuci greatly resisted the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] but were conquered in 1st century BC and a lot of them were sold as [[slaves]] after their defeat. They started receiving Roman citizenship during [[Trajan|Trajan's]] rule.\n\nA number of Breuci migrated and settled in [[Dacia]], where a town called [[Bre\u021bcu|Bereck or Bre\u021bcu]], a river ([[Bre\u021bcu River]]) and a mountain [[Mun\u021bii Bre\u021bcului]] in today's [[Romania]] were named after them.<ref>Kiss Lajos: F\u00f6ldrajzi nevek etimol\u00f3giai sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1978 {{ISBN|963 05 1490 7}} 103. oldal '''Bereck'''-sz\u00f3cikk</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Brcko02.svg|thumb|200px|left|Br\u010dko District and Br\u010dko town]]\n\nThe city is located on the country's northern border, across the [[Sava|Sava River]] from [[Gunja (Croatia)|Gunja]] in Croatia.\n\nBr\u010dko is the seat of the ''[[Br\u010dko District]]'', an independent unit of local self-government created on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina following an arbitration process. The local administration was formerly supervised by an international supervisory regime headed by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|Principal Deputy High Representative]] who is also ''[[ex officio]]'' the Br\u010dko [[International Supervisor for Br\u010dko|International Supervisor]]. This international supervision was frozen since 23 May 2012.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/pressb/default.asp?content_id=47197 |title=Press Conference Following the Meeting of the Steering Board of the Peace implementation Council |publisher=Ohr.int |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Expand section|1=information beyond 1996-97 period|small=no|date=July 2017}}\n}}\nBr\u010dko was a geographic point of contention in 1996 when the U.S.-led [[Implementation Force]] (IFOR) built Camp McGovern on the outskirts of the city. Camp McGovern under the overwatch of 3-5 CAV 1/BDE/1AR Division (US) commanded by LTC Anthony Cucculo was constructed from a war torn farming cooperative structure in the Zone of Separation (ZOS) for the purpose of establishing peacekeeping operations. The mission was to separate the forming warring factions. The ZOS was one kilometer wide of [[no man's land]], where special permission was required for Serbian or Bosnian forces to enter.  Various checkpoints and observation points (OP's) were established to control the separation.\n\nAlthough Br\u010dko was a focal point for tension in the late 1990s, considerable progress in multi-ethnic integration in Br\u010dko has since occurred including integration of secondary schooling. Reconstruction efforts and the Property Law Implementation Plan have improved the situation regarding property and return.\nToday, Br\u010dko has returned to a strategic transshipment point along the Sava River.  The population of Br\u010dko has not returned to its pre-war ethnic mix of Bosniacs, Serbs, and Croats. Br\u010dko sits at the east-west apex of Republika Srpska, the ethnic Serb portion of Bosnia & Herzegovina, and as such is critical to the RS for its economic future.\n\nBr\u010dko was one of the main points discussed in the [[Dayton Peace Accords]].  After several weeks of intensive negotiation, the issue of Br\u010dko was to be decided by international arbitration. Br\u010dko Arbitration ruled in May 1997 that Br\u010dko would be a special district managed by an ambassadorial representative from the international community. The first Ambassador to Br\u010dko was an American with support staff from the UK, Sweden, Denmark & France.\n\nThe first international organization to open office in Br\u010dko at that time was the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) headed by Randolph Hampton.\n\nFollowing [[Peace Implementation Council|PIC]] meeting on 23 May 2012, it was decided to suspend, not terminate, the mandate of Br\u010dko International Supervisor. Br\u010dko Arbitral Tribunal, together with the suspended Br\u010dko Supervision, will still continue to exist.<ref name=\"picmeeting1\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

He earned 24 caps for the [[Northern Ireland national football team]], and was part of the team at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] when Northern Ireland reached the second round.\n\nAfter retirement from playing he became a manager, taking charge of [[Ards F.C.|Ards]], [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]], [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]], [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]] and [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]].\n\n==Biography==\nCassidy was born in [[Belfast]]. As a teenage striker he made an impressive impact on the Irish League. In 1969, after just a handful of senior appearances, he scored a hat-trick in the [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)]] Final, as Glentoran saw off Bangor 7\u20131. Early the following season, Cassidy having found the net four times in just six appearances, Newcastle United came calling with a \u00a315,000 bid. In October 1970 Cassidy found himself at an English First Division club after just fourteen senior outings for Glentoran.\n\nAlthough Cassidy's Football League debut didn't take long to arrive, he made his first appearance in a 2\u20130 defeat at Southampton on 7 November 1970, he had to wait three seasons to establish himself in the Newcastle first eleven. Prior to establishing himself, a rare senior outing was made in the 2-1 [[1973 Anglo-Italian Cup]] Final defeat of [[ACF Fiorentina]] [http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/angloit73.html]. By that time he was playing more normally as an attacking midfielder, and in his first season as a regular (1973/74) he helped Newcastle to a Texaco (British Isles) Cup Final victory over Burnley and an FA Cup Final appearance against Liverpool. The following season Cassidy was troubled by injury and made just nine League appearances, though he did play in the first leg of the [[Texaco Cup]] Final as Newcastle retained the trophy 3\u20131 on aggregate against Southampton. The following season Newcastle were back at Wembley for another final, losing out 2\u20131 in the League Cup to Manchester City.\n\nCassidy's Northern Ireland career had begun at the end of his first season in English football, coming on as a substitute for Eric McMordie in a 1-0 Home Nations defeat by England. The following season he made a further substitute appearance in a 1-1 European Championship Qualification match against the Soviet Union. As with his club career he had to bide his time before establishing himself in the international set-up. The real breakthrough with Northern Ireland came in 1973/74 as well, he marked his fourth cap, his first as a starter, with the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Scotland. It was to be his only international goal, and the last time he was on a victorious Northern Ireland team until 1979.\n\nThrough the mid-1970s, injuries permitting, Cassidy was a regular in the Northern Ireland team, until a falling out with [[Danny Blanchflower]] saw him banished from the set-up for two years. He did however return to favour for Blanchflower's last few matches, starting in a 5\u20131 defeat by England at Wembley, and coming off the bench during a 1\u20130 victory over the Republic of Ireland at Windsor Park.\n\nGroin, knee and ankle injuries had taken their toll on Cassidy's pace, and by the time Billy Bingham was appointed Northern Ireland manager in 1980, Cassidy was more at home as a defensive midfielder. Bingham used Cassidy in this role for each of his first nine games in charge, thus allowing the likes of McIlroy, Brotherston, Finney and O'Neill to make a suitable attacking impact. He played an important role in Northern Ireland's 1980 Home Nation Championship success, helping bring the old trophy back to Belfast for the first time in 66 years.\n\nCassidy's last season for Newcastle was 1979\u20131980, when the team topped the second division table at the start of 1980 and looked set to be promoted. Cassidy netted two notable goals at the end of the year, first scoring a 20-yard volley against Queens Park Rangers on 15 December to put the side 3-2 up (the game ended 4-2) and then registering an even better effort against Sunderland on New Year's Day to seal a 3\u20131 home win. Newcastle though dropped away and finished the season ninth.\n\nA \u00a330,000 move to Burnley, freshly relegated to Division Three, in the summer of 1980, did not initially harm Cassidy's international career, but over the following few seasons it became clear that Bingham was favouring players featuring regularly at a higher level. A few moments of glory in green remained however. In November 1981 he was called up to replace Martin O'Neill for the final World Cup Qualifier against Israel, a must win game to insure a place in Spain. Sure enough, Northern Ireland won 1\u20130, and Cassidy travelled with the squad to the Finals. In Spain he made a single appearance, coming off the bench for the injured Sammy McIlroy, and helping to steady ten-man Northern Ireland, during the historic 1\u20130 win over the hosts. Spain brought the curtain down on Cassidy's, somewhat up-and-down, international career in the most glorious of fashions.\n\nHaving helped Burnley to the Third Division title before travelling to Spain, Cassidy brought his Football League career to a close in 1983, before moving to play for [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL]] in Cyprus, where he won the Cup and the Super Cup. He later managed the club, leading them to the Cypriot League Championship, but left when he blew the whistle on high-level corruption in the game. He returned to the north-east of England to manage Gateshead, and was linked with the Newcastle job in 1992 prior to the arrival of Kevin Keegan. In 1994, he returned to the Oval as manager of a demoralised [[Glentoran]], and helped them to an early success in the Gold Cup. The rest of his time with the Glens proved difficult, with high-profile cup final failures and expensive transfer flops such as [[Liam Coyle]] being tempered only slightly by an Irish Cup Final win over Glenavon in 1996. Under pressure from the fans, Cassidy left Glentoran in December 1997.<ref>http://www.glentoran-fc.co.uk/managers.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1998 Cassidy was appointed manager of Ards, but was sacked in October 1999 when the board weren't satisfied with their prospects of promotion from the First Division \u2013 they were second at the time.\n\nLess than a month later Cassidy took charge of [[Sligo Rovers]]. In his first home game Sligo lost 5\u20133 to [[Shamrock Rovers]] and Cassidy got sent off [https://web.archive.org/web/20160306010905/http://www.shamrockrovers.ie/matchdays/84-sligo-3-5-rovers]. He couldn't save them from relegation from the Premier Division at the end of his first season. Sligo just missed out on promotion the following year when they lost the final match of the campaign 4\u20131 to [[Home Farm F.C.|Home Farm]], and Cassidy left the club that summer [http://www.rte.ie/sport/2001/0711/sligorovers.html].\n\nHe briefly scouted Irish League players for then Northern Ireland manager [[Sammy McIlroy]], before returning to management with Northern League Division One club, Workington. He guided the Reds to promotion to the Premier League in 2004, and runners-up spot the following season saw the club promoted to the Football Conference Northern Division.\n\nOn 16 December 2011 he joined Blyth Spartans as manager, but in October 2012 he was sacked by the club.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cassidy goes at Blyth|url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=88402|publisher=NonLeagueDaily.com|accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===As a player===\n* '''[[City Cup (Northern Ireland)]]'''\n** [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] - 1969\u201370\n* '''[[Anglo-Italian Cup]]'''\n** [[Newcastle United F.C.]] - [[1973 Anglo-Italian Cup]]\n* '''[[Texaco Cup]]: 2'''\n** [[Newcastle United F.C.]] - 1973\u201374, 1974\u201375\n* '''[[Football League Third Division]]'''\n** [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] - [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382]]\n* '''[[Cypriot Cup]]'''\n** [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL]] - 1983\u201384\n* '''[[LTV Super Cup]]'''\n** [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL]] - 1984\n\n===As a manager===\n* '''[[Cypriot First Division]]'''\n** [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL]] - [[1985\u201386 Cypriot First Division|1985\u201386]]\n* '''[[LTV Super Cup]]'''\n** [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL]] - 1986\n* '''[[Irish Cup]]'''\n** [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] 1995\u201396\n* '''[[Gold Cup (Northern Ireland)]]'''\n** [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] 1994\u201395\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110413080831/http://www.whitby-town.com/news10.php\n\nNewly appointed manager of Blyth Spartans\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120611044429/http://blythspartansafc.co.uk/new_php/?p=7718\n\n==External links==\n*[http://nifootball.blogspot.com/2006/08/tommy-cassidy.html Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats: Tommy Cassidy]\n\n{{Northern Ireland Squad 1982 World Cup}}\n\n{{APOEL FC managers}}\n{{Gateshead F.C. managers}}\n{{Glentoran F.C. managers}}\n{{Sligo Rovers F.C. managers}}\n{{Workington A.F.C. managers}}\n{{Whitby Town F.C. managers}}\n{{Blyth Spartans F.C. managers |state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cassidy, Tommy}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Belfast]]\n[[Category:Association football midfielders]]\n[[Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Northern Ireland international footballers]]\n[[Category:1982 FIFA World Cup players]]\n[[Category:Glentoran F.C. players]]\n[[Category:NIFL Premiership players]]\n[[Category:Newcastle United F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Burnley F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Cypriot First Division players]]\n[[Category:APOEL FC players]]\n[[Category:Expatriate football managers in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Expatriate football managers from Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Football managers from Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:APOEL FC managers]]\n[[Category:Gateshead F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Glentoran F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Sligo Rovers F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:League of Ireland managers]]\n[[Category:Blyth Spartans A.F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Whitby Town F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Newcastle Blue Star F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Workington A.F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Ards F.C. managers]]\n[[Category:Rangers F.C.

Archaeologists have found stone tools and [[shell midden]]s from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period and ceramic shards from the [[Jomon period|J\u014dmon]] and [[Kofun period]]s at numerous locations in the area. During the [[Heian period]], local warlord Muraoka Tamemichi established Kinugasa Castle in 1063. He became the ancestor of the [[Miura clan]], which subsequently dominated eastern [[Sagami Province]] for the next several hundred years. The [[Miura clan]] supported [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] in the foundation of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], but were later annihilated by [[H\u014dj\u014d Tokiyori]] in 1247. However, the family name was reassigned to a supporter of the [[H\u014dj\u014d clan]], and the Miura continued to rule [[Miura Peninsula]] through the [[Muromachi period]] until their defeat at Arai Castle in a 1518 attack by [[H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun]]. Following the defeat of the [[Later H\u014dj\u014d clan]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] transferred [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] to take control over the [[Kant\u014d region]], including Yokosuka in 1590.\n\nThe adventurer [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]] (inspiration for a character in the novel ''[[Sh\u014dgun (novel)|Sh\u014dgun]]''), the first Briton to set foot in Japan, arrived at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] aboard the Dutch trading vessel ''Liefde'' in 1600. In 1612, he was granted the title of [[samurai]] and a fief in Hemi within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka, due to his services to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. A monument to William Adams (called ''Miura Anjin'' in Japanese) is a local landmark in Yokosuka.\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]], Yokosuka ''[[tenry\u014d]]'' territory was controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], but administered through various ''[[hatamoto]]''. Due to its strategic location at the entrance to [[Edo Bay|Tokyo Bay]], the Shogunate established the post of Uraga ''Bugy\u014d'' in 1720, and all shipping into the bay was required to stop for inspection. As concerns over the increasing number of incursions by foreign vessels and attempts to end Japan's self-imposed [[sakoku|national seclusion policy]], the Shogunate established a number of [[coastal artillery]] batteries around Yokosuka, including an outpost at \u014ctsu in 1842. However, despite these efforts, in 1853, United States naval [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] arrived in Tokyo Bay with his fleet of [[Black Ships]] and came ashore at Kurihama, in southern Yokosuka, leading to the opening of diplomatic and trade relations between Japan and the United States. The [[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']] sailed from Yokosuka in 1860 with the [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|first Japanese diplomatic embassy to the United States]] in 1860.\n\n[[File:YokosukaConstruction.jpg|thumb|left|600px|Construction of the Yokosuka arsenal c.1870]]\n\nDuring the turbulent [[Bakumatsu period]], the Shogunate selected Yokosuka as the site for a modern naval base (\"[[Odaiba]]\"), and hired the [[oyatoi gaikokujin|French engineer]] [[L\u00e9once Verny]] in 1865 to oversee the development of [[shipbuilding]] facilities, beginning with Yokosuka Iron Foundry. [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] became the first modern [[arsenal]] to be created in Japan. The construction of the arsenal was the central point of a global modern infrastructure, that was to prove an important first step for the modernization of Japan's industry. Modern buildings, the Hashirimizu waterway, foundries, brick factories, and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established.\n\n===Meiji period to present===\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]], the arsenal was taken over by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and the area of modern Yokosuka was reorganized into Uraga Town and numerous villages within [[Miura District, Kanagawa|Miura District]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. Yokosuka Village was elevated to town status in 1878 and was made the capital of Miura District. In 1889, the [[Yokosuka Line]] railway was opened, connecting Yokosuka to Yokohama and Tokyo. Yokosuka was elevated to city status on February 15, 1907. From 1916, Oppama in Yokosuka was developed as the [[Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal]], and many of the combat aircraft subsequently operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] were developed or tested at Yokosuka. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal also continued to expand in the early 20th century, and its production included [[battleship]]s such as [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']], and [[aircraft carrier]]s such as [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]. Smaller warships were constructed at the privately owned [[Uraga Dock Company]]. [[Yokosuka Naval District]] was the home port of the [[IJN 1st Fleet]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] of 1923 caused severe damage to Yokosuka, including the naval base which lost two years' operations of oil supplies. The city continued to expand in 1933 with the annexation of neighboring Kinugasa Village and Taura Town in 1933 and Kurihama Village in 1937. In 1943, the city also annexed the neighboring towns and villages of Uraga, Kitashimoura, Okusu, Nagai and Takeyama, as well as [[Zushi, Kanagawa|Zushi]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[File:YokosukaBase.JPG|thumb|The [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|U.S. Navy base]] at Yokosuka]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Yokosuka was bombed on April 18, 1942 by American [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] in the [[Doolittle Raid]] with little damage as a retaliation to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Aside from minor sporadic tactical air raids by [[United States Navy]] aircraft, it was not bombed again during the war; however, from 1938 to 1945 more than 260 caves in more than 20 separate tunnel/cave networks were built throughout the area, with at least 27 kilometers of known tunnels within the grounds of Yokosuka Naval Base. Many more tunnels are scattered throughout the surrounding areas. During the war, these tunnels and caves provided areas in which work could be done in secrecy, safe from air attacks. A 500-bed hospital, a large electrical power generating facility, and a midget submarine factory and warehouse were among the many facilities built. American occupation forces landed at Yokosuka on August 30, 1945, after the [[surrender of Japan]], and the naval base has been used by the US Navy since that time.  The caves were used for storage and as an emergency shelter during the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/yokosuka-cave-network-dug-by-japanese-during-world-war-ii-sealed-1.30229|title=Yokosuka cave network dug by Japanese during World War II sealed|author=|date=|website=Stripes.com|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom the 1950s, [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka]] has been home port for the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], and played a critical support role in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrj/installations/cfa_yokosuka/about/history.html|title=history.html|author=|date=|website=Navy.mil|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref> Yokosuka was the site of many anti-war protests during the late 1960s and 1970s.

Following the defeat of the [[Later H\u014dj\u014d clan]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] transferred [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] to take control over the [[Kant\u014d region]], including Yokosuka in 1590.\n\nThe adventurer [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]] (inspiration for a character in the novel ''[[Sh\u014dgun (novel)|Sh\u014dgun]]''), the first Briton to set foot in Japan, arrived at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] aboard the Dutch trading vessel ''Liefde'' in 1600. In 1612, he was granted the title of [[samurai]] and a fief in Hemi within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka, due to his services to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. A monument to William Adams (called ''Miura Anjin'' in Japanese) is a local landmark in Yokosuka.\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]], Yokosuka ''[[tenry\u014d]]'' territory was controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], but administered through various ''[[hatamoto]]''. Due to its strategic location at the entrance to [[Edo Bay|Tokyo Bay]], the Shogunate established the post of Uraga ''Bugy\u014d'' in 1720, and all shipping into the bay was required to stop for inspection. As concerns over the increasing number of incursions by foreign vessels and attempts to end Japan's self-imposed [[sakoku|national seclusion policy]], the Shogunate established a number of [[coastal artillery]] batteries around Yokosuka, including an outpost at \u014ctsu in 1842. However, despite these efforts, in 1853, United States naval [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] arrived in Tokyo Bay with his fleet of [[Black Ships]] and came ashore at Kurihama, in southern Yokosuka, leading to the opening of diplomatic and trade relations between Japan and the United States. The [[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']] sailed from Yokosuka in 1860 with the [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|first Japanese diplomatic embassy to the United States]] in 1860.\n\n[[File:YokosukaConstruction.jpg|thumb|left|600px|Construction of the Yokosuka arsenal c.1870]]\n\nDuring the turbulent [[Bakumatsu period]], the Shogunate selected Yokosuka as the site for a modern naval base (\"[[Odaiba]]\"), and hired the [[oyatoi gaikokujin|French engineer]] [[L\u00e9once Verny]] in 1865 to oversee the development of [[shipbuilding]] facilities, beginning with Yokosuka Iron Foundry. [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] became the first modern [[arsenal]] to be created in Japan. The construction of the arsenal was the central point of a global modern infrastructure, that was to prove an important first step for the modernization of Japan's industry. Modern buildings, the Hashirimizu waterway, foundries, brick factories, and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established.\n\n===Meiji period to present===\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]], the arsenal was taken over by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and the area of modern Yokosuka was reorganized into Uraga Town and numerous villages within [[Miura District, Kanagawa|Miura District]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. Yokosuka Village was elevated to town status in 1878 and was made the capital of Miura District. In 1889, the [[Yokosuka Line]] railway was opened, connecting Yokosuka to Yokohama and Tokyo. Yokosuka was elevated to city status on February 15, 1907. From 1916, Oppama in Yokosuka was developed as the [[Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal]], and many of the combat aircraft subsequently operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] were developed or tested at Yokosuka. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal also continued to expand in the early 20th century, and its production included [[battleship]]s such as [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']], and [[aircraft carrier]]s such as [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]. Smaller warships were constructed at the privately owned [[Uraga Dock Company]]. [[Yokosuka Naval District]] was the home port of the [[IJN 1st Fleet]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] of 1923 caused severe damage to Yokosuka, including the naval base which lost two years' operations of oil supplies. The city continued to expand in 1933 with the annexation of neighboring Kinugasa Village and Taura Town in 1933 and Kurihama Village in 1937. In 1943, the city also annexed the neighboring towns and villages of Uraga, Kitashimoura, Okusu, Nagai and Takeyama, as well as [[Zushi, Kanagawa|Zushi]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[File:YokosukaBase.JPG|thumb|The [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|U.S. Navy base]] at Yokosuka]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Yokosuka was bombed on April 18, 1942 by American [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] in the [[Doolittle Raid]] with little damage as a retaliation to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Aside from minor sporadic tactical air raids by [[United States Navy]] aircraft, it was not bombed again during the war; however, from 1938 to 1945 more than 260 caves in more than 20 separate tunnel/cave networks were built throughout the area, with at least 27 kilometers of known tunnels within the grounds of Yokosuka Naval Base. Many more tunnels are scattered throughout the surrounding areas. During the war, these tunnels and caves provided areas in which work could be done in secrecy, safe from air attacks. A 500-bed hospital, a large electrical power generating facility, and a midget submarine factory and warehouse were among the many facilities built. American occupation forces landed at Yokosuka on August 30, 1945, after the [[surrender of Japan]], and the naval base has been used by the US Navy since that time.
