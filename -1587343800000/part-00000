borough in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]], settled in 1805 and chartered as a borough in 1853.  Catasauqua is a suburb of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of the state. Catasauqua is included in the Allentown-[[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]]-[[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], PA-[[New Jersey|NJ]] [[Lehigh Valley|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is also included in the [[New York City]]-[[Newark, New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|NY]]-[[New Jersey|NJ]]-[[Connecticut|CT]]-PA [[New York metropolitan area|Combined Statistical Area]].\n\nHistorically, manufacturing was Catasauqua's principal industry, and, in 1839, it was the location of the first manufactured [[anthracite iron]] in the nation.  Catasauqua's population in 1910 was 5,250.  The population was 6,436 at the 2010 census.  The word Catasauqua is shortened to \"Catty\" in local dialect when speaking of the place.\n\n==Geography==\nCatasauqua is located at {{Coord|40|39|11|N|75|28|3|W|type:city}} (40.652995, -75.467627).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  Nearby large communities include Allentown three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the south and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] seven miles (11 km) to the east.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 2.31%) of it is water.

Today, the George Taylor House is a [[National Historic Landmark]], a showpiece of the community's rich historical heritage.\n\nIn 1840, the anthracite iron industry was founded in what is now known as Catasauqua, originally [[Biery's Port Historic District|Biery's Port]], making it a birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Morning Call\">\n{{cite news\n  | url = http://articles.mcall.com/2002-04-15/news/3411673_1_foltz-variance-industrial-revolution\n  | title = Historical group finds new base\n  | first = Mariella\n  | last = Savidge\n  | date = April 15, 2002\n  | accessdate = September 15, 2010\n  | newspaper = The Morning Call\n  | location = [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]\n}}</ref>\nWelsh immigrant [[David Thomas (industrialist)|David Thomas]] relocated to the area and opened the [[Lehigh Crane Iron Company|Crane Iron Works]].  Remembered as \"the father of Catasauqua,\" Thomas initially named the community Craneville, after his former employer in [[Wales]].\n[[File:Catasauqua PA Bridge St Presby PHS0115.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Bridge Street Presbyterian Church in Catasauqua]]\nThe wealthy, generous Thomases were responsible for many sweeping changes to the prosperity of the community.  David Thomas founded the [[Presbyterian]] Church of Catasauqua, in which residents still worship today, and his wife Elizabeth donated money and land to found the Welsh Congregational Church, which no longer exists.  Thomas organized Catasauqua's first fire company, installed its first public water system, and served as its first burgess.\n\nIn 1854, the town was formally titled Catasauqua (pronounced \"Cat-uh-SAW-kwuh\"), from the [[Lenni Lenape]] language, meaning \"dry ground\" or \"thirsty ground.\"\n\nCatasauqua is home to two different neighborhoods listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  One is Biery's Port, located along the [[Lehigh River]] and named for an early family of prominence; the other is known as \"the mansion district,\" and comprises Victorian homes once owned by wealthy residents.\n\nBy 1900, Catasauqua boasted 5,000 residents, and had the highest percentage of self-made millionaires of any town in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1917, while many of the young men of the town served in World War I, Catasauqua became the first community in the United States to raise $1 million in [[war bonds]], earning it the nickname \"The Million Dollar Town\".\n\nCatasauqua observed its 150th anniversary of incorporation in 2004. In July 2014, the town also celebrated its 100th anniversary of the old home week celebration in 1914. The original old home week marked the 75th anniversary of the Lehigh Valley Crane Iron Works.\n\n==Education==\nThe Borough is served by the [[Catasauqua Area School District]].  The school district has 3 schools: Sheckler Elementary (grades k-4), Catasauqua Middle School (grades 5-8), and [[Catasauqua High School]] (grades 9-12).

The most prominent farm was owned by David Strawbridge, who named it Castle Shanahan. Over time, the farm would lend its name to the area, as \"Shanahan\" would evolve into \"Shannon\". In 1872, the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad line was completed, providing a direct link from [[Pittsburgh]] to the then-village of Castle Shannon. Development was stimulated by two years of free transportation and lumber transport given to anybody building a home.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04221/352632.stm Allegheny County Municipalities], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''; retrieved May 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1877, a second railroad was built from [[Finleyville, Pennsylvania|Finleyville]] through Castle Shannon to the [[West End (Pittsburgh)|West End]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 1909, the right of way through the valley containing Castle Shannon was purchased by the Pittsburgh Railroad. This helped lead to Castle Shannon becoming a center for coal mining, with eight mines in operation in 1904. The [[Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway|Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railroad]], still active today, came shortly afterward.\n\nThe First National Bank in Castle Shannon was the site of a much publicized bank robbery in 1917. $18,500 was taken in the robbery, of which $10,500 was immediately recovered from one man shot during the escape. The full sum was never recovered. A group of men gathered to chase down the robber to no avail. From that group, Elmet J Zeiler, a WWI Medal of Valor winner from the USA and France, and a double Purple Heart recipient, was named the first Chief of Police in Castle Shannon when the police department was formed.\n Castle Shannon was incorporated as a borough in 1919, formed from parts of [[Baldwin Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Baldwin Township]], [[Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Mt. Lebanon]], and [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Township]].\n\n==Government and Politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The most prominent farm was owned by David Strawbridge, who named it Castle Shanahan. Over time, the farm would lend its name to the area, as \"Shanahan\" would evolve into \"Shannon\". In 1872, the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad line was completed, providing a direct link from [[Pittsburgh]] to the then-village of Castle Shannon. Development was stimulated by two years of free transportation and lumber transport given to anybody building a home.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04221/352632.stm Allegheny County Municipalities], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''; retrieved May 15, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1877, a second railroad was built from [[Finleyville, Pennsylvania|Finleyville]] through Castle Shannon to the [[West End (Pittsburgh)|West End]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh. In 1909, the right of way through the valley containing Castle Shannon was purchased by the Pittsburgh Railroad. This helped lead to Castle Shannon becoming a center for coal mining, with eight mines in operation in 1904. The [[Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway|Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railroad]], still active today, came shortly afterward.\n\nThe First National Bank in Castle Shannon was the site of a much publicized bank robbery in 1917. $18,500 was taken in the robbery, of which $10,500 was immediately recovered from one man shot during the escape. The full sum was never recovered. A group of men gathered to chase down the robber to no avail. From that group, Elmet J Zeiler, a WWI Medal of Valor winner from the USA and France, and a double Purple Heart recipient, was named the first Chief of Police in Castle Shannon when the police department was formed.\n Castle Shannon was incorporated as a borough in 1919, formed from parts of [[Baldwin Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Baldwin Township]], [[Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Mt. Lebanon]], and [[Bethel Park, Pennsylvania|Bethel Township]].\n\n==Government and Politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

It is located to the south of the city of [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], and is predominantly agricultural, the principal products being [[grapes]] and [[olive]]s. It has a string of prestigious [[Winery|wineries]] that make up the so-called \"Wine Route\". The west part of the department is mountainous.\n\n== Origin of name ==\n\"Pocito\" means \"little pit\" or \"little hole\" and was named after a supposed \"little hole\" where the legendary India Mariana found golden nuggets (See below).\n\n== History ==\nNineteenth-century travelers would relate how Pocito was the first green land they encountered after leaving [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]].\n\nThe founder of the city is considered to be Dr. Jose Ignacio de la Roza, who divided up the land and planned the construction of the Pocito Canal.\n\nAfter the [[May Revolution]], the province was divided administratively into urban and rural areas. In 1834, Governor [[Jose Martin Yanz\u00f3n]] and his Minister, Timoteo Bustamente, established departments in the Province of San Juan. Two departments were divided into three districts and Pocito was included in the third quarter of the Department of the South.\n\nOn January 16, 1851, the Governor Nazario Benavides approved the \"Rules of Irrigation\". As a result, Mr. Rosendo Bernardo, the inspector of water, divided the province of Pocito into eight sections, which number was later increased to nine and then ten.\n\nOn December 9, 1869, during the government of [[Salvador Mar\u00eda del Carril|Dr. Jose Maria del Carril]], the Departmental System Act came into being. Under Article 36 of the Constitution, the Province was redivided into eighteen departments, the fifth of which was Pocito.\n\nOn March 29, 1876 the Pocito Municipal Board was established, the first commissioner being Julian Mazo.\n\n=== The Legend of India Mariana ===\nIn Pocitanas land, there once lived an old [[Huarpe people|Huarpe Indian]] called Mariana, whose only company and defense was a faithful dog. She lived under a [[carob]] tree and invariably smoked a cigar. She occupied the time telling stories of fabulous adventures to children who visited her, and sold \"brilliant pebbles\" to travelers and neighbors. These were nuggets of gold, which she always maintained came from the \"pocito\".\n\nOne dark night, some Spaniards wandering nearby were attracted by the glow of a lit cigarette. Great was their surprise when, approaching the carob tree, they were attacked by the faithful dog baring his canines. The robbers fled in fear, pursued by the woman who came out laughing from under the tree. That night an [[earthquake]] rocked the region and Mariana was seen no more. Her pocito was eagerly sought, but the source of the gold was never found.\n\n=== The Statue of Liberty ===\nAccording to some testimonies, it was Cantoni Federico who, as an officer of that time, visited France and had the \"Statue of Liberty\" created as ordered by national authorities. That is why the date 1810-1910 and the Argentine shield are seen on the left of the statue.\n\nFederico Cantoni ordered that the statue be sent to the province of San Juan, its intended location being the park. \nThis was done on the centenary of the \"First Cry of Freedom\", in May, 1810. On July 9, 1931, the engineer Mark Zalazar Pocito moved the statue and had it placed in the square that now bears the name \"Freedom Square\".\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Mapa del departamento Pocito.png| thumb | 250px | Map departmental division\n* ''1'' [[Quinto Cuartel]]\n* ''2'' zone adjacent to [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], (''[[Villa Barboza]] and [[Villa Nacusi|Nacusi]]'')\n* ''3'' [[Villa Aberastain|Aberastain]]\n* ''4'' [[La Rinconada]]\n* ''5'' [[Carpinter\u00eda (San Juan)|Carpinteria]]\n]]\n\nThe department is located in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|province of San Juan]], fifteen kilometers south of the capital, [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], and has an area of 1330 square kilometers. It shares borders:\n* To the north with the departments of [[Rawson Department, San Juan|Rawson]] and [[Rivadavia Department, San Juan|Rivadavia]]\n* To the south with the [[Sarmiento Department, San Juan|Sarmiento]]\n* To the east with the department of Rawson\n* To the west with the department of [[Zonda Department|Zonda]]\n\n===Relief===\n[[Image:Cerro Valdivia e iglesia de la Virgen del Tulum. San Juan. (EagLau--2008).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A church in the Valdivia hills located in the south of the department]]\nThe mountainous area located in the western sector is a series of ridges with a general north\u2013south direction. These include the Cordon de Las Lajas, the hills of La Rinconada and the Cordon of the Arrow. These are in turn attached to the main range, the Mountains of Zonda. The maximum elevation of over 2000 meters is on the western boundary of the department and the ground generally slopes towards the east. The formation of the Cerro Valdivia is isolated geologically. It is one of the foothills of the [[Sierras pampeanas]] formed in the [[Paleozoic]] era.\n\n<!--The ridges join above the Cerro Las Lajas, Jaguel, Cerro Flecha and Stone Sharpen and Cerritos Black. Within this highlight areas found negative and positive Quebrada Las Lajas and Gegenes and a series of lomadas such as carpentry and Portezuelo.--Incomprehensible section omitted--> \nIn the rest of the department there is deep soil resulting from water erosion of the mountainous area. Further eastward the soil is shallower and composed of fine material from the [[canal]] zone of the [[Quinto Cuartel]] division.

It is located to the south of the city of [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], and is predominantly agricultural, the principal products being [[grapes]] and [[olive]]s. It has a string of prestigious [[Winery|wineries]] that make up the so-called \"Wine Route\". The west part of the department is mountainous.\n\n== Origin of name ==\n\"Pocito\" means \"little pit\" or \"little hole\" and was named after a supposed \"little hole\" where the legendary India Mariana found golden nuggets (See below).\n\n== History ==\nNineteenth-century travelers would relate how Pocito was the first green land they encountered after leaving [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]].\n\nThe founder of the city is considered to be Dr. Jose Ignacio de la Roza, who divided up the land and planned the construction of the Pocito Canal.\n\nAfter the [[May Revolution]], the province was divided administratively into urban and rural areas. In 1834, Governor [[Jose Martin Yanz\u00f3n]] and his Minister, Timoteo Bustamente, established departments in the Province of San Juan. Two departments were divided into three districts and Pocito was included in the third quarter of the Department of the South.\n\nOn January 16, 1851, the Governor Nazario Benavides approved the \"Rules of Irrigation\". As a result, Mr. Rosendo Bernardo, the inspector of water, divided the province of Pocito into eight sections, which number was later increased to nine and then ten.\n\nOn December 9, 1869, during the government of [[Salvador Mar\u00eda del Carril|Dr. Jose Maria del Carril]], the Departmental System Act came into being. Under Article 36 of the Constitution, the Province was redivided into eighteen departments, the fifth of which was Pocito.\n\nOn March 29, 1876 the Pocito Municipal Board was established, the first commissioner being Julian Mazo.\n\n=== The Legend of India Mariana ===\nIn Pocitanas land, there once lived an old [[Huarpe people|Huarpe Indian]] called Mariana, whose only company and defense was a faithful dog. She lived under a [[carob]] tree and invariably smoked a cigar. She occupied the time telling stories of fabulous adventures to children who visited her, and sold \"brilliant pebbles\" to travelers and neighbors. These were nuggets of gold, which she always maintained came from the \"pocito\".\n\nOne dark night, some Spaniards wandering nearby were attracted by the glow of a lit cigarette. Great was their surprise when, approaching the carob tree, they were attacked by the faithful dog baring his canines. The robbers fled in fear, pursued by the woman who came out laughing from under the tree. That night an [[earthquake]] rocked the region and Mariana was seen no more. Her pocito was eagerly sought, but the source of the gold was never found.\n\n=== The Statue of Liberty ===\nAccording to some testimonies, it was Cantoni Federico who, as an officer of that time, visited France and had the \"Statue of Liberty\" created as ordered by national authorities. That is why the date 1810-1910 and the Argentine shield are seen on the left of the statue.\n\nFederico Cantoni ordered that the statue be sent to the province of San Juan, its intended location being the park. \nThis was done on the centenary of the \"First Cry of Freedom\", in May, 1810. On July 9, 1931, the engineer Mark Zalazar Pocito moved the statue and had it placed in the square that now bears the name \"Freedom Square\".\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Mapa del departamento Pocito.png| thumb | 250px | Map departmental division\n* ''1'' [[Quinto Cuartel]]\n* ''2'' zone adjacent to [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], (''[[Villa Barboza]] and [[Villa Nacusi|Nacusi]]'')\n* ''3'' [[Villa Aberastain|Aberastain]]\n* ''4'' [[La Rinconada]]\n* ''5'' [[Carpinter\u00eda (San Juan)|Carpinteria]]\n]]\n\nThe department is located in the [[San Juan Province, Argentina|province of San Juan]], fifteen kilometers south of the capital, [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], and has an area of 1330 square kilometers. It shares borders:\n* To the north with the departments of [[Rawson Department, San Juan|Rawson]] and [[Rivadavia Department, San Juan|Rivadavia]]\n* To the south with the [[Sarmiento Department, San Juan|Sarmiento]]\n* To the east with the department of Rawson\n* To the west with the department of [[Zonda Department|Zonda]]\n\n===Relief===\n[[Image:Cerro Valdivia e iglesia de la Virgen del Tulum. San Juan. (EagLau--2008).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A church in the Valdivia hills located in the south of the department]]\nThe mountainous area located in the western sector is a series of ridges with a general north-south direction. These include the Cordon de Las Lajas, the hills of La Rinconada and the Cordon of the Arrow. These are in turn attached to the main range, the Mountains of Zonda. The maximum elevation of over 2000 meters is on the western boundary of the department and the ground generally slopes towards the east. The formation of the Cerro Valdivia is isolated geologically. It is one of the foothills of the [[Sierras pampeanas]] formed in the [[Paleozoic]] era.\n\n<!--The ridges join above the Cerro Las Lajas, Jaguel, Cerro Flecha and Stone Sharpen and Cerritos Black. Within this highlight areas found negative and positive Quebrada Las Lajas and Gegenes and a series of lomadas such as carpentry and Portezuelo.--Incomprehensible section omitted--> \nIn the rest of the department there is deep soil resulting from water erosion of the mountainous area. Further eastward the soil is shallower and composed of fine material from the [[canal]] zone of the [[Quinto Cuartel]] division. This area is used as arable land and is irrigated through a network of channels that flow from the San Juan River.\n\nThe flora is composed of carob, [[Larrea|jarilla]] (in the lower parts of the mountains), cha\u00f1ares, aragua (on the slopes), [[Acacia aroma|tuscas]], chilcas and pichanas (in the wet valleys).\n\nAmong the animals living here are [[guanaco]]s, [[vicuna]]s, [[fox]]es, mice, [[Andean condor|Andean condors]], lechuzos, chimangos, [[partridge]]s, [[Elegant crested tinamou|martinetas]], [[hare]]s and wild [[rabbit]]s.\n\n===Hydrography===\n[[Image:Canal de regadio, Pocito, San Juan.jpg|thumb | 200px | Canal regadio]]\nThe irrigation network originates from channels that run from north to south and draw their water from the right bank of the [[San Juan River (Argentina)|San Juan River]].

He named the lands after his [[Sutton Scarsdale|ancestral home]] in [[Derbyshire]], England. The first local census of 1712 counted twelve inhabitants, including seven African [[slaves]]. When Caleb died in 1721, his daughters inherited the property. The estate was broken up in 1774, and the town was officially founded on March 7, 1788.\n\nThe town saw fighting during the [[American Revolution]] when the Continental and British armies clashed briefly at what is now the junction of Garden Road and Mamaroneck Road. The British commander, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], lodged at a farmhouse on Garden Road that remains standing. Scarsdale's wartime history formed the basis for [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s novel, ''[[The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground|The Spy]]'', written while the author lived at the Angevine Farm in the present-day Heathcote section of town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarsdale.com/Home/HistoryofScarsdale.aspx|title=History of Scarsdale|work=scarsdale.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1790\u20131945===\nAccording to the first federal census in 1790, the town's population was 281. By 1840, that number had declined to 255\u2014the vast majority farmers and farm workers. In 1846, the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] connected Scarsdale to New York City, leading to an influx of commuters.\n\n[[File:Old Oak Tree - Scarsdale Woman's Club - Scarsdale, NY - September 2012.jpg|thumbnail|right|Scarsdale Woman's Club - Historic Oak Tree (September 2012)]]\n\nThe Arthur Suburban Home Company purchased a {{convert|150|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in 1891 and converted it into a subdevelopment of one-family dwellings, starting a transformation of the community from rural to suburban. Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Woman's Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). [[Scarsdale High School]] and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1912, and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918. The first store in Scarsdale opened on the corner of Popham Road and Garth Road in 1912. By 1915, the population approached 3000. By 1930, that number approached 10,000.\n\nIn 1940, [[Nazi Germany|German]] agent [[Gerhardt Alois Westrick]] secretly met with American business leaders at his Scarsdale home until public pressure\u2014a reaction to articles in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' produced by [[British Security Coordination]] in New York<ref>''The Secret History of British intelligence in the Americas, 1940\u20131945'' pp. 56\u201357</ref>\u2014drove his family from the community.<ref>\"Germand Forced to Give Up His Scarsdale Home\", ''The Evening Standard'', August 3, 1940</ref><ref>\"WESTRICK TO QUIT HOME IN SCARSDALE; Nazi Agent, Under Investigation for Car License Application, Drives 'Perfectly' in Test\", ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1940</ref> He was subsequently deported for pursuing activities unfriendly to the United States.\n\n===1945\u2013present===\n[[Image:harwoodcourtscarsdale.jpg|thumb|Harwood Court]]\nScarsdale became the subject of national controversy in the 1950s when a \"Committee of Ten\" led by [[Otto Dohrenwend]] alleged \"[[Red Scare|Communist infiltration]]\" in the public schools.<ref>SCARSDALE HEARS RED CHARGE AGAIN; School Head Tells Citizens' Group Choice Is Among Bare, Rich or Dictated Programs, The New York Times, April 8, 1952</ref> A thorough investigation by the town rejected these claims. This same group, known as the Scarsdale Citizens Committee, sued to prevent a benefit for the [[Freedom Riders]] from taking place at the public high school in 1963 because some of the performers ([[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Pete Seeger]]) were allegedly \"communist sympathizers and subversives.\"<ref>O'Connor, Carol A. A Sort of Utopia, Scarsdale: 1891\u20131981, published 1983</ref>\n\nAnother controversy enveloped the town in 1961, when the Scarsdale Country Club, headed by Charles S. McCallister, refused to allow a young man who had converted from [[Judaism]] into the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], Michael Cunningham Hernstadt, to escort a young woman, Pamela Nottage, to her debut at the club. At the time, it was the club's policy to prohibit Jews from the premises.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Scarsdale Parish Rector Limits Communion Over Anti-Semitism by John W.

Hilton serving as the first librarian.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe last of the town's five elementary schools, Heathcote School, opened in September 1953. The $1,000,000 architectural landmark was designed by Perkins & Will of Chicago. Walter B.

Scarsdale]]'' (1985), that established the so-called \"reindeer rule\" regarding public [[nativity scene]]s and upheld the right of local religious groups to place cr\u00e8ches on public property.\n\nScarsdale was involved in another [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in 1985, ''[[Board of Trustees of Scarsdale v. McCreary]]'', concerning the display of privately sponsored nativity scenes on public property.\n\nThe [[Caleb Hyatt House]], [[Scarsdale Railroad Station]], [[Scarsdale Woman's Club]], [[United States Post Office (Scarsdale, New York)|United States Post Office]], and [[Wayside Cottage]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>\n\n====Politics====\nScarsdale selects its Board of Trustees using a nonpartisan system that dates back to 1911. Candidates for office are privately interviewed by a diversely composed committee and then nominated for office. New York State law mandates that these nominees must be democratically elected, however, nominated candidates are rarely contested in the general election. The coordinating Scarsdale Citizens' Non-Partisan Party states \"The Scarsdale Citizens' Non-Partisan Party promotes the election of non-partisan candidates for village mayor, village trustees and village justice.

He named the lands after his [[Sutton Scarsdale|ancestral home]] in [[Derbyshire]], England. The first local census of 1712 counted twelve inhabitants, including seven African [[slaves]]. When Caleb died in 1721, his daughters inherited the property. The estate was broken up in 1774, and the town was officially founded on March 7, 1788.\n\nThe town saw fighting during the [[American Revolution]] when the Continental and British armies clashed briefly at what is now the junction of Garden Road and Mamaroneck Road. The British commander, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], lodged at a farmhouse on Garden Road that remains standing. Scarsdale's wartime history formed the basis for [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s novel, ''[[The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground|The Spy]]'', written while the author lived at the Angevine Farm in the present-day Heathcote section of town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarsdale.com/Home/HistoryofScarsdale.aspx|title=History of Scarsdale|work=scarsdale.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1790\u20131945===\nAccording to the first federal census in 1790, the town's population was 281.

Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Woman's Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). [[Scarsdale High School]] and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1912, and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918.

In 2003, she is stationed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|U.S. embassy in Pakistan]]. She and CIA officer Dan attend the [[black site]] interrogations of [[Ammar al-Baluchi|Ammar]], a detainee with suspected links to several of the [[hijackers in the September 11 attacks]] and who is subjected to [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|approved torture interrogation techniques]]. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in [[Saudi Arabia]], but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]]. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] (Yoav Levi) and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.\n\nIn 2009, during the [[Camp Chapman attack]], Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica ([[Jennifer Ehle]]) is killed by a suicide bomber. A case manager that liked the Abu Ahmed lead shares with her an interrogation with a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier: Ibrahim Sayeed traveled under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]]. She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Ahmed is that of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining Ammar's account of Ahmed's \"death\" in 2001.\n\nA Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeed's mother for a [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo Bicolore]]. Maya and her CIA team in Pakistan use electronic methods to eventually pinpoint a caller in a moving vehicle who exhibits behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity (which Maya calls [[tradecraft]], thus confirming that the subject is likely a senior courier). They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan, near the [[Pakistan Military Academy]]. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C. as her cover is believed blown.\n\nThe CIA puts the compound under surveillance, but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The President's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President [[Barack Obama]], the CIA director, ([[James Gandolfini]]) , holds a meeting of his senior officers, who estimate that bin Laden is 60\u201380% likely to be in the compound. Maya, also in the meeting, places her confidence at 100%.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] flies two [[stealth helicopter]]s from Afghanistan into Pakistan with members of [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU]] and the CIA's [[Special Activities Division|SAC/SOG]] to raid the compound. The SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people in the compound, including whom they believe is bin Laden. At a U.S. base in [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, Maya confirms the identity of the corpse. \n\nShe boards a military transport back to the U.S., the sole passenger. She is asked where she wants to go and begins to cry.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n'''CIA'''\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Maya, a [[CIA]] [[intelligence analyst]]<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|title=Bin Laden Film's Focus Is Facts, Not Flash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/movies/zero-dark-thirty-by-kathryn-bigelow-focuses-on-facts.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 23, 2012|first1=Michael|last1=Cieply|first2=Brooks|last2=Barnes}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Dan, a CIA [[intelligence officer]]\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Jessica, a senior CIA analyst\n* [[Mark Strong]] as George, a senior CIA supervisor<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Joseph Bradley, Islamabad CIA [[Station Chief]]\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[Leon Panetta|Leon Panetta]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Jack, a CIA analyst\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Steve, a CIA analyst\n* [[Fredric Lehne]] as 'The Wolf', a CIA section chief\n* [[John Barrowman]] as Jeremy, a CIA executive\n* [[Jessie Collins]] as Debbie, a CIA analyst\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Larry, a CIA [[Special Activities Division|SAD/SOG]] operative\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Hakim, a CIA SAD/SOG operative\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as John, a CIA SAD/SOG operative\n\n'''US Navy'''\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Patrick, [[DEVGRU]] (SEAL Team 6) team leader\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Justin, DEVGRU operator.

The two were about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed.\n\nThey immediately shelved the film they had been working on and redirected their focus, essentially starting from scratch. \"But a lot of the homework I'd done for the first script and a lot of the contacts I made, carried over,\" Boal remarked during an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. He added, \"The years I had spent talking to military and intelligence operators involved in [[counter-terrorism]] was helpful in both projects. Some of the sourcing I had developed long, long ago continued to be helpful for this version.\"<ref name=\"EW1\"/>\n\nAlong with painstakingly recreating the historic night-vision raid on the Abbottabad compound, the script and the film stress the little-reported role of the tenacious young female CIA officer who tracked down Osama bin Laden. Screenwriter Boal said that while researching for the film, \"I heard through the grapevine that women played a big role in the CIA in general and in this team. I heard that a woman was there on the night of the raid as one of the CIA's liaison officers on the ground \u2013 and that was the start of it.\" He then turned up stories about a young case officer who was recruited out of college, who had spent her entire career chasing bin Laden. Maya's tough-minded, monomaniacal persona, Boal said, is \"based on a real person, but she also represents the work of a lot of other women.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/secrets-of-zero-dark-thirty-20130111 |author=Hill, Logan |title=Secrets of 'Zero Dark Thirty' |work=Rolling Stone |date=January 11, 2013}}</ref> In December 2014 [[Jane Mayer]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that \"Maya\" was modeled in part after CIA officer [[Alfreda Frances Bikowsky]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unidentified-queen-torture |last=Mayer |first=Jane |title=The Unidentified Queen of Torture |publisher=The New Yorker |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nParts of the film were shot at [[PEC University of Technology]] in [[Chandigarh]], [[India]].<ref name=\"trib20120401\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120401/ttlife1.htm#3|title=The dream set|date=1 April 2012|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Kabir-Khan-recreates-Pakistan-in-Punjab-for-Phantom/articleshow/48556722.cms|title=Kabir Khan recreates Pakistan in Punjab for 'Phantom' - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> Some parts of Chandigarh were designed to look like [[Lahore]] and [[Abbottabad]] in Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden was found and killed on May 2, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-03/news-interviews/31117436_1_abbottabad-horse-carts-political-posters |title=Chandigarh turns Lahore |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=March 3, 2012}}</ref> Parts of the film were shot in [[Mani Majra]].<ref name=\"TOI20130212\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-12/cinema/37058171_1_burqa-clad-women-and-men-international-film-zero-dark-thirty|title=Manimajra residents hope 'Zero Dark Thirty' will win Oscar|date=Feb 12, 2013|work=The Times of India|accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> Local members of [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] parties protested, expressing anti-bin Laden and anti-Pakistan sentiments as they objected to Pakistani locations being portrayed on Indian soil.<ref>{{cite news |title=VHP, Shiv Sena protest against Osama film |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-03/chandigarh/31119310_1_shiv-sena-protest-zero-dark-thirty-vhp |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=March 3, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Reuters-Williams>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Matthias|title=Hindus protest bin Laden film shoot in north India|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/03/06/film-us-india-pakistan-film-idINTRE82110220120306|accessdate=September 5, 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>\nFor a lone scene shot in [[Poland]], the city of [[Gda\u0144sk]] was reportedly offended for depicting it as a location for the CIA's clandestine and dark operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmapia.com/published/scenes/cia-black-site|title=Scene location for CIA Black Site|publisher=Filmapia}}</ref>\n\nNational security expert [[Peter Bergen]], who reviewed an early cut of the film as an unpaid adviser, said at the time that the film's torture scenes \"were overwrought\".

Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before&nbsp;\u2013 the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals&nbsp;\u2013 has led to this.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=By Any Means Necessary: Jessica Chastain in 'Zero Dark Thirty'|work=The New York Times|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/movies/jessica-chastain-in-zero-dark-thirty.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Richard Corliss]]'s review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called it \"a fine\" movie and \"a police procedural on the grand scale\", saying it \"blows ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' out of the water\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/11/25/zero-dark-thirty-the-girl-who-got-bin-laden/#ixzz2DHtkIabH|title=Zero Dark Thirty: The Girl Who Got bin Laden|accessdate=November 25, 2012 | work=Time|date=November 25, 2012}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, \"it could well be the most impressive film Bigelow has made, as well as possibly her most personal.\" Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said: \"The ultra-professional result may be easier to respect than enjoy, but there's no denying its power.\" Critic Katey Rich of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said: \"Telling a nearly three-hour story with an ending everyone knows, Bigelow and Boal have managed to craft one of the most intense and intellectually challenging films of the year.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/04/zero-dark-thirty-review-kathryn-bigelow|title=Zero Dark Thirty: First Look |work=The Guardian |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |location=London |first=Katey |last=Rich}}</ref> Calling ''Zero Dark Thirty'' \"a milestone in post-Sept. 11 cinema\", critic [[A.

In 2003, she is stationed at the [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|U.S. embassy in Pakistan]]. She and CIA officer Dan attend the [[black site]] interrogations of [[Ammar al-Baluchi|Ammar]], a detainee with suspected links to several of the [[hijackers in the September 11 attacks]] and who is subjected to [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|approved torture interrogation techniques]]. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in [[Saudi Arabia]], but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]]. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between [[Abu Faraj al-Libbi]] (Yoav Levi) and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.\n\nIn 2009, during the [[Camp Chapman attack]], Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica ([[Jennifer Ehle]]) is killed by a suicide bomber. A case manager that liked the Abu Ahmed lead shares with her an interrogation with a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier: Ibrahim Sayeed traveled under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]]. She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Ahmed is that of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining Ammar's account of Ahmed's \"death\" in 2001.\n\nA Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeed's mother for a [[Lamborghini]] [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Gallardo Bicolore]]. Maya and her CIA team in Pakistan use electronic methods to eventually pinpoint a caller in a moving vehicle who exhibits behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity (which Maya calls [[tradecraft]], thus confirming that the subject is likely a senior courier). They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan, near the [[Pakistan Military Academy]]. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C. as her cover is believed blown.\n\nThe CIA puts the compound under surveillance, but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The President's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President [[Barack Obama]], the CIA director, ([[James Gandolfini]]) , holds a meeting of his senior officers, who estimate that bin Laden is 60\u201380% likely to be in the compound. Maya, also in the meeting, places her confidence at 100%.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] flies two [[stealth helicopter]]s from Afghanistan into Pakistan with members of [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU]] and the CIA's [[Special Activities Division|SAC/SOG]] to raid the compound. The SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people in the compound, including whom they believe is bin Laden. At a U.S. base in [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan, Maya confirms the identity of the corpse. \n\nShe boards a military transport back to the U.S., the sole passenger. She is asked where she wants to go and begins to cry.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n'''CIA'''\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Maya, a [[CIA]] [[intelligence analyst]]<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|title=Bin Laden Film's Focus Is Facts, Not Flash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/movies/zero-dark-thirty-by-kathryn-bigelow-focuses-on-facts.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 23, 2012|first1=Michael|last1=Cieply|first2=Brooks|last2=Barnes}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Dan, a CIA [[intelligence officer]]\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Jessica, a senior CIA analyst\n* [[Mark Strong]] as George, a senior CIA supervisor<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as Joseph Bradley, Islamabad CIA [[Station Chief]]\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[Leon Panetta|Leon Panetta]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Jack, a CIA analyst\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Steve, a CIA analyst\n* [[Fredric Lehne]] as 'The Wolf', a CIA section chief\n* [[John Barrowman]] as Jeremy, a CIA executive\n* [[Jessie Collins]] as Debbie, a CIA analyst\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Larry, a CIA [[Special Activities Division|SAD/SOG]] operative\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Hakim, a CIA SAD/SOG operative\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as John, a CIA SAD/SOG operative\n\n'''US Navy'''\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Patrick, [[DEVGRU]] (SEAL Team 6) team leader\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Justin, DEVGRU operator.

The two were about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed.\n\nThey immediately shelved the film they had been working on and redirected their focus, essentially starting from scratch. \"But a lot of the homework I'd done for the first script and a lot of the contacts I made, carried over,\" Boal remarked during an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. He added, \"The years I had spent talking to military and intelligence operators involved in [[counter-terrorism]] was helpful in both projects. Some of the sourcing I had developed long, long ago continued to be helpful for this version.\"<ref name=\"EW1\"/>\n\nAlong with painstakingly recreating the historic night-vision raid on the Abbottabad compound, the script and the film stress the little-reported role of the tenacious young female CIA officer who tracked down Osama bin Laden. Screenwriter Boal said that while researching for the film, \"I heard through the grapevine that women played a big role in the CIA in general and in this team. I heard that a woman was there on the night of the raid as one of the CIA's liaison officers on the ground \u2013 and that was the start of it.\" He then turned up stories about a young case officer who was recruited out of college, who had spent her entire career chasing bin Laden.

Several different board representations exist.  Chess programs often utilize more than one board representation at different times, for efficiency.  Execution efficiency and memory footprint are the primary factors in choosing a board representation; secondary considerations are effort required to code, test and debug the application.\n\nEarly programs used piece lists and square lists, both array based.  Most modern implementations use a more elaborate but more efficient bit array approach called ''bitboards'' which map bits of a 64-bit word or double word to squares of the board.\n\n==Board state==\n\nA full description of a chess position, i.e. the position \"state\", must contain the following elements:\n\n* The location of each piece on the board\n* Whose turn it is to move\n* Status of the [[fifty-move rule|50-move draw rule]].  The name of this is sometimes a bit confusing, as it is 50 moves by each player, and therefore 100 half-moves, or ply.  For example, if the previous 80 half-moves passed without a capture or a pawn move, the fifty-move rule will kick in after another twenty half-moves.\n* Whether either player is permanently disqualified to [[castling|castle]], both [[kingside]] and [[queenside]].\n* If an [[en passant]] capture is possible.\n\nBoard representation typically does not include the status of the [[threefold repetition]] [[draw (chess)|draw]] rule.  To determine this rule, a complete history of the game from the last irreversible action (capture, pawn movement, or castling) needs to be maintained, and so, is generally tracked in separate data structures.\n\nThe board state may also contain secondary derived information like which pieces attack a square; for squares containing pieces, which spaces are attacked or guarded by that piece; which pieces are pinned; and other convenient or temporary state.\n\nThe board state is associated with each node of the game tree, representing a position arrived at by a move, whether that move was played over the board, or generated as part of the program's search. It is conceptually local to the node, but may be defined globally, and incrementally updated from node to node as the tree is traversed.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Array based===\n====Piece lists====\nSome of the very earliest chess programs working with extremely limited amounts of memory maintained serial lists (arrays) of the pieces in a conveniently searchable order, like largest to smallest; associated with each piece was its location on the board as well as other information, such as squares representing its legal moves. There were several lists, one set for white pieces and another for black pieces.  The lists were usually divided into pieces and pawns.  This was a compact representation because most squares of the board are unoccupied, but inefficient because acquiring information about the relationship of pieces to the board or to each other was tedious.  Piece lists are still used by many of today's programs in conjunction with a separate board representation structure, to give serial access to the pieces without searching the board.\n\n====Square list====\nOne of the simplest ways to represent a board is to create an 8x8 two-dimensional [[array data structure|array]] (or, equivalently, a 64 element one-dimensional array). Each array element would identify what piece occupied the given square, or alternatively, if the square is empty. A common encoding is to consider 0 as empty, positive as white, and negative as black, e.g., white [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] +1, black pawn \u22121, white [[knight (chess)|knight]] +2, black knight \u22122, white [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] +3, and so on.  This scheme is called ''mailbox'' addressing.\n\nA problem with this approach arises during move generation. Each move has to be checked to ensure it is on the board, significantly slowing down the process. One solution is to use a 12x12 array instead, with the outer edges filled with, say, the value 99. During move generation, the operation to check for a piece on the destination square will also indicate whether the destination square is off the board.<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/><ref name=\"Frey1977\">{{citation|title=Chess Skill In Man and Machine|editor-last=Frey|editor-first=Peter W.|origyear=1977|year=1983|publisher=Springer\u2013Verlag|chapter=An introduction to computer chess|pages=55\u201356}}</ref>\n\nBetter memory usage can be achieved with a 10x12 array, which provides the same functionalities as a 12x12 one by overlapping the leftmost and rightmost edge files (which are marked as off-the-board).<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/><ref name=\"Frey1977\"/>  Some chess engines use 16x16 arrays to improve the speed of the rank and file number conversion and allow some special coding tricks for attacks etc.\n\n====0x88 method====\n{{main|0x88}}\nThe 0x88 method takes advantage of the fact that a chessboard's 8x8 dimensions are an even power of two (i.e. 8 squared).  The board uses a one-dimensional array of size 16x8 = 128, numbered 0 to 127 rather than an array of size 64. It is basically two boards next to each other, the actual board on the left while the board on the right would contain illegal territory. The binary layout for a legal board coordinate's rank and file within the array is <kbd>0rrr0fff</kbd> (The r's are the 3 bits used to represent the rank. The f's for the file). For example, 0x71 (binary <kbd>01110001</kbd>) would represent the square b8 (in [[Algebraic notation (chess)|Algebraic notation]]). When generating moves from the main board, one can check that a destination square is on the main board before consulting the array simply by [[mask (computing)|AND]]ing the square number with [[hexadecimal]] 0x88 (binary <kbd>10001000</kbd>). A non-zero result indicates that the square is off the main board. In addition, the difference between two squares' coordinates uniquely determines whether those two squares are along the same row, column, or diagonal (a common query used for determining check).<ref name=\"Hyatt\"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026130204/http://www.seanet.com/~brucemo/topics/0x88.htm 0x88 method. Bruce Moreland]</ref>\n\n===Bitboards===\n{{main|Bitboard}}\nA more efficient but more elaborate board representation than the array-based structures is the [[bitboard]]. A bitboard is a 64-bit sequence of bits (0 or 1), which indicates the absence or presence (false or true) of some state of each space on the board. A board position can then be represented using a series of bitboards. For example, a series of bitboards for each piece type, for each side, can represent the board position.\n\nThe advantage to this representation is the ability to use [[bit parallel]] operations upon the [[64-bit]] entities instead of iteration to manipulate and derive information about the state of the board. This makes maximal use of the hardware available, especially as 64-bit processors have become mainstream.\n\nA substantive advantage of bitboards is that enables maps for the spaces attacked by each type of piece on each space of the board to be pre-collated and stored in a table, so that possible moves of the piece can be retrieved in a single memory fetch of the attack map for the square on which the piece resides which, excluding spaces occupied by friendly pieces (one bitwise operation), yields the legal moves of the piece.  But the moves of the sliding pieces (rooks, bishops, queens) are indeterminate because the moves of these pieces depend on the configuration of other pieces on the board.  So special and complex data structures have been devised to represent their moves.\n\n==== Rotated bitboards ====\nRotated bitboards is a move generation technique for the sliding pieces that uses rotated copies of a bitboard to place spaces (bits) in a file or diagonal into adjacent bits analogous to the bits representing a rank.  These bits can be extracted and used as an index into a table to obtain the map of spaces attacked by these pieces.  The bitboard is rotated 90\u00b0 for file indexing and either 45\u00b0 or -45\u00b0 for diagonal indexing.  Rotating a chessboard is conceptually challenging, and rotating a bitboard is computational inelegant, but the transformation avoids serially enumerating the piece moves, or a lengthy sequence of shifting and masking a bitboard of the attack map of the piece to take into account the board configuration.\n\n====Direct lookup====\nThe masked ranks, files and diagonals of sliding pieces can be used via a [[hash function]] to directly index a table of precomputed attack vectors based on the occupancy bits in the masked portion.  One such scheme that uses a perfect hash function along with tricks to minimize the potential size of the table that must be stored in memory, is called \"magic bitboards\".\n\n=== Transposition table ===\nA [[transposition table]] is a cache of previously seen positions, and associated [[evaluation function|evaluations]], in a [[game tree]] generated by a computer game playing program. For fast searching of the table, a hash function may be used, such as [[Zobrist hashing]], to speed finding matching boards.<ref>Albert Lindsey Zobrist, [https://www.cs.wisc.edu/techreports/1970/TR88.pdf ''A New Hashing Method with Application for Game Playing''], Tech.

This healthy diet includes a wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and [[cruciferous vegetables]] like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including \u201cfast foods\u201d and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity.

This healthy diet includes a wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and [[cruciferous vegetables]] like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy rich foods, including \u201cfast foods\u201d and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity.
