Her father, [[Othman A. Abbott|Othman Abbott]], was a lawyer and Nebraska's first [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nebraska|Lieutenant Governor]] (1877\u20131879).

However, her family could not afford to send her to college due to a drought which struck Nebraska and eventually led to an economic depression. Instead of going to college immediately, Abbott began to teach high school in Grand Island, [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Nebraska]].<ref name=\":0\"/> Determined to receive a college education, Abbott took correspondence courses and night classes until she was able to afford to fully enroll. Abbott enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln|University of Nebraska]], receiving her degree in 1901. She continued to teach for two more years and was eventually awarded a fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edith-Abbott|title=Edith Abbott {{!}} American social worker|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=April 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref> While at the University of Chicago working on her doctorate, she met Professor [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]].

She learned from social reformers [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], who championed new approaches to dealing with poverty. The Webbs influenced the direction of Abbott's career. The Webbs were in favour of repealing the British \"poor laws\"\u2014which they viewed as demeaning to people in poverty\u2014and they supported establishing programs to eliminate poverty.<ref name=\"Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 1\">{{cite book|author1=Sicherman, Barbara|author2=Carol Hurd Green|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|year=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627338|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich_0/page/1 1]|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich_0/page/1}}</ref> While studying in London, Abbott lived part of the time in a social reformers' settlement in a poverty-stricken area of the East End, where she gained experience in social work.<ref name=\"Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 1\"/>\n\n== Early career ==\n\nAbbott returned to the United States in 1907 after her years studying in London, and took a job teaching economics at [[Wellesley College]]. Though her job at Wellesley was highly regarded for a woman with a Ph.D at the time, she desired to return to [[Chicago]].

Grace and Edith Abbott became great additions to the reform-minded community as they contributed significantly through their commitment to social reform advocacy and scholarship of statistical research.\n\nThe long-lasting professional partnership between Abbott and Breckinridge first started during their years together at the School of Civics and Philanthropy. They shared a common interest in detailed statistical investigations of contemporary social problems which they believed they could use to spark reform advocacy. As a result of her experience in statistical research, following a crime wave in Chicago in 1914 Abbott was commissioned to investigate statistics on crime and criminals in the city. This led to a ground-breaking report titled \"Statistics Relating to Crime in Chicago\", published in 1915.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sharonlohr.com/blog/2019/8/16/how-did-edith-abbott-come-to-write-about-crime-statistics-in-1915|title=How Did Edith Abbott Come to Write about Crime Statistics in 1915?

(A follow-up study, The Tenements of Chicago, 1908\u20131935, was published in 1936); The Delinquent Child and the Home (1912), a study of Chicago's juvenile court; and Truancy and Non-Attendance in the Chicago Schools (1917), an investigation which led them to support compulsory school attendance and child labour legislation. In 1927, in dedication to the \"scientific and professional interests of social work\", Abbott and Breckinridge jointly established the distinguished academic journal, ''[[Social Service Review]]'', published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith the joint efforts of Abbott and Breckinridge, in 1920, the [[University of Chicago]]'s Board of Trustees voted to rename the School the University of Chicago Graduate School of Social Service Administration.

She became the first US woman to become the dean of an American graduate school. Abbott, along with Breckinridge, transformed the field of social work by emphasizing the importance of formal education in social work and the need to include field experience as part of the training. They designed a curriculum that heavily emphasized social statistics as the historical, legal, economic and political root causes of social problems and public welfare efforts. In addition, they fought for the professional status of social work. In 1931, Abbott collected many of her papers, addresses and speeches on social service education and created a single volume entitled Social Welfare and Professional Education (1931, revised and enlarged in 1942).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAbbott focused her attention oner her students to portray the basic principles that can be transmitted to students. She states these principles must derive from \"a critical examination of the methods used to produce certain results and a searching equally for the causes of apparent failure and apparent success.\"<ref name=\"Wisner 1958 1\u201310\">{{Cite journal|last=Wisner|first=Elizabeth|date=1958|title=Edith Abbott's Contributions to Social Work Education|jstor=30016157|journal=Social Service Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1\u201310|doi=10.1086/640389}}</ref> Abbott derived a curriculum for students that desired a career in social work.<ref name=\"Wisner 1958 1\u201310\"/>\n\n== Later career ==\nAbbott was a prominent immigration expert, working for reforms that would end exploitation of immigrants.

She also stressed the importance of a [[public welfare]] administration, the need for a more humane [[social welfare]] system, and the responsibility of the state in addressing social problems.\n\nMany of the contributions during Abbott's career were dedicated to addressing welfare reform and adopting more humane standards for welfare treatment. In 1926, Abbott helped establish the Cook County Bureau of Public Welfare. Abbott and Breckinridge founded the Social Service Review in 1927, which, still administered by the University of Chicago, \"is committed to examining social welfare policy and practice and evaluating its effects.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/a/abbott_e.htm|title=Edith Abbott|website=www.naswfoundation.org|access-date=April 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912015959/http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/a/abbott_e.htm|archive-date=September 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Throughout the Great Depression Edith Abbott worked  alongside her sister to combat a wide array of social ills, from the mistreatment of immigrants to the abuses of child labor.

Abbott was known to be a confidante and special consultant to [[Harry Hopkins]], adviser to President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1950, Abbott was known to have been appointed to a single case on the California Supreme Court, making her the first woman to sit on the state's supreme court.<ref name=\"Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 1\" />\n\nThe death of Edith's sister, Grace, in 1939 caused Edith to become quarrelsome and lonely, and slowly she began to withdraw herself from public life. In 1941, she published her final book, Public Assistance, and in 1942 she officially retired as the Dean of the School of Social Service Administration. Edith Abbott spent her remaining years living with her family in their home in Grand Island, Nebraska, where she died of [[pneumonia]] in 1957. She left the bulk of her estate to the Grand Island Public Library. She also left a trust for a collection of nonfiction books in memory of her mother, Elizabeth Abbott. At the time of Edith Abbott's death in 1957, Wayne McMillen of [[Social Service Review]] wrote, \"History will include her name among the handful of leaders who have made enduring contributions to the field of education. Social work has now taken its place as an established profession. She, more than any other one person, gave direction to the education required for that profession.

The book was a milestone in feminist economy writings. Ultimately Women and Industry looked at the wages and labor history from an economic standpoint while at the same time keeping the social causations at the center of her research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Edith|date=July 1, 2013|title=Women in Industry [Hardback]|url=https://vernonpress.com/title?id=1#.WOYqZRLytp8}}</ref>\n\n[https://archive.org/stream/womeninindustrys00abbo#page/n3/mode/2up ''Women in industry; a study in American economic history''.

The issues she pointed to were those who were imprisoned because they could not make bail, those who are determined guilty, and those who face long term imprisonment.

Her father, [[Othman A. Abbott|Othman Abbott]], was a lawyer and Nebraska's first [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Nebraska|Lieutenant Governor]] (1877\u20131879).

However, her family could not afford to send her to college due to a drought which struck Nebraska and eventually led to an economic depression. Instead of going to college immediately, Abbott began to teach high school in Grand Island, [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Nebraska]].<ref name=\":0\"/> Determined to receive a college education, Abbott took correspondence courses and night classes until she was able to afford to fully enroll. Abbott enrolled at the [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln|University of Nebraska]], receiving her degree in 1901. She continued to teach for two more years and was eventually awarded a fellowship to the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edith-Abbott|title=Edith Abbott {{!}} American social worker|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=April 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref> While at the University of Chicago working on her doctorate, she met Professor [[Sophonisba Breckinridge]].

She learned from social reformers [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], who championed new approaches to dealing with poverty. The Webbs influenced the direction of Abbott's career. The Webbs were in favour of repealing the British \"poor laws\"\u2014which they viewed as demeaning to people in poverty\u2014and they supported establishing programs to eliminate poverty.<ref name=\"Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 1\">{{cite book|author1=Sicherman, Barbara|author2=Carol Hurd Green|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|year=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627338|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich_0/page/1 1]|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich_0/page/1}}</ref> While studying in London, Abbott lived part of the time in a social reformers' settlement in a poverty-stricken area of the East End, where she gained experience in social work.<ref name=\"Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 1\"/>\n\n== Early career ==\n\nAbbott returned to the United States in 1907 after her years studying in London, and took a job teaching economics at [[Wellesley College]]. Though her job at Wellesley was highly regarded for a woman with a Ph.D at the time, she desired to return to [[Chicago]].

Grace and Edith Abbott became great additions to the reform-minded community as they contributed significantly through their commitment to social reform advocacy and scholarship of statistical research.\n\nThe long-lasting professional partnership between Abbott and Breckinridge first started during their years together at the School of Civics and Philanthropy. They shared a common interest in detailed statistical investigations of contemporary social problems which they believed they could use to spark reform advocacy. As a result of her experience in statistical research, following a crime wave in Chicago in 1914 Abbott was commissioned to investigate statistics on crime and criminals in the city. This led to a ground-breaking report titled \"Statistics Relating to Crime in Chicago\", published in 1915.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sharonlohr.com/blog/2019/8/16/how-did-edith-abbott-come-to-write-about-crime-statistics-in-1915|title=How Did Edith Abbott Come to Write about Crime Statistics in 1915?

(A follow-up study, The Tenements of Chicago, 1908\u20131935, was published in 1936); The Delinquent Child and the Home (1912), a study of Chicago's juvenile court; and Truancy and Non-Attendance in the Chicago Schools (1917), an investigation which led them to support compulsory school attendance and child labour legislation. In 1927, in dedication to the \"scientific and professional interests of social work\", Abbott and Breckinridge jointly established the distinguished academic journal, ''[[Social Service Review]]'', published by the [[University of Chicago Press]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWith the joint efforts of Abbott and Breckinridge, in 1920, the [[University of Chicago]]'s Board of Trustees voted to rename the School the University of Chicago Graduate School of Social Service Administration. It was the first graduate school of social work in the country affiliated with a major research university.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American Urban History|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1\u20133|chapter=Abbott, Edith|last1=Gerard|first1=Gene C.|editor1-last=Goldfield|editor1-first=David R.}}</ref> Abbott was hired as an associate professor of social economy, and was named dean in 1924. She became the first US woman to become the dean of an American graduate school. Abbott, along with Breckinridge, transformed the field of social work by emphasizing the importance of formal education in social work and the need to include field experience as part of the training. They designed a curriculum that heavily emphasized social statistics as the historical, legal, economic and political root causes of social problems and public welfare efforts. In addition, they fought for the professional status of social work. In 1931, Abbott collected many of her papers, addresses and speeches on social service education and created a single volume entitled Social Welfare and Professional Education (1931, revised and enlarged in 1942).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAbbott focused her attention oner her students to portray the basic principles that can be transmitted to students. She states these principles must derive from \"a critical examination of the methods used to produce certain results and a searching equally for the causes of apparent failure and apparent success.\"<ref name=\"Wisner 1958 1\u201310\">{{Cite journal|last=Wisner|first=Elizabeth|date=1958|title=Edith Abbott's Contributions to Social Work Education|jstor=30016157|journal=Social Service Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1\u201310|doi=10.1086/640389}}</ref> Abbott derived a curriculum for students that desired a career in social work.<ref name=\"Wisner 1958 1\u201310\"/>\n\n== Later career ==\nAbbott was a prominent immigration expert, working for reforms that would end exploitation of immigrants. She was appointed chair of the Committee on Crime and the Foreign Born of the [[Wickersham Commission|Wickersham National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement]] (1929\u201331).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sicherman, Barbara|author2=Carol Hurd Green|title=Notable American Women: The Modern Period|year=1980|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674627338|pages=[https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich_0/page/2 2]|url=https://archive.org/details/notableamericanw00sich_0/page/2}}</ref>\n\nThrough her advocacy, Abbott wrote in scholarly articles, book reviews, and governmental reports in which she discussed issues such as women's and children's rights, crime, immigration, and public assistance. She also stressed the importance of a [[public welfare]] administration, the need for a more humane [[social welfare]] system, and the responsibility of the state in addressing social problems.\n\nMany of the contributions during Abbott's career were dedicated to addressing welfare reform and adopting more humane standards for welfare treatment. In 1926, Abbott helped establish the Cook County Bureau of Public Welfare. Abbott and Breckinridge founded the Social Service Review in 1927, which, still administered by the University of Chicago, \"is committed to examining social welfare policy and practice and evaluating its effects.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/a/abbott_e.htm|title=Edith Abbott|website=www.naswfoundation.org|access-date=April 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912015959/http://www.naswfoundation.org/pioneers/a/abbott_e.htm|archive-date=September 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Throughout the Great Depression Edith Abbott worked  alongside her sister to combat a wide array of social ills, from the mistreatment of immigrants to the abuses of child labor.

Abbott was known to be a confidante and special consultant to [[Harry Hopkins]], adviser to President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. In 1950, Abbott was known to have been appointed to a single case on the California Supreme Court, making her the first woman to sit on the state's supreme court.<ref name=\"Sicherman, Barbara, and Carol Hurd Green 1980 1\" />\n\nThe death of Edith's sister, Grace, in 1939 caused Edith to become quarrelsome and lonely, and slowly she began to withdraw herself from public life. In 1941, she published her final book, Public Assistance, and in 1942 she officially retired as the Dean of the School of Social Service Administration. Edith Abbott spent her remaining years living with her family in their home in Grand Island, Nebraska, where she died of [[pneumonia]] in 1957. She left the bulk of her estate to the Grand Island Public Library. She also left a trust for a collection of nonfiction books in memory of her mother, Elizabeth Abbott. At the time of Edith Abbott's death in 1957, Wayne McMillen of [[Social Service Review]] wrote, \"History will include her name among the handful of leaders who have made enduring contributions to the field of education. Social work has now taken its place as an established profession. She, more than any other one person, gave direction to the education required for that profession.

It then moved to Egypt where it joined the [[10th Indian Division]], by now designated as '''20th Indian Brigade'''.{{efn|name=ImperialService|The brigade is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ''20th Imperial Service Brigade'' due to the fact that it included three [[Imperial Service Troops]] battalions during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].

Kitchener identified the Indian Army's main task as the defence of the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] against foreign aggression (particularly Russian expansion into Afghanistan) with [[internal security]] relegated to a secondary role.

While in France, the brigade was known by its geographical rather than numerical designation so as to avoid confusion with the British [[20th Brigade (United Kingdom)|20th Brigade]] also serving on the Western Front at the same time.  The brigade served with the division as part of the [[Indian Corps]] on the Western Front until the end of 1915.<ref name=Perry89>{{harvnb|Perry|1993|p=89}}</ref>\n\nFor the rest of 1914, the brigade took part in the [[Defence of Festubert]] (23 \u2013 24 November) and the [[Winter operations 1914\u201315#Defence of Givenchy|Defence of Givenchy]] (20 \u2013 21 December).<ref name=Perry89/>  In the former, [[Naik (military rank)|Naik]] [[Darwan Singh Negi]] of the 1st Battalion, [[39th Garhwal Rifles]] won the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.
