{"title_page": "Contempt of Parliament", "text_new": "{{use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\nIn countries with a [[parliamentary system of government]], '''contempt of Parliament''' is the offence of obstructing the [[legislature]] in the carrying out of its functions, or of hindering any [[legislator]] in the performance of their duties. The concept is common in countries with a parliamentary system in the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]], or which are derived from or influenced by the Westminster model. The offence is known by various other names in jurisdictions in which the legislature is not called \"[[Parliament]]\", most notably '''[[contempt of Congress]]''' in the United States. Actions that may constitute contempt of Parliament include:\n* deliberately misleading a house of the legislature, or a legislative [[committee]];\n* refusing to [[testify]] before, or to produce documents to, a house or committee; and\n* attempting to influence a member of the legislature by bribery or threats.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a house of the legislature may declare any act to constitute contempt, and this is not subject to judicial review. In others, contempt of Parliament is defined by [[statute]]; while the legislature makes the initial decision of whether to punish for contempt, the person or organisation in contempt may appeal to the [[court]]s. Some jurisdictions consider contempt of Parliament to be a criminal offence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.claruspress.ie/shop/contempt-of-parliament/|title=Contempt of Parliament|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n\n===Commonwealth level===\nIn the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], the ''Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987'' defines contempt of Parliament as:\n\n{{quote|Conduct (including the use of words)... [which] amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.}}\n\nContempt decisions by the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] or the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] are subject to review by federal courts. This follows after the [[Browne\u2013Fitzpatrick privilege case, 1955|Browne\u2013Fitzpatrick privilege case]], in which Morgan, Fitzpatrick and Frank Browne were denied legal representation, subsequently convicted, and served 90 days each in jail for publishing an allegedly defamatory article against a member of Parliament.\n\nPunishments are limited under the Act to (for individuals) a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of $5,000 and/or six months' imprisonment, or (for corporations) a fine of $25,000.\n\nIn the Senate, allegations of contempt are heard by the Privileges Committee, which decides whether or not contempt was committed, and if so, what punishment is to be imposed. In practice, there have been very few times when a hearing determined that anyone was in contempt, and on no occasions has anyone been punished beyond a warning, with an apology and/or other appropriate remedial action.\n\n===State level===\n{{expand section|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Canada==\n\n===Federal level===\n{{See also|Censure#Canada|Parliamentary privilege#In Canada}}\n\nThe power to find a person in contempt of Parliament stemmed from Section 18 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' in which \"The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed&nbsp;... shall not confer any privileges, immunities, or powers exceeding those at the passing of such Act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the members thereof.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_17|title=Constitution Acts, 1867|website=Laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the above-mentioned \"privileges\" there is an important difference between the \"individual parliamentary privileges\" and \"collective parliamentary privileges\".

Privilege extends to the publication of papers and reports by order of the House, including the official record [[Hansard]]. Freedom from arrest originally prevented the arrest (on criminal as well as civil grounds) of members, their goods and their staff.  The freedom from arrest of servants and goods were removed in the 18th century as the privilege was open to abuse, as was immunity from arrest for criminal acts. MPs today are only protected from arrest on civil grounds, for contempt of court. Regulation of composition extends to determining who is elected and whether they may take their seat.

The concept is common in countries with a parliamentary system in the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]], or which are derived from or influenced by the Westminster model. The offence is known by various other names in jurisdictions in which the legislature is not called \"[[Parliament]]\", most notably '''[[contempt of Congress]]''' in the United States. Actions that may constitute contempt of Parliament include:\n* deliberately misleading a house of the legislature, or a legislative [[committee]];\n* refusing to [[testify]] before, or to produce documents to, a house or committee; and\n* attempting to influence a member of the legislature by bribery or threats.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a house of the legislature may declare any act to constitute contempt, and this is not subject to judicial review. In others, contempt of Parliament is defined by [[statute]]; while the legislature makes the initial decision of whether to punish for contempt, the person or organisation in contempt may appeal to the [[court]]s. Some jurisdictions consider contempt of Parliament to be a criminal offence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.claruspress.ie/shop/contempt-of-parliament/|title=Contempt of Parliament|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n\n===Commonwealth level===\nIn the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], the ''Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987'' defines contempt of Parliament as:\n\n{{quote|Conduct (including the use of words)... [which] amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.}}\n\nContempt decisions by the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] or the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] are subject to review by federal courts. This follows after the [[Browne\u2013Fitzpatrick privilege case, 1955|Browne\u2013Fitzpatrick privilege case]], in which Morgan, Fitzpatrick and Frank Browne were denied legal representation, subsequently convicted, and served 90 days each in jail for publishing an allegedly defamatory article against a member of Parliament.\n\nPunishments are limited under the Act to (for individuals) a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of $5,000 and/or six months' imprisonment, or (for corporations) a fine of $25,000.\n\nIn the Senate, allegations of contempt are heard by the Privileges Committee, which decides whether or not contempt was committed, and if so, what punishment is to be imposed. In practice, there have been very few times when a hearing determined that anyone was in contempt, and on no occasions has anyone been punished beyond a warning, with an apology and/or other appropriate remedial action.\n\n===State level===\n{{expand section|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Canada==\n\n===Federal level===\n{{See also|Censure#Canada|Parliamentary privilege#In Canada}}\n\nThe power to find a person in contempt of Parliament stemmed from Section 18 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' in which \"The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed&nbsp;... shall not confer any privileges, immunities, or powers exceeding those at the passing of such Act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the members thereof.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_17|title=Constitution Acts, 1867|website=Laws.justice.gc.ca|accessdate=3 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the above-mentioned \"privileges\" there is an important difference between the \"individual parliamentary privileges\" and \"collective parliamentary privileges\".

She appeared with stars such as [[Ben Turpin]]. Raised by what would now likely be known as a stage mom, Fabray herself was not much interested in show business until later on, and never believed in pushing children into performing at a young age, instead wishing for them to be able to live out their childhoods as opposed to having to deal with adult concerns at a young age.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her early dance training, however, did lead her always to consider herself a tap dancer first and foremost.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-19/entertainment/ca-389_1_nanette-fabray|title=Hoofer at Heart, Funny Lady on the Stage :  Performance: Comedic roles gravitate to actress-tap dancer Nanette Fabray.

During the [[Great Depression]], her mother turned their home into a boarding house, which Fabray and her siblings helped run, Nanette\u2019s main job being ironing clothes.<ref name=\":0\" /> In her early teenage years, Fabray attended the [[Max Reinhardt]] School of the Theatre on a scholarship. She then attended [[Hollywood High School]], participating in the drama program with a favorite teacher, where she graduated in 1939.<ref name=\":0\" /> She beat out classmate [[Alexis Smith]] for the lead in the school play her senior year. Fabray entered [[Los Angeles City College|Los Angeles Junior College]] in the fall of 1939, but did not do well and withdrew a few months later.<ref name=\":0\" /> She had always had difficulty in school due to an undiagnosed hearing impairment, which made learning difficult. She eventually was diagnosed with a [[Conductive hearing loss|conductive]] hearing loss (due to congenital, progressive [[otosclerosis]]) in her twenties after an acting teacher encouraged her to get her hearing tested. Fabray said of the experience, \"It was a revelation to me. All these years I had thought I was stupid, but in reality I just had a hearing problem.\" Fabray gave many interviews over the years and much of the information known about her was revealed in these conversations.

She next appeared in the stage production ''Meet the People'' in Los Angeles in 1940, which then toured the United States in 1940\u20131941. In the show, she sang the opera aria \"[[Caro nome]]\" from [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' while tap dancing. During the show's New York run, Fabray was invited to perform the \"Caro nome\" number for a benefit at [[Madison Square Garden]] with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as the main speaker. [[Ed Sullivan]] was the [[master of ceremonies]] for the event and the famed host, reading a cue card, mispronounced her name as \"Nanette Fa-bare-ass.\" After this embarrassing ''faux pas'', the actress immediately legally changed the spelling of her name from Fabares to as close as possible match the proper pronunciation: Fabray.<ref name=\"archive\">\"{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/nanette-fabray|title=Interview with Nanette Fabray|date=August 12, 2004|first=Jennifer|last=Howard|work=[[Archive of American Television]]|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]]|location=[[North Hollywood, Los Angeles]]|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> \n \n[[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]], conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic]], saw Fabray's performance in ''Meet the People'' and offered to sponsor operatic vocal training for her at the [[Juilliard School]].

Fabray suffered associated memory loss and visual issues such as [[nystagmus]], but still had to finish her scenes (namely a car chase) in the movie, for which filming had not yet wrapped.

She appeared with stars such as [[Ben Turpin]]. Raised by what would now likely be known as a stage mom, Fabray herself was not much interested in show business until later on, and never believed in pushing children into performing at a young age, instead wishing for them to be able to live out their childhoods as opposed to having to deal with adult concerns at a young age.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her early dance training, however, did lead her always to consider herself a tap dancer first and foremost.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-19/entertainment/ca-389_1_nanette-fabray|title=Hoofer at Heart, Funny Lady on the Stage :  Performance: Comedic roles gravitate to actress-tap dancer Nanette Fabray.

She eventually was diagnosed with a [[Conductive hearing loss|conductive]] hearing loss (due to congenital, progressive [[otosclerosis]]) in her twenties after an acting teacher encouraged her to get her hearing tested. Fabray said of the experience, \"It was a revelation to me.

In the show, she sang the opera aria \"[[Caro nome]]\" from [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' while tap dancing. During the show's New York run, Fabray was invited to perform the \"Caro nome\" number for a benefit at [[Madison Square Garden]] with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as the main speaker. [[Ed Sullivan]] was the [[master of ceremonies]] for the event and the famed host, reading a cue card, mispronounced her name as \"Nanette Fa-bare-ass.\" After this embarrassing ''faux pas'', the actress immediately legally changed the spelling of her name from Fabares to as close as possible match the proper pronunciation: Fabray.<ref name=\"archive\">\"{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/nanette-fabray|title=Interview with Nanette Fabray|date=August 12, 2004|first=Jennifer|last=Howard|work=[[Archive of American Television]]|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation]]|location=[[North Hollywood, Los Angeles]]|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> \n \n[[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]], conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic]], saw Fabray's performance in ''Meet the People'' and offered to sponsor operatic vocal training for her at the [[Juilliard School]].

Fabray suffered associated memory loss and visual issues such as [[nystagmus]], but still had to finish her scenes (namely a car chase) in the movie, for which filming had not yet wrapped.

The purpose of CM is to control a project's time / delivery, cost and quality\u2014sometimes referred to as a [[project management triangle]] or \"triple constraints.\"<ref>3rd Forum \"International Construction Project Management\" 26th/27 June 2003 in Berlin</ref> CM is compatible with all [[Project delivery method|project delivery systems]], including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings ([[Commercial property|commercial real estate]], [[Transport#Infrastructure|transportation infrastructure]], industrial facilities, and [[Infrastructure#Military|military infrastructure]]), called capital projects.\n\n==The role of a contractor==\nContractors are assigned to a [[construction]] project during the design or once the design has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer. This is done by going through a [[bidding]] process with different contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of three common selection methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based selection.\n\nA construction manager should have the ability to handle [[public safety]], [[time management]], [[cost management]], [[quality management]], [[decision making]], [[mathematics]], [[working drawings]], and [[human resources]].<ref name=\"textbook\"/>\n\n== Function ==\nThe functions of construction management typically include the following: \n#Specifying project objectives and plans including delineation of scope, budgeting, scheduling, setting performance requirements, and selecting project participants.\n#Maximizing the resource efficiency through [[procurement]] of labor, materials and equipment.\n#Implementing various operations through proper coordination and control of planning, design, estimating, contracting and construction in the entire process.\n#Developing effective [[Construction Communication|communications]] and mechanisms for resolving conflicts.<ref>{{Cite web | title=What Is Construction Project Management? | url=http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | author=Gerardo Viera | publisher=PM Hut | date=September 2008 | accessdate=2010-07-04 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420205521/http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | archivedate=2010-04-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Construction Management Association of America (CMAA)|Construction Management Association of America]] (CMAA) states the most common responsibilities of a Construction Manager fall into the following 7 categories: Project Management Planning, Cost Management, Time Management, Quality Management, Contract Administration, Safety Management, and CM Professional Practice. CM professional practice includes specific activities, such as defining the responsibilities and management structure of the project management team, organizing and leading by implementing project controls, defining roles and responsibilities, developing communication protocols, and identifying elements of project design and construction likely to give rise to disputes and claims.<ref name=\"CMAA\">{{cite web | title=CMAA | website=CMAA | url=http://cmaanet.org/ | language=af | accessdate=2015-07-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150724183335/http://cmaanet.org/ | archivedate=2015-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Seven types of construction==\n*'''Agricultural:''' Typically economical buildings, and other improvements, for agricultural purposes. Examples include barns, equipment and animal sheds, specialized fencing, storage [[silo]]s and [[elevator]]s, and water supply and drains such as wells, tanks, and ditches.\n*'''Residential:''' Residential construction includes houses, apartments, townhouses, and other smaller, low-rise housing, small office types.<ref name=textbook /> \n*'''Commercial:''' This refers to construction for the needs of private commerce, trade, and services. Examples include office buildings, \"big box\" stores, shopping centers and malls, warehouses, banks, theaters, casinos, resorts, golf courses, and larger residential structures such as high-rise hotels and condominiums.\n*'''Institutional:''' This category is for the needs of government and other public organizations. Examples include schools, fire and police stations, libraries, museums, dormitories, research buildings, hospitals, transportation terminals, some military facilities, and governmental buildings.\n*'''Industrial:''' Buildings and other constructed items used for storage and product production, including chemical and power plants, steel mills, oil refineries and platforms, manufacturing plants, pipelines, and seaports.\n*'''Heavy civil:''' The construction of transportation [[infrastructure]] such as roads, bridges, railroads, tunnels, airports, and fortified military facilities.<ref name=textbook /> Dams are also included, but most other water-related infrastructure is considered environmental.\n*'''Environmental:''' Environmental construction was part of heavy civil, but is now separate, dealing with projects that improve the environment. Some examples are water and wastewater treatment plants, sanitary and storm sewers, solid waste management, and air pollution control.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Obtaining the project==\n\n===Bids===\nA bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to complete their construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they should expect to pay the construction management company in order for them to complete the project.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Open bid''': An open bid is used for public projects. Any and all contractors are allowed to submit their bid due to public advertising.\n*'''Closed bid''': A closed bid is used for private projects. A selection of contractors are sent an invitation for bid so only they can submit a bid for the specified project.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Selection methods===\n*'''Low-bid selection''': This selection focuses on the price of a project. Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that is the lowest amount they are willing to do the job for. Then the owner usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete the job for them.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Best-value selection''': This selection focuses on both the price and qualifications of the contractors submitting bids. This means that the owner chooses the contractor with the best price and the best qualifications. The owner decides by using a request for proposal (RFP), which provides the owner with the contractor's exact form of scheduling and budgeting that the contractor expects to use for the project.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Qualifications-based selection''': This selection is used when the owner decides to choose the contractor only on the basis of their qualifications. The owner then uses a request for qualifications (RFQ), which provides the owner with the contractor's experience, management plans, project organization, and budget and schedule performance. The owner may also ask for safety records and individual credentials of their members.<ref name=textbook>{{cite book|title=Construction Management Jumpstart|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|author=Barbara J. Jackson|edition=2nd}}</ref> This method is most often used when the contractor is hired early during the design process so that the contractor can provide input and cost estimates as the design develops.\n\n===Payment contracts===\n*'''Lump sum''': This is the most common type of contract. The construction manager and the owner agree on the overall cost of the construction project and the owner is responsible for paying that amount whether the construction project exceeds or falls below the agreed price of payment.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Cost plus fee''': This contract provides payment for the contractor including the total cost of the project as well as a fixed fee or percentage of the total cost. This contract is beneficial to the contractor since any additional costs will be paid for, even though they were unexpected for the owner.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Guaranteed maximum price''': This contract is the same as the cost-plus-fee contract although there is a set price that the overall cost and fee do not go above.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Unitprice''': This contract is used when the cost cannot be determined ahead of time. The owner provides materials with a specific unit price to limit spending.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Project stages==\n[[File:Buildings-05-00209-g001.png|thumb|right|Characteristics of construction project stages of various project management approaches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>]]\nThe stages of a typical construction project have been defined as '''feasibility''', '''design''', '''construction''' and '''operation''',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Antunes |first1=Ricardo |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Vicente |title=A Production Model for Construction:  A Theoretical Framework |journal=Buildings |date=3 March 2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013228 |doi=10.3390/buildings5010209|doi-access=free }}</ref> each stage relating to the project life cycle.\n\n===Feasibility and design===\nFeasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility, schematic design, design development, and contract documents. It is the responsibility of the design team to ensure that the design meets all building codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding process takes place.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Conceptual/Programming and feasibility:''' The needs, goals, and objectives must be determined for the building. Decisions must be made on the building size, number of rooms, how the space will be used, and who will be using the space. This must all be considered to begin the actual designing of the building. This phase is normally a written list of each room or space, the critical information about those spaces, and the approximate square footage of each area.\n*'''Schematic design:''' Schematic designs are sketches used to identify spaces, shapes, and patterns. Materials, sizes, colors, and textures must be considered in the sketches.<ref name=textbook /> This phase usually involves developing the floor plan, elevations, a site plan, and possibly a few details.\n*'''Design development (DD):''' This step requires research and investigation into what materials and equipment will be used as well as their cost. During this phase, the drawings are refined with information from structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineers. It also involves a more rigorous evaluation how the applicable building codes will impact the project.\n*'''Contract documents (CDs):''' Contract documents are the final drawings and specifications of the construction project. They are used by contractors to determine their bid while builders use them for the construction process. Contract documents can also be called working drawings.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Pre-construction===\nThe pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to the contractor that they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to proceed is when the owner gives permission to the contractor to begin their work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team which includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendent]], and field engineer.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Project manager''': The project manager is in charge of the project team.\n*'''Contract administrator''': The contract administrator assists the project manager as well as the superintendent with the details of the construction contract.\n*'''Superintendent''': It is the superintendent's job to make sure everything is on schedule including flow of materials, deliveries, and equipment. They are also in charge of coordinating on-site construction activities.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Field engineer''': A field engineer is considered an entry-level position and is responsible for paperwork.\nDuring the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site investigation takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on the job site. This is in order to get the site ready before the actual construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions such as historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to determine if the soil is in good condition to be built upon.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Procurement===\nThe procurement stage is when labor, materials and equipment needed to complete the project are purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the company does all their own construction work. If the contractor does not do their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors. Subcontractors are contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work such as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the same way a general contractor would be, which is through the bidding process. Purchase orders are also part of the procurement stage.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Purchase orders:''' A purchase order is used in various types of businesses. In this case, a purchase order is an agreement between a buyer and seller that the products purchased meet the required specifications for the agreed price.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Construction===\nThe construction stage begins with a pre-construction meeting brought together by the superintendent (on an American project). The pre-construction meeting is meant to make decisions dealing with work hours, material storage, quality control, and site access. The next step is to move everything onto the construction site and set it all up.<ref name=textbook />\n\nA '''Contractor progress payment schedule''' is a schedule of when (according to project milestones or specified dates) contractors and suppliers will be paid for the current progress of installed work.\n\n'''Progress payments''' are partial payments for work completed during a portion, usually a month, during a construction period. Progress payments are made to general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects progress. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis but could be modified to meet certain milestones. Progress payments are an important part of contract administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete the project.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Minks|first=William|title=Construction Jobsite Management|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Owner occupancy===\nOnce the owner moves into the building, a warranty period begins. This is to ensure that all materials, equipment, and quality meet the expectations of the owner that are included within the contract.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Issues resulting from construction==\n\n===Dust and mud===\nWhen construction vehicles are driving around a site or moving earth, a lot of dust is created, especially during the dryer months. This may cause disruption for surrounding businesses or homes. A popular method of dust control is to have a water truck driving through the site spraying water on the dry dirt to minimize the movement of dust within and out of the construction site. When water is introduced mud is created. This mud sticks to the tires of the construction vehicles and is often lead out to the surrounding roads.  A street sweeper may clean the roads to reduce dirty road conditions.\n\n===Environmental protections===\n*'''Storm [[water pollution]]:''' As a result of construction, the soil is displaced from its original location which can possibly cause environmental problems in the future. Runoff can occur during storms which can possibly transfer harmful pollutants through the soil to rivers, lakes, wetlands, and coastal waters. \n*'''Endangered species:''' If [[endangered]] species have been found on the construction site, the site must be shut down for some time. The construction site must be shut down for as long as it takes for authorities to make a decision on the situation. Once the situation has been assessed, the contractor makes the appropriate accommodations to not disturb the species.\n*'''Vegetation:''' There may often be particular trees or other vegetation that must be protected on the job site. This may require fences or security tape to warn builders that they must not be harmed.\n*'''Wetlands:''' The contractor must make accommodations so that erosion and water flow are not affected by construction. Any liquid spills must be maintained due to contaminants that may enter the wetland.\n*'''Historical or [[cultural artifacts]]:''' Artifacts may include arrowheads, pottery shards, and bones. All work comes to a halt if any artifacts are found and will not resume until they can be properly examined and removed from the area.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Construction activity documentation==\nProject meetings take place at scheduled intervals to discuss the progress on the construction site and any concerns or issues. The discussion and any decisions made at the meeting must be documented.<ref name=textbook />\n\nDiaries, logs, and daily field reports keep track of the daily activities on a job site each day.\n*'''Diaries:''' Each member of the project team is expected to keep a project [[diary]]. The diary contains summaries of the day's events in the member's own words. They are used to keep track of any daily work activity, conversations, observations, or any other relevant information regarding the construction activities. Diaries can be referred to when disputes arise and a diary happens to contain information connected with the disagreement. Diaries that are handwritten can be used as evidence in court.\n*'''Logs:''' Logs keep track of the regular activities on the job site such as phone logs, transmittal logs, delivery logs, and RFI (Request for Information) logs.\n*'''Daily field reports:''' Daily field reports are a more formal way of recording information on the job site. They contain information that includes the day's activities, temperature and weather conditions, delivered equipment or materials, visitors on the site, and equipment used that day.<ref name=textbook />\n\nLabor statements are required on a daily basis. Also list of Labor, PERT CPM are needed for labor planning to complete a project in time.\n\n==Resolving disputes==\n*'''Mediation:''' [[Mediation]] uses a third party mediator to resolve any disputes. The mediator helps both disputing parties to come to a mutual agreement. This process ensures that no attorneys become involved in the dispute and is less time-consuming.\n*'''Minitrial:''' A minitrial takes more time and money than a mediation. The minitrial takes place in an informal setting and involves some type of advisor or attorney that must be paid. The disputing parties may come to an agreement or the third party advisor may offer their advice. The agreement is nonbinding and can be broken. \n*'''Arbitration:''' [[Arbitration]] is the most costly and time-consuming way to resolve a dispute. Each party is represented by an attorney while witnesses and evidence are presented. Once all information is provided on the issue, the arbitrator makes a ruling which provides the final decision. The arbitrator provides the final decision on what must be done and it is a binding agreement between each of the disputing parties.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Study and practice==\nConstruction Management education comes in a variety of formats: formal degree programs (Two-year [[associate degree]]; four-year [[baccalaureate degree]], [[masters degree]], [[project management]], [[operations management]] [[engineer degree]], [[doctor of philosophy]] degree, [[postdoctoral researcher]]); on-the-job-training; and continuing education and professional development. Information on degree programs is available from [[ABET]], the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE), the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) or the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC).\n \nAccording to the American Council for Construction Education (one of the academic accreditation agencies responsible for accrediting construction management programs in the U.S.), the academic field of construction management encompasses a wide range of topics. These range from general management skills, through management skills specifically related to construction, to technical knowledge of construction methods and practices. There are many schools offering Construction Management programs, including some offering a master's degree.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922010056/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php |date=2007-09-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326180259/http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-26|title=Standards and criteria for accreditation of post-secondary construction education degree programs|publisher=American Council for Construction Management|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\n\nCapital project management software (CPMS) refers to the systems that are currently available that help capital project owner/operators, program managers, and construction managers, control and manage the vast amount of information that capital construction projects create. A collection, or portfolio of projects only makes this a bigger challenge. These systems go by different names: capital project management software, computer construction software, construction management software, project management information systems. Usually Construction Management can be referred as subset of CPMS where the scope of CPMS is not limited to construction phases of project. Among main construction management software can be mentioned [[Procore]] and [[PlanGrid]].\n\n==Required knowledge==\n*Construction and building\n*[[Technology]]\n*Public safety\n*[[Customer service]]\n*[[Human resources]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*Leadership\n\n==Business model==\n[[File:Panam\u00e1 Construction.JPG|thumb|alt=Two tall buildings, with construction cranes on top, next to much taller skyscraper|[[Skyscraper]]s under construction in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]]]\nThe construction industry typically includes three parties: an owner, a licensed designer ([[architect]] or [[engineer]]) and a builder (usually known as a [[general contractor]]). There are traditionally two contracts between these parties as they work together to plan, design and construct the project.<ref>Halpin, Daniel. Construction Management. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006</ref> The first contract is the owner-designer contract, which involves planning, design, and construction contract administration. The second contract is the owner-contractor contract, which involves construction. An indirect third-party relationship exists between the designer and the contractor, due to these two contracts.\n\nAn owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an adviser, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer, design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as necessary.\n\n===Design, bid, build contracts===\n{{Main|Design\u2013bid\u2013build}}\nThe phrase \"design, bid, build\" describes the prevailing model of construction management, in which the general contractor is engaged through a tender process after designs have been completed by the architect or engineer.\n\n==={{anchor|Design and build contracts}}Design-build contracts===\n{{Main|Design\u2013build}}\nMany owners \u2013 particularly government agencies \u2013 let out contracts known as ''design-build contracts''. In this type of contract, the construction team (known as the design-builder) is responsible for taking the owner's concept and completing a detailed design before (following the owner's approval of the design) proceeding with construction. [[Virtual design and construction]] technology may be used by contractors to maintain a tight construction time.\n\nThere are three main advantages to a design-build contract. First, the construction team is motivated to work with the architect to develop a practical design. The team can find creative ways to reduce construction costs without reducing the function of the final product. The second major advantage involves the schedule. Many projects are commissioned within a tight time frame. Under a traditional contract, construction cannot begin until after the design is finished and the project has been awarded to a bidder. In a design-build contract the contractor is established at the outset, and construction activities can proceed concurrently with the design. The third major advantage is that the design-build contractor has an incentive to keep the combined design and construction costs within the owner's budget. If speed is important, design and construction contracts can be awarded separately; bidding takes place on preliminary plans in a not-to-exceed contract instead of a single firm design-build contract.\n\nThe major problem<ref name=designbuild>{{cite web|last=Stagner|first=Steve|title=Design-Build and Alternative Project Delivery in Texas|url=http://www.cectexas.org/research_&_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|publisher=Texas Council of Engineering Companies|accessdate=18 October 2011|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912011002/http://www.cectexas.org/research_%26_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2011}}</ref> with design-build contracts is an inherent conflict of interest. In a standard contract the architect works for the owner and is directly responsible to the owner. In design-build the architect works for the design-builder, not the owner, therefore the design-builder may make design and construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit the owner. During construction, the architect normally acts as the owner's representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for the owner directly. Thus, the owner may get a building that is over-designed to increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-quality products to maximize profits.\n\n===Planning and scheduling===\nProject-management methodology is as follows:\n*Work breakdown structure\n*Project network of activities\n**[[Critical path method]] (CPM)\n**Resource management\n**Resource leveling\n**Risk assessment\n\n==={{anchor|Architecture\u2013Engineer}}Architecture\u2013engineer===\n*Work inspection\n*Change orders\n*Review payments\n*Materials and samples\n*Shop drawings\n*Three-dimensional image\n\n===Agency CM===\nConstruction cost management is a fee-based service in which the construction manager (CM) is responsible exclusively to the owner, acting in the owner's interests at every stage of the project. The construction manager offers impartial advice on matters such as:\n*Optimum use of available funds\n*Control of the scope of the work\n*Project scheduling\n*Optimum use of design and construction firms' skills and talents\n*Avoidance of delays, changes and disputes\n*Enhancing project design and construction quality\n*Optimum flexibility in contracting and procurement\n*Cash-flow management\n\nComprehensive management of every stage of the project, beginning with the original concept and project definition, yields the greatest benefit to owners. As time progresses beyond the pre-design phase, the CM's ability to effect cost savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing [[scope creep]]), helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering, cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application field of [[construction collaboration technology]] has been developed to apply information technology to construction management.\n\n===CM at-risk===\nCM at-risk is a delivery method which entails a commitment by the construction manager to deliver the project within a [[Guaranteed Maximum Price]] (GMP). The construction manager acts as a consultant to the owner in the development and design phases (preconstruction services), and as a general contractor during construction. When a construction manager is bound to a GMP, the fundamental character of the relationship is changed. In addition to acting in the owner's interest, the construction manager must control construction costs to stay within the GMP.\n\nCM at-risk is a global term referring to the business relationship of a construction contractor, owner and architect (or designer). Typically, a CM at-risk arrangement eliminates a \"low-bid\" construction project. A GMP agreement is a typical part of the CM-and-owner agreement (comparable to a \"low-bid\" contract), but with adjustments in responsibility for the CM. The advantage of a CM at-risk arrangement is budget management. Before a project's design is completed (six to eighteen months of coordination between designer and owner), the CM is involved with estimating the cost of constructing a project based on the goals of the designer and owner (design concept) and the project's scope. In balancing the costs, schedule, quality and scope of the project, the design may be modified instead of redesigned; if the owner decides to expand the project, adjustments can be made before pricing. To manage the budget before design is complete and construction crews mobilized, the CM conducts site management and purchases major items to efficiently manage time and cost.<ref name=\"The Risk in CM At-Risk\">{{cite journal |last=Strang |first=Warner |date=2002 |title=The Risk In CM \"At-Risk\" |url=https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |format=PDF |journal=CM eJournal |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=3\u20138 |access-date=July 22, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084545/https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Advantages====\n*CM is working \"at risk\", therefore have incentive to act in the owner's interest, as well as to efficiently manage construction costs, considering they would be liable for any amount in excess of the GMP\n*Ability to handle changes in design or scope<ref name=\"Sierra Companies 2013\">{{cite web | title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Construction Delivery Methods | website=Sierra Companies | date=2013-01-14 | url=http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | accessdate=2015-07-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235725/http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | archivedate=2015-07-22 }}</ref>\n\n====Drawbacks====\n*If a cost overrun occurred, it could cost the CM a great deal of money\n* The CM is allowed some mistake-related contingency, therefore there is a possibility that they will compensate by reducing the scope of the work to fit the GMP\n* Since the GMP is settled before design begins, it is difficult for owners to know whether they received the best possible bid<ref name=\"The Risk in CM At-Risk\"/>\n\n====Bottom line====\nAn at-risk delivery method is best for large projects\u2014both complete construction and renovation\u2014that are not easy to define, have a possibility of changing in scope, or have strict schedule deadlines.

The purpose of CM is to control a project's time / delivery, cost and quality\u2014sometimes referred to as a [[project management triangle]] or \"triple constraints.\"<ref>3rd Forum \"International Construction Project Management\" 26th/27 June 2003 in Berlin</ref> CM is compatible with all [[Project delivery method|project delivery systems]], including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings ([[Commercial property|commercial real estate]], [[Transport#Infrastructure|transportation infrastructure]], industrial facilities, and [[Infrastructure#Military|military infrastructure]]), called capital projects.\n\n==The role of a contractor==\nContractors are assigned to a [[construction]] project during the design or once the design has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer. This is done by going through a [[bidding]] process with different contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of three common selection methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based selection.\n\nA construction manager should have the ability to handle [[public safety]], [[time management]], [[cost management]], [[quality management]], [[decision making]], [[mathematics]], [[working drawings]], and [[human resources]].<ref name=\"textbook\"/>\n\n== Function ==\nThe functions of construction management typically include the following: \n#Specifying project objectives and plans including delineation of scope, budgeting, scheduling, setting performance requirements, and selecting project participants.\n#Maximizing the resource efficiency through [[procurement]] of labor, materials and equipment.\n#Implementing various operations through proper coordination and control of planning, design, estimating, contracting and construction in the entire process.\n#Developing effective [[Construction Communication|communications]] and mechanisms for resolving conflicts.<ref>{{Cite web | title=What Is Construction Project Management? | url=http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | author=Gerardo Viera | publisher=PM Hut | date=September 2008 | accessdate=2010-07-04 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420205521/http://www.pmhut.com/what-is-construction-project-management | archivedate=2010-04-20 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Construction Management Association of America (CMAA)|Construction Management Association of America]] (CMAA) states the most common responsibilities of a Construction Manager fall into the following 7 categories: Project Management Planning, Cost Management, Time Management, Quality Management, Contract Administration, Safety Management, and CM Professional Practice.

Examples include barns, equipment and animal sheds, specialized fencing, storage [[silo]]s and [[elevator]]s, and water supply and drains such as wells, tanks, and ditches.\n*'''Residential:''' Residential construction includes houses, apartments, townhouses, and other smaller, low-rise housing, small office types.<ref name=textbook /> \n*'''Commercial:''' This refers to construction for the needs of private commerce, trade, and services. Examples include office buildings, \"big box\" stores, shopping centers and malls, warehouses, banks, theaters, casinos, resorts, golf courses, and larger residential structures such as high-rise hotels and condominiums.\n*'''Institutional:''' This category is for the needs of government and other public organizations. Examples include schools, fire and police stations, libraries, museums, dormitories, research buildings, hospitals, transportation terminals, some military facilities, and governmental buildings.\n*'''Industrial:''' Buildings and other constructed items used for storage and product production, including chemical and power plants, steel mills, oil refineries and platforms, manufacturing plants, pipelines, and seaports.\n*'''Heavy civil:''' The construction of transportation [[infrastructure]] such as roads, bridges, railroads, tunnels, airports, and fortified military facilities.<ref name=textbook /> Dams are also included, but most other water-related infrastructure is considered environmental.\n*'''Environmental:''' Environmental construction was part of heavy civil, but is now separate, dealing with projects that improve the environment. Some examples are water and wastewater treatment plants, sanitary and storm sewers, solid waste management, and air pollution control.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Obtaining the project==\n\n===Bids===\nA bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to complete their construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they should expect to pay the construction management company in order for them to complete the project.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Open bid''': An open bid is used for public projects. Any and all contractors are allowed to submit their bid due to public advertising.\n*'''Closed bid''': A closed bid is used for private projects. A selection of contractors are sent an invitation for bid so only they can submit a bid for the specified project.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Selection methods===\n*'''Low-bid selection''': This selection focuses on the price of a project. Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that is the lowest amount they are willing to do the job for. Then the owner usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete the job for them.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Best-value selection''': This selection focuses on both the price and qualifications of the contractors submitting bids. This means that the owner chooses the contractor with the best price and the best qualifications. The owner decides by using a request for proposal (RFP), which provides the owner with the contractor's exact form of scheduling and budgeting that the contractor expects to use for the project.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Qualifications-based selection''': This selection is used when the owner decides to choose the contractor only on the basis of their qualifications. The owner then uses a request for qualifications (RFQ), which provides the owner with the contractor's experience, management plans, project organization, and budget and schedule performance. The owner may also ask for safety records and individual credentials of their members.<ref name=textbook>{{cite book|title=Construction Management Jumpstart|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|author=Barbara J. Jackson|edition=2nd}}</ref> This method is most often used when the contractor is hired early during the design process so that the contractor can provide input and cost estimates as the design develops.\n\n===Payment contracts===\n*'''Lump sum''': This is the most common type of contract. The construction manager and the owner agree on the overall cost of the construction project and the owner is responsible for paying that amount whether the construction project exceeds or falls below the agreed price of payment.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Cost plus fee''': This contract provides payment for the contractor including the total cost of the project as well as a fixed fee or percentage of the total cost. This contract is beneficial to the contractor since any additional costs will be paid for, even though they were unexpected for the owner.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Guaranteed maximum price''': This contract is the same as the cost-plus-fee contract although there is a set price that the overall cost and fee do not go above.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Unitprice''': This contract is used when the cost cannot be determined ahead of time. The owner provides materials with a specific unit price to limit spending.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Project stages==\n[[File:Buildings-05-00209-g001.png|thumb|right|Characteristics of construction project stages of various project management approaches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>]]\nThe stages of a typical construction project have been defined as '''feasibility''', '''design''', '''construction''' and '''operation''',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Antunes |first1=Ricardo |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Vicente |title=A Production Model for Construction:  A Theoretical Framework |journal=Buildings |date=3 March 2015 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=209\u2013228 |doi=10.3390/buildings5010209|doi-access=free }}</ref> each stage relating to the project life cycle.\n===Feasibility and design===\nFeasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility, schematic design, design development, and contract documents. It is the responsibility of the design team to ensure that the design meets all building codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding process takes place.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Conceptual/Programming and feasibility:''' The needs, goals, and objectives must be determined for the building. Decisions must be made on the building size, number of rooms, how the space will be used, and who will be using the space. This must all be considered to begin the actual designing of the building. This phase is normally a written list of each room or space, the critical information about those spaces, and the approximate square footage of each area.\n*'''Schematic design:''' Schematic designs are sketches used to identify spaces, shapes, and patterns. Materials, sizes, colors, and textures must be considered in the sketches.<ref name=textbook /> This phase usually involves developing the floor plan, elevations, a site plan, and possibly a few details.\n*'''Design development (DD):''' This step requires research and investigation into what materials and equipment will be used as well as their cost. During this phase, the drawings are refined with information from structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineers. It also involves a more rigorous evaluation how the applicable building codes will impact the project.\n*'''Contract documents (CDs):''' Contract documents are the final drawings and specifications of the construction project. They are used by contractors to determine their bid while builders use them for the construction process. Contract documents can also be called working drawings.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Pre-construction===\nThe pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to the contractor that they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to proceed is when the owner gives permission to the contractor to begin their work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team which includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendent]], and field engineer.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Project manager''': The project manager is in charge of the project team.\n*'''Contract administrator''': The contract administrator assists the project manager as well as the superintendent with the details of the construction contract.\n*'''Superintendent''': It is the superintendent's job to make sure everything is on schedule including flow of materials, deliveries, and equipment. They are also in charge of coordinating on-site construction activities.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Field engineer''': A field engineer is considered an entry-level position and is responsible for paperwork.\nDuring the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site investigation takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on the job site. This is in order to get the site ready before the actual construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions such as historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to determine if the soil is in good condition to be built upon.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Procurement===\nThe procurement stage is when labor, materials and equipment needed to complete the project are purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the company does all their own construction work. If the contractor does not do their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors. Subcontractors are contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work such as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the same way a general contractor would be, which is through the bidding process. Purchase orders are also part of the procurement stage.<ref name=textbook />\n*'''Purchase orders:''' A purchase order is used in various types of businesses. In this case, a purchase order is an agreement between a buyer and seller that the products purchased meet the required specifications for the agreed price.<ref name=textbook />\n\n===Construction===\nThe construction stage begins with a pre-construction meeting brought together by the superintendent (on an American project). The pre-construction meeting is meant to make decisions dealing with work hours, material storage, quality control, and site access. The next step is to move everything onto the construction site and set it all up.<ref name=textbook />\n\nA '''Contractor progress payment schedule''' is a schedule of when (according to project milestones or specified dates) contractors and suppliers will be paid for the current progress of installed work.\n\n'''Progress payments''' are partial payments for work completed during a portion, usually a month, during a construction period. Progress payments are made to general contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers as construction projects progress. Payments are typically made on a monthly basis but could be modified to meet certain milestones. Progress payments are an important part of contract administration for the contractor. Proper preparation of the information necessary for payment processing can help the contractor financially complete the project.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Minks|first=William|title=Construction Jobsite Management|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Owner occupancy===\nOnce the owner moves into the building, a warranty period begins. This is to ensure that all materials, equipment, and quality meet the expectations of the owner that are included within the contract.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Issues resulting from construction==\n\n===Dust and mud===\nWhen construction vehicles are driving around a site or moving earth, a lot of dust is created, especially during the dryer months. This may cause disruption for surrounding businesses or homes. A popular method of dust control is to have a water truck driving through the site spraying water on the dry dirt to minimize the movement of dust within and out of the construction site. When water is introduced mud is created. This mud sticks to the tires of the construction vehicles and is often lead out to the surrounding roads.  A street sweeper may clean the roads to reduce dirty road conditions.\n\n===Environmental protections===\n*'''Storm [[water pollution]]:''' As a result of construction, the soil is displaced from its original location which can possibly cause environmental problems in the future. Runoff can occur during storms which can possibly transfer harmful pollutants through the soil to rivers, lakes, wetlands, and coastal waters. \n*'''Endangered species:''' If [[endangered]] species have been found on the construction site, the site must be shut down for some time. The construction site must be shut down for as long as it takes for authorities to make a decision on the situation. Once the situation has been assessed, the contractor makes the appropriate accommodations to not disturb the species.\n*'''Vegetation:''' There may often be particular trees or other vegetation that must be protected on the job site. This may require fences or security tape to warn builders that they must not be harmed.\n*'''Wetlands:''' The contractor must make accommodations so that erosion and water flow are not affected by construction. Any liquid spills must be maintained due to contaminants that may enter the wetland.\n*'''Historical or [[cultural artifacts]]:''' Artifacts may include arrowheads, pottery shards, and bones. All work comes to a halt if any artifacts are found and will not resume until they can be properly examined and removed from the area.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Construction activity documentation==\nProject meetings take place at scheduled intervals to discuss the progress on the construction site and any concerns or issues. The discussion and any decisions made at the meeting must be documented.<ref name=textbook />\n\nDiaries, logs, and daily field reports keep track of the daily activities on a job site each day.\n*'''Diaries:''' Each member of the project team is expected to keep a project [[diary]]. The diary contains summaries of the day's events in the member's own words. They are used to keep track of any daily work activity, conversations, observations, or any other relevant information regarding the construction activities. Diaries can be referred to when disputes arise and a diary happens to contain information connected with the disagreement. Diaries that are handwritten can be used as evidence in court.\n*'''Logs:''' Logs keep track of the regular activities on the job site such as phone logs, transmittal logs, delivery logs, and RFI (Request for Information) logs.\n*'''Daily field reports:''' Daily field reports are a more formal way of recording information on the job site. They contain information that includes the day's activities, temperature and weather conditions, delivered equipment or materials, visitors on the site, and equipment used that day.<ref name=textbook />\n\nLabor statements are required on a daily basis. Also list of Labor, PERT CPM are needed for labor planning to complete a project in time.\n\n==Resolving disputes==\n*'''Mediation:''' [[Mediation]] uses a third party mediator to resolve any disputes. The mediator helps both disputing parties to come to a mutual agreement. This process ensures that no attorneys become involved in the dispute and is less time-consuming.\n*'''Minitrial:''' A minitrial takes more time and money than a mediation. The minitrial takes place in an informal setting and involves some type of advisor or attorney that must be paid. The disputing parties may come to an agreement or the third party advisor may offer their advice. The agreement is nonbinding and can be broken. \n*'''Arbitration:''' [[Arbitration]] is the most costly and time-consuming way to resolve a dispute. Each party is represented by an attorney while witnesses and evidence are presented. Once all information is provided on the issue, the arbitrator makes a ruling which provides the final decision. The arbitrator provides the final decision on what must be done and it is a binding agreement between each of the disputing parties.<ref name=textbook />\n\n==Study and practice==\nConstruction Management education comes in a variety of formats: formal degree programs (Two-year [[associate degree]]; four-year [[baccalaureate degree]], [[masters degree]], [[project management]], [[operations management]] [[engineer degree]], [[doctor of philosophy]] degree, [[postdoctoral researcher]]); on-the-job-training; and continuing education and professional development. Information on degree programs is available from [[ABET]], the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE), the Construction Management Association of America (CMAA) or the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC).\n \nAccording to the American Council for Construction Education (one of the academic accreditation agencies responsible for accrediting construction management programs in the U.S.), the academic field of construction management encompasses a wide range of topics. These range from general management skills, through management skills specifically related to construction, to technical knowledge of construction methods and practices. There are many schools offering Construction Management programs, including some offering a master's degree.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922010056/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/tools/search.php |date=2007-09-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326180259/http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-26|title=Standards and criteria for accreditation of post-secondary construction education degree programs|publisher=American Council for Construction Management|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\n\nCapital project management software (CPMS) refers to the systems that are currently available that help capital project owner/operators, program managers, and construction managers, control and manage the vast amount of information that capital construction projects create. A collection, or portfolio of projects only makes this a bigger challenge. These systems go by different names: capital project management software, computer construction software, construction management software, project management information systems. Usually Construction Management can be referred as subset of CPMS where the scope of CPMS is not limited to construction phases of project. Among main construction management software can be mentioned [[Procore]] and [[PlanGrid]].\n\n==Required knowledge==\n*Construction and building\n*[[Technology]]\n*Public safety\n*[[Customer service]]\n*[[Human resources]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*Leadership\n\n==Business model==\n[[File:Panam\u00e1 Construction.JPG|thumb|alt=Two tall buildings, with construction cranes on top, next to much taller skyscraper|[[Skyscraper]]s under construction in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]]]\nThe construction industry typically includes three parties: an owner, a licensed designer ([[architect]] or [[engineer]]) and a builder (usually known as a [[general contractor]]). There are traditionally two contracts between these parties as they work together to plan, design and construct the project.<ref>Halpin, Daniel. Construction Management. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006</ref> The first contract is the owner-designer contract, which involves planning, design, and construction contract administration. The second contract is the owner-contractor contract, which involves construction. An indirect third-party relationship exists between the designer and the contractor, due to these two contracts.\n\nAn owner may also contract with a construction project management company as an adviser, creating a third contract relationship in the project. The construction manager's role is to provide construction advice to the designer, design advice to the constructor on the owner's behalf and other advice as necessary.\n\n===Design, bid, build contracts===\n{{Main|Design\u2013bid\u2013build}}\nThe phrase \"design, bid, build\" describes the prevailing model of construction management, in which the general contractor is engaged through a tender process after designs have been completed by the architect or engineer.\n\n==={{anchor|Design and build contracts}}Design-build contracts===\n{{Main|Design\u2013build}}\nMany owners \u2013 particularly government agencies \u2013 let out contracts known as ''design-build contracts''. In this type of contract, the construction team (known as the design-builder) is responsible for taking the owner's concept and completing a detailed design before (following the owner's approval of the design) proceeding with construction. [[Virtual design and construction]] technology may be used by contractors to maintain a tight construction time.\n\nThere are three main advantages to a design-build contract. First, the construction team is motivated to work with the architect to develop a practical design. The team can find creative ways to reduce construction costs without reducing the function of the final product. The second major advantage involves the schedule. Many projects are commissioned within a tight time frame. Under a traditional contract, construction cannot begin until after the design is finished and the project has been awarded to a bidder. In a design-build contract the contractor is established at the outset, and construction activities can proceed concurrently with the design. The third major advantage is that the design-build contractor has an incentive to keep the combined design and construction costs within the owner's budget. If speed is important, design and construction contracts can be awarded separately; bidding takes place on preliminary plans in a not-to-exceed contract instead of a single firm design-build contract.\n\nThe major problem<ref name=designbuild>{{cite web|last=Stagner|first=Steve|title=Design-Build and Alternative Project Delivery in Texas|url=http://www.cectexas.org/research_&_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|publisher=Texas Council of Engineering Companies|accessdate=18 October 2011|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912011002/http://www.cectexas.org/research_%26_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2011}}</ref> with design-build contracts is an inherent conflict of interest. In a standard contract the architect works for the owner and is directly responsible to the owner. In design-build the architect works for the design-builder, not the owner, therefor the design-builder may make design and construction decisions that benefit the design-builder, but that do not benefit the owner. During construction, the architect normally acts as the owner's representative. This includes reviewing the builder's work and ensuring that the products and methods meet specifications and codes. The architect's role is compromised when the architect works for the design-builder and not for the owner directly. Thus, the owner may get a building that is over-designed to increase profits for the design-builder, or a building built with lesser-quality products to maximize profits.\n\n===Planning and scheduling===\nProject-management methodology is as follows:\n*Work breakdown structure\n*Project network of activities\n**[[Critical path method]] (CPM)\n**Resource management\n**Resource leveling\n**Risk assessment\n\n==={{anchor|Architecture\u2013Engineer}}Architecture\u2013engineer===\n*Work inspection\n*Change orders\n*Review payments\n*Materials and samples\n*Shop drawings\n*Three-dimensional image\n\n===Agency CM===\nConstruction cost management is a fee-based service in which the construction manager (CM) is responsible exclusively to the owner, acting in the owner's interests at every stage of the project. The construction manager offers impartial advice on matters such as:\n*Optimum use of available funds\n*Control of the scope of the work\n*Project scheduling\n*Optimum use of design and construction firms' skills and talents\n*Avoidance of delays, changes and disputes\n*Enhancing project design and construction quality\n*Optimum flexibility in contracting and procurement\n*Cash-flow management\n\nComprehensive management of every stage of the project, beginning with the original concept and project definition, yields the greatest benefit to owners. As time progresses beyond the pre-design phase, the CM's ability to effect cost savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing [[scope creep]]), helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering, cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application field of [[construction collaboration technology]] has been developed to apply information technology to construction management.\n\n===CM at-risk===\nCM at-risk is a delivery method which entails a commitment by the construction manager to deliver the project within a [[Guaranteed Maximum Price]] (GMP). The construction manager acts as a consultant to the owner in the development and design phases (preconstruction services), and as a general contractor during construction. When a construction manager is bound to a GMP, the fundamental character of the relationship is changed. In addition to acting in the owner's interest, the construction manager must control construction costs to stay within the GMP.\n\nCM at-risk is a global term referring to the business relationship of a construction contractor, owner and architect (or designer). Typically, a CM at-risk arrangement eliminates a \"low-bid\" construction project. A GMP agreement is a typical part of the CM-and-owner agreement (comparable to a \"low-bid\" contract), but with adjustments in responsibility for the CM. The advantage of a CM at-risk arrangement is budget management. Before a project's design is completed (six to eighteen months of coordination between designer and owner), the CM is involved with estimating the cost of constructing a project based on the goals of the designer and owner (design concept) and the project's scope. In balancing the costs, schedule, quality and scope of the project, the design may be modified instead of redesigned; if the owner decides to expand the project, adjustments can be made before pricing. To manage the budget before design is complete and construction crews mobilized, the CM conducts site management and purchases major items to efficiently manage time and cost.<ref name=\"The Risk in CM At-Risk\">{{cite journal |last=Strang |first=Warner |date=2002 |title=The Risk In CM \"At-Risk\" |url=https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |format=PDF |journal=CM eJournal |volume=4 |issue=9 |pages=3\u20138 |access-date=July 22, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084545/https://cmaanet.org/files/risk_in_cm_at_risk.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Advantages====\n*CM is working \"at risk\", therefore have incentive to act in the owner's interest, as well as to efficiently manage construction costs, considering they would be liable for any amount in excess of the GMP\n*Ability to handle changes in design or scope<ref name=\"Sierra Companies 2013\">{{cite web | title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Construction Delivery Methods | website=Sierra Companies | date=2013-01-14 | url=http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | accessdate=2015-07-22 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235725/http://sierracompanies.com/delivery_methods/ | archivedate=2015-07-22 }}</ref>\n\n====Drawbacks====\n*If a cost overrun occurred, it could cost the CM a great deal of money\n* The CM is allowed some mistake-related contingency, therefore there is a possibility that they will compensate by reducing the scope of the work to fit the GMP\n* Since the GMP is settled before design begins, it is difficult for owners to know whether they received the best possible bid<ref name=\"The Risk in CM At-Risk\"/>\n\n====Bottom line====\nAn at-risk delivery method is best for large projects\u2014both complete construction and renovation\u2014that are not easy to define, have a possibility of changing in scope, or have strict schedule deadlines.

Montana, Craig and Walsh would remain together until the 1988 season. Craig first became well known in his rookie year for his distinctive high-knee running technique.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (Roger Craig crop).jpg|right|thumb|Craig rushing the ball for the 49ers during Super Bowl XIX.]]\nIn [[Super Bowl XIX]] in January 1985, Craig rushed for 58 yards, caught seven passes for 77 yards, and became the first player ever to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl during the 49ers' 38\u201316 victory over the [[1984 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]].\n\nThe [[1985 San Francisco 49ers season|following season]], Craig became the first in NFL history to run and receive for at least 1,000 yards in the same season. He ran for 1,050 yards on 214 carries and led the NFL with 92 catches for 1,016 yards, and scored a team high 15 touchdowns. With fullback [[Tom Rathman]], also from Nebraska, the two formed the 49ers' \"Cornfield Backfield.\"{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn [[1988 San Francisco 49ers season|1988]], Craig was named [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award|NFL Offensive Player of the Year]] by the [[Associated Press]]. He ran for a career-high 1,502 yards and caught an additional 76 passes for 534 yards. A memorable game occurred in week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. He scored three rushing touchdowns and ran a career-high 191 yards. He went on to assist the 49ers to [[Super Bowl XXIII]] by amassing 262 combined rushing and receiving yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games. In the 49ers' 20-16 win over Cincinnati in that Super Bowl, he rushed for 71 yards and caught eight passes for 101 yards.\n\nIn the [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|1989]] season, the 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row, aided by Craig's 1,527 combined rushing/receiving yards and seven touchdowns in the season, along with his 240 combined rushing/receiving yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games. In San Francisco's 55-10 win over the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XXIV]], Craig rushed for 69 yards, caught five passes for 34 yards, and scored a touchdown.\n\nThe 49ers were 14\u20132 in the [[1990 San Francisco 49ers season|following regular season]] on their quest to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. In the [[NFC Championship]] Game (his last as a 49er), a hit by Giants Nose Tackle [[Erik Howard]] caused Craig to [[fumble]] the football that was recovered by Giants linebacker [[Lawrence Taylor]] late in the fourth quarter while the 49ers were trying to hold on to a 13\u201312 lead over the [[1990 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. Subsequent to the fumble recovery the Giants scored on a last-second field goal to win 15\u201313, and went on to win [[Super Bowl XXV]].\n\nIn eight seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, Craig played in 121 games and missed only seven games, five of them in his final season. Playing alongside [[Dwight Clark]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Tom Rathman]], [[Russ Francis]] and others in the 49ers diverse offense, Craig accounted for 11,506 yards from scrimmage, rushing for 7064 yards (4.2) and 50 touchdowns, and catching 508 passes for 4442 yards (8.7) and 16 touchdowns. in 16 playoff games with the 49ers, Craig had 817 yards rushing (4.0) with seven touchdowns and 63 receptions for 606 yards (9.7) and two touchdowns, as the 49ers won three Super Bowls.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CraiRo00.htm</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles Raiders (1991)===\nCraig left San Francisco and signed with the [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|1991]]. Sharing time with [[Marcus Allen]] and [[Nick Bell (American football)|Nick Bell]], Craig led the Raiders in rushing as he rushed for 590 yards and had 17 receptions for 136 yards. The Raiders finished 9\u20137 under head coach [[Art Shell]] and lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/1991.htm</ref>\n\n===Minnesota Vikings (1992\u20131993)===\nCraig played his final two seasons with the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. Playing behind [[Terry Allen (running back)|Terry Allen]] in 1992, Craig rushed for 416 yards and four touchdowns and caught 22 passes for 161 yards. The Vikings finished 11-5, winning the NFC Central Division and were defeated by the Washington Redskins in the playoffs.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/1992.htm</ref>\n\nIn his final season, Craig split time with [[Barry Word]], [[Scottie Graham]] and [[Robert Smith (running back)|Robert Smith]], as the Vikings finished 9-7, losing to the New York Giants in the playoffs. Craig rushed for 119 yards and 1 touchdown, catching 19 passed for 169 yards and 1 touchdown. Craig announced his retirement after the [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|1993]] season, signing a one day contract with the 49ers so he could retire as a 49er.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/1993.htm</ref><ref>https://rogercraig33.com/roger-craig-the-first-to-do-one-day-contract/</ref>\n\n==NFL career statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Craig finished his eleven NFL seasons with 8,189 rushing yards, 566 receptions for 4,911 receiving yards, and three kickoff returns for 43 yards. Overall, he amassed 13,143 total yards and scored 73 touchdowns (56 rushing and 17 receiving).\n\nCraig was the first running back to gain more than 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season (1985).  Since then, only two other running backs have achieved the same feat ([[Marshall Faulk]] in 1999, and [[Christian McCaffrey]] in 2019).  Craig also caught a then-record 92 passes in the 1985 campaign.  In 1988, Craig set a then-franchise record 1,502 yards rushing ([[Garrison Hearst]] broke the record with 1,570 yards in 1998. [[Frank Gore]] holds the current record with 1,695 yards in 2006).  The 1988 season was the second time Craig broke the 2,000 combined yardage mark in his career.\n\nCraig, [[Lydell Mitchell]] and [[Chuck Foreman]] are the only running backs to lead the NFL in receptions for a single season.\n\nCraig is one of three running backs to ever record 100 receiving yards or more in a Super Bowl (James White, New England Patriots, Super Bowl 51; Corey Clement, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl 52). His prowess as a receiver out of the backfield is a contrast to his college career, where he caught only 16 passes during his three seasons at Nebraska.\n\nIn 1993, [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] (in Inside the Helmet) reported that Craig was the only running back to be elected to the [[Pro Bowl]] at both [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] and [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]].\n\n== Honors ==\n* In 1987, Craig was inducted into the Quad City Sports Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qctimes.com/app/special/shof/profile.php?id=1 |title=Bio |website=qctimes.com |format=PHP}}</ref>\n\n* Craig was Inducted into the Davenport Central High School Hall of Honor in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davenportschools.org/central/alumni/hall-of-honor/dhschs-hall-of-honor-inductees/|title=DHS/CHS Hall of Honor Inductees - Central High School|website=www.davenportschools.org}}</ref>\n\n* In 1989, Craig was inducted into the [[Des Moines Register]]'s Sunday Register Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"desmoinesregister.com\"/> \n\n* Craig was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in 1989.<ref name=\"huskers.com\"/>\n\n* In 2002, Craig was inducted into the Iowa's IHSAA Football Players\u2019 Hall-of-Fame.

Craig finished his eleven NFL seasons with 8,189 rushing yards, 566 receptions for 4,911 receiving yards, and three kickoff returns for 43 yards. Overall, he amassed 13,143 total yards and scored 73 touchdowns (56 rushing and 17 receiving).\n\nCraig was the first running back to gain more than 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season (1985).  Since then, only two other running backs have achieved the same feat ([[Marshall Faulk]] in 1999, and [[Christian McCaffrey]] in 2019).  Craig also caught a then-record 92 passes in the 1985 campaign.  In 1988, Craig set a then-franchise record 1,502 yards rushing ([[Garrison Hearst]] broke the record with 1,570 yards in 1998. [[Frank Gore]] holds the current record with 1,695 yards in 2006).  The 1988 season was the second time Craig broke the 2,000 combined yardage mark in his career.\n\nCraig, [[Lydell Mitchell]] and [[Chuck Foreman]] are the only running backs to lead the NFL in receptions for a single season.\n\nCraig is one of three running backs to ever record 100 receiving yards or more in a Super Bowl (James White, New England Patriots, Super Bowl 51; Corey Clement, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl 52). His prowess as a receiver out of the backfield is a contrast to his college career, where he caught only 16 passes during his three seasons at Nebraska.\n\nIn 1993, [[Peter King (sportswriter)|Peter King]] (in Inside the Helmet) reported that Craig was the only running back to be elected to the [[Pro Bowl]] at both [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] and [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]].\n\n== Honors ==\n* In 1987, Craig was inducted into the Quad City Sports Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qctimes.com/app/special/shof/profile.php?id=1 |title=Bio |website=qctimes.com |format=PHP}}</ref>\n\n* Craig was Inducted into the Davenport Central High School Hall of Honor in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davenportschools.org/central/alumni/hall-of-honor/dhschs-hall-of-honor-inductees/|title=DHS/CHS Hall of Honor Inductees - Central High School|website=www.davenportschools.org}}</ref>\n\n* In 1989, Craig was inducted into the [[Des Moines Register]]'s Sunday Register Hall of Fame.<ref name=\"desmoinesregister.com\"/> \n\n* Craig was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in 1989.<ref name=\"huskers.com\"/>\n\n* In 2002, Craig was inducted into the Iowa's IHSAA Football Players\u2019 Hall-of-Fame.

General societal attitudes towards disfigurement have varied greatly across cultures and over time, with cultures possessing strong [[social stigma]] against it often causing [[psychological distress]] to disfigured individuals. Alternatively, many societies have regarded some forms of disfigurement in a medical, scientific context where someone having ill will against the disfigured is viewed as anathema. In various religious and spiritual contexts, disfigurement has been variously described as being a punishment from the divine for sin (such as [[Yahweh]]'s [[Curse and mark of Cain|defacement of Cain]] for [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s murder in Judaism), as being (such as [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] of the [[New Testament]]'s arguments about [[Christ]]'s sufferings) caused by [[supernatural]] forces of hate and [[conflict between good and evil|evil against the good]] and just, which will be later atoned for, or as being without explanation ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' with people just having to endure.\n\nThe topic has been frequently commented on and referred to in a great many forms of fictional media as well. [[Villain]]ous examples include the iconic fiend [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] from various [[DC Comics]] and the mysterious figure with a \"red right hand\" from the [[Red Right Hand|song of the same name]] by the band [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]. [[Hero]]ic examples include [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a crime-fighter who was rendered [[Blindness|blind]] (from [[Marvel Comics]]), and the compassionate character [[Edward Scissorhands]] from the film of the same name.\n\n==Overview==\nDisfigurement, whether caused by a benign or malignant condition, often leads to severe [[psychosocial]] problems such as negative [[body image]]; [[clinical depression|depression]]; difficulties in one's social, sexual, and professional lives; prejudice; and intolerance. This is partly due to how the individual copes with looking 'visibly different', though the extent of the disfigurement rarely correlates with the degree of distress the sufferer feels. An additional factor which affects sufferers of a disfigurement is the reaction they get from other people. The general population responds to people with a disfigurement with less trust and respect, and often try to avoid making contact or having to look at the disfigurement. Disfigurements affecting visible areas, such as the face, arms, and hands, are thought to present greater difficulty for sufferers to cope with than do other disfigurements.\n\nDeliberate mutilation resulting in physical disfigurement has also been practiced by many cultures throughout human history for religious or judicial purposes. During the [[Byzantine Empire]], the emperor was considered God's [[wikt:viceregent|viceregent]] on Earth, and as such, the physical wholeness of his person was an essential complement to the perfection of Heaven. For this reason, many deposed emperors were blinded, had [[Rhinotomy|their noses cut off]], or [[Tongue splitting|their tongue split]] by their successors, as these permanent disfigurements disqualified them from ever reclaiming the throne.\n\nA case of voluntary disfigurement is that of St. [[\u00c6bbe the Younger]] and the nuns of [[Coldingham Monastery]] in Scotland. When the monastery was attacked by [[Vikings]] and they feared being raped,  the nuns and she cut off their own noses and upper lips. In revenge, the Vikings burned down the building with the nuns inside. This is said to be the origin of the phrase \"[[cutting off the nose to spite the face]]\".\n\n==Causes==\nConditions that can cause disfigurement include: \n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*severe [[acne]]\n*[[acromegaly]]\n*[[Constriction ring syndrome|amniotic band constriction]]\n*[[amputation]]\n*[[argyria]]\n*[[birthmark]]s\n*[[burn (injury)|burns]]\n*[[cancer]]\n*[[cataract]]s\n*[[circumcision]]\n*[[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft lip]]\n*[[Dermatitis|eczema]]\n*[[elephantiasis]]\n*[[erysipelas]]\n*[[frostbite]]\n*[[gangrene]]\n*[[gigantomastia]]\n*[[gynecomastia]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[keloid]]s\n*[[leprosy]]\n*[[necrosis]]\n*[[McCune\u2013Albright syndrome]]\n*[[neurofibromatosis]]\n*[[noma (disease)|noma]]\n*[[paralysis]]\n*[[proteus syndrome]]\n*[[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]]\n*[[scalping]]\n*[[scar]]s\n*[[smallpox]]\n*severe [[strabismus]]\n*[[synkinesis]]\n*[[syphilis]]\n*[[vitiligo]]\n*severe [[wart]]s\n{{col-end}}\n[[Plastic surgery]] or [[reconstructive surgery]] is available in many cases to disfigured people. Some [[health insurance]] companies and government [[Health system|health care systems]] cover [[plastic surgery]] for these problems when they do not generally cover plastic surgery for what is labeled as \"cosmetic purposes\".\n\nThe term \"disfigurement\" is sometimes used pejoratively to describe the results of intentional [[body modification]]. [[Scarification]] and other forms of such modification are sometimes referred to as such by neutral parties or by advocates of the processes, as well. Many types of body modification are subject to strong social debate as such.\n\n==Society and culture==\nPeople with disfigurement are often treated poorly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=MOSAIC|first1=Neil Steinberg|title=Facial discrimination: Living with a disfigured face|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/23/health/facial-discrimination-disfigured-face/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> \n\n===In American fiction===\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n[[Image:ChaneyPhantomoftheOpera.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s version of \"[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]]\" in [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|the 1925 film ''The Phantom of the Opera]]'' had pervasive facial disfigurements, including jagged teeth and sunken-in eyes.]]\n*In most adaptations (literary, stage, film, or otherwise) of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the title character (known as \"[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]]\" or \"[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]]\") wears either a full- or half-face mask to conceal a disfigurement. Some adaptations infer that his disfigurement was present from birth, such as in the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (musical)|musical]], whereas others infer or show it to be the result of a horrible accident such as burning from fire or chemicals. The Phantom's disfigured face is usually described as having caused him anguish and despair, thus influencing him to adopt the enigmatic \"phantom\" persona.<ref>[http://operaghost.scriptmania.com/face.html The Phantom's Visage: What did the Phantom Look Like?]</ref>\n*The [[DC Comics]] character the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], often a foe of [[Batman]], possesses a [[clown]]-like grin and a grotesque combination of bleached skin, red lips, and green hair that are typically described or inferred to be the result of injuries and disfigurement in most media. A common origin of his skin and hair colors revolve around chemical burns as the result of the Joker character either falling into, jumping into, or being thrown into a vat of noxious chemicals. In [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film adaptation of ''Batman'']], the Joker character, in this version a criminal originally known as \"Jack Napier\", receives his distinct [[Risus sardonicus|rictus grin]] as the result of a botched [[plastic surgery]] that he received after a [[Ricochet|ricocheted bullet]] that Napier intended to harm Batman badly injured the Joker's face. In most media, the Joker's mania and insanity begin as a result of him seeing his own disfigurement, the 1989 film being an example.<ref>[http://batman.neoseeker.com/wiki/Joker Joker]</ref><ref>[http://www.ridingtohellinahandbasket.com/post/6946509702/the-juxtaposition-of-batman-and-joker The Juxtaposition of Batman and Joker]</ref><ref>{{YouTube|33JK0zOtJOk|Jack Napier (Joker) falls into a vat of chemical}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiAonyJIV_A The Joker Transformation! \"The Man In The Mirror\"]</ref>\n*Several enemies of fictional British secret agent [[James Bond]] have been known for their distinctive facial features. An example is the [[North Korea]]n criminal and [[Terrorism|terrorist]] Zao from the film ''[[Die Another Day]]''.

General societal attitudes towards disfigurement have varied greatly across cultures and over time, with cultures possessing strong [[social stigma]] against it often causing [[psychological distress]] to disfigured individuals. Alternatively, many societies have regarded some forms of disfigurement in a medical, scientific context where someone having ill will against the disfigured is viewed as anathema. In various religious and spiritual contexts, disfigurement has been variously described as being a punishment from the divine for sin (such as [[Yahweh]]'s [[Curse and mark of Cain|defacement of Cain]] for [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s murder in Judaism), as being (such as [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] of the [[New Testament]]'s arguments about [[Christ]]'s sufferings) caused by [[supernatural]] forces of hate and [[conflict between good and evil|evil against the good]] and just, which will be later atoned for, or as being without explanation ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' with people just having to endure.\n\nThe topic has been frequently commented on and referred to in a great many forms of fictional media as well. [[Villain]]ous examples include the iconic fiend [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] from various [[DC Comics]] and the mysterious figure with a \"red right hand\" from the [[Red Right Hand|song of the same name]] by the band [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]. [[Hero]]ic examples include [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], a crime-fighter who was rendered [[Blindness|blind]] (from [[Marvel Comics]]), and the compassionate character [[Edward Scissorhands]] from the film of the same name.\n\n==Overview==\nDisfigurement, whether caused by a benign or malignant condition, often leads to severe [[psychosocial]] problems such as negative [[body image]]; [[clinical depression|depression]]; difficulties in one's social, sexual, and professional lives; prejudice; and intolerance. This is partly due to how the individual copes with looking 'visibly different', though the extent of the disfigurement rarely correlates with the degree of distress the sufferer feels. An additional factor which affects sufferers of a disfigurement is the reaction they get from other people. The general population responds to people with a disfigurement with less trust and respect, and often try to avoid making contact or having to look at the disfigurement. Disfigurements affecting visible areas, such as the face, arms, and hands, are thought to present greater difficulty for sufferers to cope with than do other disfigurements.\n\nDeliberate mutilation resulting in physical disfigurement has also been practiced by many cultures throughout human history for religious or judicial purposes. During the [[Byzantine Empire]], the emperor was considered God's [[wikt:viceregent|viceregent]] on Earth, and as such, the physical wholeness of his person was an essential complement to the perfection of Heaven. For this reason, many deposed emperors were blinded, had [[Rhinotomy|their noses cut off]], or [[Tongue splitting|their tongue split]] by their successors, as these permanent disfigurements disqualified them from ever reclaiming the throne.\n\nA case of voluntary disfigurement is that of St. [[\u00c6bbe the Younger]] and the nuns of [[Coldingham Monastery]] in Scotland. When the monastery was attacked by [[Vikings]] and they feared being raped,  the nuns and she cut off their own noses and upper lips. In revenge, the Vikings burned down the building with the nuns inside. This is said to be the origin of the phrase \"[[cutting off the nose to spite the face]]\".\n\n==Causes==\nConditions that can cause disfigurement include: \n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*severe [[acne]]\n*[[acromegaly]]\n*[[Constriction ring syndrome|amniotic band constriction]]\n*[[amputation]]\n*[[argyria]]\n*[[birthmark]]s\n*[[burn (injury)|burns]]\n*[[cancer]]\n*[[cataract]]s\n*[[circumcision]]\n*[[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft lip]]\n*[[Dermatitis|eczema]]\n*[[elephantiasis]]\n*[[erysipelas]]\n*[[frostbite]]\n*[[gangrene]]\n*[[gigantomastia]]\n*[[gynecomastia]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[keloid]]s\n*[[leprosy]]\n*[[necrosis]]\n*[[McCune\u2013Albright syndrome]]\n*[[neurofibromatosis]]\n*[[noma (disease)|noma]]\n*[[paralysis]]\n*[[proteus syndrome]]\n*[[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]]\n*[[scalping]]\n*[[scar]]s\n*[[smallpox]]\n*severe [[strabismus]]\n*[[synkinesis]]\n*[[syphilis]]\n*[[vitiligo]]\n*severe [[wart]]s\n{{col-end}}\n[[Plastic surgery]] or [[reconstructive surgery]] is available in many cases to disfigured people. Some [[health insurance]] companies and government [[Health system|health care systems]] cover [[plastic surgery]] for these problems when they do not generally cover plastic surgery for what is labeled as \"cosmetic purposes\".\n\nThe term \"disfigurement\" is sometimes used pejoratively to describe the results of intentional [[body modification]]. [[Scarification]] and other forms of such modification are sometimes referred to as such by neutral parties or by advocates of the processes, as well. Many types of body modification are subject to strong social debate as such.\n\n==Society and culture==\nPeople with disfigurement are often treated badly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=MOSAIC|first1=Neil Steinberg|title=Facial discrimination: Living with a disfigured face|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/23/health/facial-discrimination-disfigured-face/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===In American fiction===\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n[[Image:ChaneyPhantomoftheOpera.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s version of \"[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]]\" in [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|the 1925 film ''The Phantom of the Opera]]'' had pervasive facial disfigurements, including jagged teeth and sunken-in eyes.]]\n*In most adaptations (literary, stage, film, or otherwise) of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the title character (known as \"[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]]\" or \"[[Erik (Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]]\") wears either a full- or half-face mask to conceal a disfigurement. Some adaptations infer that his disfigurement was present from birth, such as in the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (musical)|musical]], whereas others infer or show it to be the result of a horrible accident such as burning from fire or chemicals. The Phantom's disfigured face is usually described as having caused him anguish and despair, thus influencing him to adopt the enigmatic \"phantom\" persona.<ref>[http://operaghost.scriptmania.com/face.html The Phantom's Visage: What did the Phantom Look Like?]</ref>\n*The [[DC Comics]] character the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], often a foe of [[Batman]], possesses a [[clown]]-like grin and a grotesque combination of bleached skin, red lips, and green hair that are typically described or inferred to be the result of injuries and disfigurement in most media. A common origin of his skin and hair colors revolve around chemical burns as the result of the Joker character either falling into, jumping into, or being thrown into a vat of noxious chemicals. In [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film adaptation of ''Batman'']], the Joker character, in this version a criminal originally known as \"Jack Napier\", receives his distinct [[Risus sardonicus|rictus grin]] as the result of a botched [[plastic surgery]] that he received after a [[Ricochet|ricocheted bullet]] that Napier intended to harm Batman badly injured the Joker's face.

The historical ties between France and the UK, and the countries preceding them, are long and complex, including conquest, [[Anglo-French War (disambiguation)|wars]], and [[Anglo-French alliance (disambiguation)|alliances]] at various points in history. The [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] saw both areas, except [[Northern England]] and [[Scotland]], conquered by Rome, whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day, and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas; however, the language barrier remained. The [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 decisively shaped English history, as well as the English language. In the [[Middle Ages]], the countries were often bitter enemies, with both nations' monarchs [[English claims to the French throne|claiming control over France]]. Some of the noteworthy conflicts include the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] which were French victories, as well as the [[Seven Years' War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], from which Great Britain emerged victorious.\n\nThe last major conflict between the two were the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in which coalitions of European powers, financed and usually led by the United Kingdom fought a series of wars against the [[First French Empire]] and its client states, culminating in the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815. There were some subsequent tensions, especially after 1880, over such issues as the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Scramble for Africa|rivalry for African colonies]]. Despite some brief war scares, peace always prevailed. Friendly ties between the two began with the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]], and the British and French were allied against Germany in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]; in the latter conflict, British armies helped to [[Free France#Liberation of France|liberate]] [[occupied France]] from the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. Both nations opposed the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]] and were founding members of [[NATO]], the Western military alliance led by the United States. During the 1960s, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] distrusted the British for being [[Special Relationship|too close to the Americans]], and for years he blocked British entry into the European common market, now called the [[European Union]]. De Gaulle also pulled France out of its active role in NATO because that alliance was too heavily dominated by Washington. After his death, Britain did enter the European Union, and France returned to NATO.\n\nIn recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship, especially on defence and foreign policy issues; the two countries tend, however, to disagree on a range of other matters, most notably the [[European Union]].<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2011/12/britain-and-france Britain and France: the impossible, indispensable relationship ], ''[[The Economist]]'', 1 Dec 2011</ref> France and Britain are often still referred to as \"historic rivals\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/05/british-and-french-economies-same-problem Economies of Britain and France have more similarities than differences], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 January 2014</ref> or with emphasis on the perceived ever-lasting competition that still opposes the two countries.<ref>\"The two countries are forever comparing one against the other.[...]\", [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25959465 Britain-France ties: How cordial is the entente?], [[BBC News]], 30 January 2014</ref> French author Jos\u00e9-Alain Fralon characterised the relationship between the countries by describing the British as \"our most dear enemies\".\n\nUnlike France, the United Kingdom left the [[European Union]] in 2020, after it voted to do so in a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] held on 23 June 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887|title=The UK's EU referendum: All you need to know \u2013 BBC News|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> It is estimated that about 350,000 French people [[French migration to the United Kingdom|live in the UK]], with approximately 400,000 Britons [[British migration to France|living in France]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/pays-zones-geo_833/royaume-uni_202/index.html Royaume-Uni] \u2013 France Diplomacie</ref>\n\n==Country comparison==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

As a consequence, Caesar felt compelled to invade in an attempt to subdue Britain. Rome was reasonably successful at conquering Gaul and Britain and Belgica all; and all three areas became provinces of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nFor the next five hundred years, there was much interaction between the two regions, as both Britain and France were under Roman rule. After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], this was followed by another five hundred years with very little interaction between the two, as both were invaded by different [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes. [[Anglo-Saxon]]ism rose from a mixture of Brythonism and [[Scandinavia]]n immigration in Britain to conquer the Picts and Gaels. France saw intermixture with and partial conquest by [[Germanic tribes]] such as the [[Salian Franks]] to create the [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdoms. [[Christianity]] as a religion spread through all areas involved during this period, replacing the Germanic, Celtic and pre-Celtic forms of worship. The deeds of chieftains in this period would produce the legendaria around [[King Arthur]] and [[Camelot]] \u2013 now believed to be a legend based on the deeds of many early medieval British chieftains \u2013 and the more historically verifiable [[Charlemagne]], the Frankish chieftain who founded the [[Holy Roman Empire]] throughout much of Western Europe. At the turn of the second millennium, the [[British Isles]] were primarily involved with the [[Scandinavia]]n world, while France's main foreign relationship was with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Christopher A. Snyder, ''The Britons'' (2003) (Author</ref>\n\n===Before the Conquest===\nPrior to the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, there were no armed conflicts between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of France]]. France and England were subject to repeated [[Viking invasions]], and their foreign preoccupations were primarily directed toward Scandinavia.\n\nSuch cross-Channel relations as England had were directed toward Normandy, a quasi-independent fief owing homage to the French king; [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], daughter of Normandy's Duke [[Richard I, Duke of Normandy|Richard]], became queen to two English kings in succession; two of her sons, [[Harthacnut]] and [[Edward the Confessor]] later became kings of England. Edward spent much of his early life (1013\u20131041) in Normandy and, as king, favored certain Normans with high office, such as [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]], who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].\n\nThis gradual Normanization of the realm set the stage for the Norman Conquest, in which Emma's brother's grandson, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of Normandy, gained the kingdom in the first successful cross-Channel invasion since Roman times. Together with its new ruler, England acquired the foreign policy of the Norman dukes, which was based on protecting and expanding Norman interests at the expense of the French Kings. Although William's rule over Normandy had initially had the backing of King [[Henry I of France]], William's success had soon created hostility, and in 1054 and 1057 King Henry had twice attacked Normandy.\n\n===Norman conquest===\nHowever, in the mid-eleventh century there was a dispute over the English throne, and the French-speaking [[Normans]], who were of Viking stock, invaded England under their duke [[William the Conqueror]] and took over following the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, and crowned themselves [[Kings of England]]. The Normans took control of the land and the political system. [[Feudal culture]] took root in England, and for the next 150 years England was generally considered of secondary importance to the dynasty's Continental territories, notably in Normandy and other western French provinces. The language of the [[aristocracy]] was French for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest. Many French words were adopted into the English language as a result. About [[List of English words of French origin|one third of the English language]] is derived from or through various forms of French. The first Norman kings were also the [[Duke of Normandy|Dukes of Normandy]], so relations were somewhat complicated between the countries. Though they were dukes ostensibly under the king of France, their higher level of organisation in Normandy gave them more de facto power. In addition, they were kings of England in their own right; England was not officially a province of France, nor a province of Normandy.<ref>Richard Huscroft, ''The Norman Conquest: A New Introduction'' (2009).</ref>\n\n===Breton War, 1076\u20131077===\nThis war was fought between the years 1076 to 1077.<ref>George Beech, ''Was the Bayeux Tapestry Made in France?''

With this buffer state eliminated, Normandy and the king's royal demesne (the [[\u00cele-de-France]]) now directly bordered on each other, and the region would be the flashpoint for several future wars. In 1087, William responded to border raids conducted by Philip's soldiers by attacking the town of [[Mantes]], during the sack of which he received an accidental injury that turned fatal.\n\n===Rebellion of 1088===\n{{main|Rebellion of 1088}}\nWith William's death, his realms were parted between his two sons (England to [[William II of England|William Rufus]], Normandy to [[Robert Curthose]]) and the Norman-French border war concluded. Factional strains between the Norman barons, faced with a double loyalty to William's two sons, created a brief civil war in which an attempt was made to force Rufus off the English throne. With the failure of the rebellion, England and Normandy were clearly divided for the first time since 1066.\n\n===Wars in the Vexin and Maine, 1097\u20131098===\nRobert Curthose left on crusade in 1096, and for the duration of his absence Rufus took over the administration of Normandy. Soon afterwards (1097) he attacked the Vexin and the next year the [[County of Maine]]. Rufus succeeded in defeating Maine, but the war in the Vexin ended inconclusively with a truce in 1098.<ref>Frank Barlow, ''William Rufus'' (Yale UP, 2000).</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Norman War, 1101===\nIn August 1100, William Rufus was killed by an arrow shot while hunting. His younger brother, [[Henry I of England|Henry Beauclerc]] immediately took the throne. It had been expected to go to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, but Robert was away on a crusade and did not return until a month after Rufus' death, by which time Henry was firmly in control of England, and his accession had been recognized by France's [[Philip I of France|King Philip]]. Robert was, however, able to reassert his control over Normandy, though only after giving up the County of Maine.\n\nEngland and Normandy were now in the hands of the two brothers, Henry and Robert. In July 1101, Robert launched an attack on England from Normandy. He landed successfully at Portsmouth, and advanced inland to [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] in Hampshire. There he and Henry came to an [[Treaty of Alton|agreement]] to accept the ''status quo'' of the territorial division. Henry was freed from his homage to Robert, and agreed to pay the Duke an annual sum (which, however, he only paid until 1103).<ref>C. Warren Hollister, \"The strange death of William Rufus.\" ''Speculum'' 48.4 (1973): 637\u2013653.</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Norman War, 1105\u20131106===\nFollowing increasing tensions between the brothers, and evidence of the weakness of Robert's rule, Henry I invaded Normandy in the spring of 1105, landing at Barfleur. The ensuing Anglo-Norman war was longer and more destructive, involving sieges of [[Bayeux]] and [[Caen]]; but Henry had to return to England in the late summer, and it was not until the following summer that he was able to resume the conquest of Normandy. In the interim, Duke Robert took the opportunity to appeal to his liege lord, King Philip, but could obtain no aid from him. The fate of Robert and the duchy was sealed at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]] on 28 or 29 September 1106: Robert was captured and imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry was now, like his father, both King of England and Duke of Normandy, and the stage was set for a new round of conflict between England and France.\n\n===Anglo-French War, 1117\u20131120===\nIn 1108, Philip I, who had been king of France since before the Norman Conquest, died and was succeeded by his son [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]], who had already been conducting the administration of the realm in his father's name for several years.\n\nLouis had initially been hostile to Robert Curthose, and friendly to Henry I; but with Henry's acquisition of Normandy, the old Norman-French rivalries re-emerged. From 1109 to 1113, clashes erupted in the Vexin; and in 1117 Louis made a pact with [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]], [[Fulk V of Anjou]], and various rebellious Norman barons to overthrow Henry's rule in Normandy and replace him with [[William Clito]], Curthose's son. By luck and diplomacy, however, Henry eliminated the Flemings and Angevins from the war, and on 20 August 1119 at the [[Battle of Bremule]] he defeated the French. Louis was obliged to accept Henry's rule in Normandy, and accepted his son [[William Adelin]]'s homage for the fief in 1120.\n\n===High medieval era===\n{{further|Anglo-French war of 1202\u201314|First Barons' War|Saintonge War|War of Saint-Sardos}}\n[[File:BeaulieuAbbey5.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Beaulieu Abbey]], founded by [[King John of England]] for [[Cistercians]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newforestexplorersguide.co.uk/sitefolders/villages/beaulieu/historyintro/beaulieuhistorypage.html | title=New Forest Heritage}}</ref> a religious order from France who gave the Abbey its present name, French for \"beautiful place\"]]\n\nDuring the reign of the closely related [[Plantagenet]] dynasty, which was based in its [[Angevin Empire]], half of France was under Angevin control as well as all of England. However, almost all of the Angevin empire was lost to [[Philip II of France]] under [[Richard the Lionheart]], John and Henry III of England. This finally gave the English a separate identity as an Anglo-Saxon people under a Francophone, but not French, crown.<ref>Dan Jones and Clive Chafer, ''The Plantagenets: The Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England'' (2013).</ref>\n\nWhile the English and French had been frequently acrimonious, they had always had a common culture and little fundamental difference in identity. Nationalism had been minimal in days when most wars took place between rival feudal lords on a sub-national scale. The last attempt to unite the two cultures under such lines was probably a failed French-supported rebellion to depose Edward II. It was also during the Middle Ages that a Franco-Scottish alliance, known as the [[Auld Alliance]] was signed by King [[John of Scotland]] and [[Philip IV of France]].<ref>Maurice Powicke, ''The Thirteenth Century, 1216\u20131307'' (Oxford History of England, 1962).</ref>\n\n===The Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main|The Hundred Years' War}}\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|right|210px|During the [[Hundred Years' War]] England and France battled for supremacy.

Though the war was in principle a mere dispute over territory, it drastically changed societies on both sides of the Channel.

[[Bertrand du Guesclin]] was a brilliant tactician who forced the English out of the lands they had procured at the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]], a compromising treaty that most Frenchmen saw as a humiliation. [[Joan of Arc]] was another unifying figure who to this day represents a combination of religious fervour and French patriotism to all France. After her inspirational victory at Orl\u00e9ans and what many saw as Joan's martyrdom at the hands of Burgundians and Englishmen, [[Jean de Dunois]] eventually forced the English out of all of France except [[Calais]], which was only lost in 1558. Apart from setting national identities, the Hundred Years' War was the root of the traditional rivalry and at times hatred between the two countries. During this era, the English lost their last territories in France, except Calais, which would remain in English hands for another 105 years, though the English monarchs continued to style themselves as Kings of France until 1800.<ref>May McKisack, ''The Fourteenth Century, 1307\u20131399'' (Oxford History of England, 1959).</ref>\n\n===The Franco-Scots Alliance===\n{{Main|Auld Alliance}}\n\nFrance and [[Scotland]] agreed to defend each other in the event of an attack on either from England in several [[treaty|treaties]], the most notable of which were in 1327 and 1490. There had always been intermarriage between the Scottish and French royal households, but this solidified the bond between the royals even further.<ref>Norman Macdougall, ''An Antidote to the English: The Auld Alliance, 1295\u20131560'' (2001)</ref>\nScottish historian [[J.

They took opposite sides in all of the [[Italian Wars]] between 1494 and 1559.\n\nAn even deeper division set in during the [[English Reformation]], when most of England converted to Protestantism and France remained Roman Catholic. This enabled each side to see the other as not only a foreign evil but also a heretical one. In both countries there was intense civil religious conflict. Because of the oppression by Roman Catholic King [[Louis XIII of France]], many Protestant [[Huguenots]] fled to England. Similarly, many Catholics fled from England to France.  Scotland had a very close relationship with France in the 16th century, with intermarriage at the highest level.\n\n[[Henry VIII of England]] had initially sought an alliance with France, and the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] saw a face to face meeting between him and King [[Francis I of France]].  [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (1542\u20131587) Was born to King [[James V]] and his French second wife, [[Mary of Guise]] and became Queen when her father was killed in the wars with England. Her mother became Regent, brought in French advisors, and ruled Scotland in the French style. David Ditchburn and Alastair MacDonald argue:\n:Protestantism was, however, given an enormous boost in Scotland, especially among the governing classes, by the suffocating political embrace of Catholic France. The threat to Scotland's independence seem to come most potently from France, not England... And absorption by France was not a future that appealed to Scots.<ref>David Ditchburn and Alastair MacDonald, \"Medieval Scotland: 1100\u20131560,\" in R.A.

Key to English strategy was the fear that a [[universal monarchy]] of Europe would be able to overwhelm the [[British Isles]].<ref>Simms p.11-25</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the English Civil War, the newly formed Republic under Oliver Cromwell, \"the Commonwealth of England\" joined sides with the French against Spain during the last decade of the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659). The English were particularly interested in the troublesome city of Dunkirk and in accordance with the alliance the city was given to the English after the Battle of the Dunes (1658), but after the monarchy was restored in England, Charles II sold it back to the French in 1662 for \u00a3320,000. \n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Thirty Years War (1618\u20131648)[[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, and as France finally overcame its rebellious \"princes of the blood\" and Protestant Huguenots, the long fought wars of the Fronde (civil wars) finally came to an end. At the same time Spain's power was severely weakened by decades of wars and rebellions \u2013 and France, began to take on a more assertive role under King [[Louis XIV of France]] with an expansionist policy both in Europe and across the globe. English foreign policy was now directed towards preventing France gaining supremacy on the continent and creating a universal monarchy. To the French, England was an isolated and piratical nation heavily reliant on naval power, and particularly [[privateers]], which they referred to as [[Perfidious Albion]].\n\nHowever, in 1672, the English again formed an alliance with the French (in accordance with the Secret Treaty of Dover of 1670) against their common commercial rival, the rich Dutch Republic \u2013 the two nations fighting side by side during the Franco-Dutch War (1672\u20131678) and Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672\u20131674). This war was extremely unpopular in England. The English had been soundly beaten at sea by the Dutch and were in a worsening financial situation as their vulnerable global trade was under increasing threat. The English pulled out of the alliance in 1674, ending their war with the Netherlands and actually joining them against the French in the final year of the Franco-Dutch War in 1678.\n\nDuring the course of the century a sharp diversion in political philosophies emerged in the two states. In England King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed during the [[English Civil War]] for exceeding his powers, and later King [[James II of England|James II]] had been overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]]. In France, the decades long Fronde (civil wars), had seen the French Monarchy triumphant and as a result the power of the monarchs and their advisors became almost absolute and went largely unchecked.\n\n[[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] fought each other in the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]] from 1688 to 1697 which set the pattern for relations between France and Great Britain during the eighteenth century. Wars were fought intermittently, with each nation part of a constantly shifting pattern of alliances known as the [[stately quadrille]].\n\n===Second Hundred Years' War 1689\u20131815===\n{{Main|Second Hundred Years' War|International relations, 1648\u20131814}}\n\n====18th century====\n[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|right|160px|The [[Act of Union (1707)|Act of Union]] was passed in 1707 partly to unify Great Britain against the perceived French threat.]]\n\nPartly out of fear of a continental intervention, an Act of Union was passed in 1707 creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and formally merging the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] (the latter kingdom included [[Wales]]).<ref>Simms p.51-3</ref> While the new Britain grew increasingly [[Parliament of Great Britain|parliamentarian]], France continued its system of [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>J.

The main powers had exhausted themselves in warfare, with many deaths, disabled veterans, ruined navies, high pension costs, heavy loans and high taxes. Utrecht strengthened the sense of useful international law and inaugurated an era of relative stability in the European state system, based on balance-of-power politics that no one country would become dominant.<ref>Dale Miquelon, \"Envisioning the French Empire: Utrecht, 1711\u20131713.\" ''French Historical Studies'' 24.4 (2001): 653\u2013677.</ref> [[Robert Walpole]], the key British policy maker, prioritized peace in Europe because it was good for his trading nation and its growing [[British Empire]].

Trevelyan, ''A Shortened History of England'' (1942) p 363.</ref>\nBut \"balance\" needed armed enforcement. Britain played a key military role as \"balancer.\" The goals were to bolster Europe's balance of power system to maintain peace that was needed for British trade to flourish and its colonies to grow, and finally to strengthen its own central position in the balance of power system in which no one could dominate the rest.  Other nations recognized Britain as the \"balancer.\"  Eventually the balancing act required Britain to contain French ambitions. Containment led to a series of increasingly large-scale wars between Britain and France, which ended with mixed results. Britain was usually aligned with the Netherlands and Prussia, and subsidised their armies. These wars enveloped all of Europe and the overseas colonies. These wars took place in every decade starting in the 1740s and climaxed in the defeat of Napoleon's France in 1814.<ref>Michael Sheehan, \"Balance of power intervention: Britain's decisions for or against war, 1733\u201356.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 7.2 (1996): 271\u2013289. {{doi|10.1080/09592299608406004}}</ref>\n\nAs the century wore on, there was a distinct passage of power to Britain and France, at the expense of traditional major powers such as Portugal, Spain and the [[Dutch Republic]]. Some observers saw the frequent conflicts between the two states during the 18th century as a battle for control of Europe, though most of these wars ended without a conclusive victory for either side.

They were supported by [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] and by the [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], Minister for War and for the Navy.  In 1763, [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Louis Bougainville]] sailed from France with two ships, several families, cattle, horses and grain. He established the first colony in the [[Falkland Islands]] at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Saint Louis]] in February 1764. This done, Bougainville's plan was to use the new settlement as a French base from where he could mount a search for the long-imagined (but still undiscovered) [[Terra Australis|Southern Continent]] and claim it for France.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hodson |first1=Christopher |title=The Acadian Diaspora |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199739776}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary of the [[Admiralty]], [[Sir Philip Stephens, 1st Baronet|Philip Stephens]], swiftly and secretly dispatched [[John Byron]] to the Falklands and round the world. He was followed in 1766 by [[Samuel Wallis]] who discovered [[Tahiti]] and claimed it for Britain.

In 1769, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Marie de Surville|Jean Surville]] sailed from India, through the [[Coral Sea]] to New Zealand then traversed the Pacific to [[Peru]]. In 1771, [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne|Marion Dufresne]] and Julien\u2013Marie Crozet sailed through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Later in 1771, another French expedition under [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec|Yves de Kerguelen]] and [[Louis Aleno de St Alo\u00fcarn|Louis St Alo\u00fcarn]] explored the southern Indian Ocean. St Alo\u00fcarn annexed the west coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] for France in March 1772.\n\nIn August 1785, [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] sent [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lap\u00e9rouse]] to explore the Pacific Ocean.

While France was plunged into chaos, Britain took advantage of its temporary weakness to stir up the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|civil war occurring in France]] and build up its naval forces. The Revolution was initially popular with many Britons, both because it appeared to weaken France and was perceived to be based on British liberal ideals. This began to change as the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] faction took over, and began the [[Reign of Terror]] (or simply the Terror, for short).<ref>Jeremy Black, ''British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783\u20131793'' (1994) ch 9</ref>\n\nThe French were intent on spreading their [[revolutionary republicanism]] to other European states, including Britain. The British initially stayed out of the alliances of European states which unsuccessfully attacked France trying to restore the monarchy. In France a new, strong nationalism took hold enabling them to mobilise large and motivated forces. Following the execution of King [[Louis XVI of France]] in 1793, France declared war on Britain. This period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] was known as the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Except for a brief pause in 1802\u201303, the wars lasted continuously for 21 years. During this time Britain raised several coalitions against the French, continually subsidising other European states with the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]], enabling them to put large armies in the field. In spite of this, the French armies were very successful on land, creating several client states such as the [[Batavian Republic]], and the British devoted much of their own forces to campaigns against the French in the Caribbean, with mixed results.<ref>Steven T.

This period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] was known as the [[War of the First Coalition]], which lasted from 1792 to 1797.\n\nThe British policy was to give financial and diplomatic support continental allies, who did nearly all of the actual fighting on land. France meanwhile set up the conscription system that built up a much larger army than anyone else. After the king was executed, nearly all the senior officers went into exile, and a very young new generation of officers, typified by Napoleon, took over the French military. Britain relied heavily on the Royal Navy, which sank the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798, trapping the French army in Egypt. In 1799, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] came to power in France, and created a dictatorship. Britain led the [[Second Coalition]] from 1798 to 1802 against Napoleon, but he generally prevailed. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of 1802 was favorable to France. That treaty amounted to a year-long truce in the war, which was reopened by Britain in May 1803.\n\n[[File:Maniac-Ravings-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|330px|left|\"Maniac-raving's-or-Little Boney in a strong fit\" by [[James Gillray]].

The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007)</ref> argues that Britain was insulted and alarmed especially by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Britons felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire), and ought to shut down the London newspapers that were vilifying Napoleon. Russia, furthermore, decided that the Switzerland intervention indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution.<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007) pp 42\u201343</ref> Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses \u2013 an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" However, in the end it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to British national interest. Furthermore, Napoleon was not ready for war and this was the best time for Britain to stop them.<ref>McLynn, ''Napoleon: A Biography'' (1997) p. 69</ref> Britain therefore seized upon the Malta issue (by refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island).\n\nThe deeper British grievances were that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines.<ref>John D.

That plan collapsed after the annihilation of the Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar, coinciding with an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] attack over its [[Bavaria]]n allies.\n\nIn response Napoleon established a [[continental system]] by which no nation was permitted to trade with the British. Napoleon hoped the embargo would isolate the [[British Isles]] severely weakening them, but a number of countries continued to trade with them in defiance of the policy. In spite of this, the Napoleonic influence stretched across much of Europe.\n\nIn 1808 French forces invaded Portugal trying to attempt to halt trade with Britain, turning Spain into a [[satellite state]] in the process.<ref>Esdaile p.1-36</ref> The British responded by dispatching a force under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]] which captured Lisbon.<ref>Esdaile p.87-108</ref> Napoleon dispatched increasing forces into the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which became the key battleground between the two nations. Allied with Spanish and Portuguese forces, the British inflicted a number of defeats on the French, confronted with a new kind of warfare called \"[[guerrilla]]\" which led Napoleon to brand it the \"Spanish Ulcer\".\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon's invasion of Russia caused a new coalition to form against him, in what became the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].In 1813, British forces defeated French forces in Spain and caused them to retreat into France. Allied to an increasingly resurgent European coalition, the British invaded southern France in October 1813, forcing Napoleon to abdicate and go into exile on [[Elba]] in 1814.<ref>Esdaile p503-6</ref>\n\n[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Allied victory at Waterloo in 1815 marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Era]].

With strong British support, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy was restored and [[Louis XVIII]] was crowned King of France. The [[Napoleonic era]] was the last occasion on which Britain and France went to war with each other, but by no means marked the end of the rivalry between the two nations.

The British developed India and Canada and colonized Australia, spreading their powers to several different continents as the [[Second British Empire]]. Likewise the French were quite active in Southeast Asia and Africa.\n\nThey frequently made stereotypical jokes about each other, and even side by side in war were critical of each other's tactics. As a Royal Navy officer said to the French [[French corsairs|corsair]] [[Robert Surcouf]] \"You French fight for money, while we British fight for honour.\", [[Robert Surcouf|Surcouf]] replied \"Sir, a man fights for what he lacks the most.\" According to one story, a French diplomat once said to Lord Palmerston \"If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman\"; to which Palmerston replied: \"If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman.\"<ref>[[William Ewart Gladstone]] recounting the conversation to [[Lord Rendel]] in 1889, from F.

The major European powers\u2014[[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], Britain, and to some extent [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]\u2014were determined to keep France in check, and so France generally pursued a cautious foreign policy. Louis-Phillipe allied with Britain, the country with which France shared the most similar form of government, and its combative Foreign Secretary [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. In Louis-Philippe's first year in power, he refused to annex Belgium during [[Belgian Revolution|its revolution]], instead following the British line of supporting independence. Despite posturings from leading French minister [[Adolphe Thiers]] in 1839\u20131840 that France would protect the increasingly powerful [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] (a viceroy of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), any reinforcements were not forthcoming, and in 1840, much to France's embarrassment, Ali was forced to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] by the powers. Relations cooled again under the governments of [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] and [[Robert Peel]]. They soured once more in 1846 though when, with Palmerston back as Foreign Secretary, the French government hastily agreed to have [[Isabella II of Spain]] and her sister marry members of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and Orl\u00e9anist dynasties, respectively.

However [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] was elected president of France in 1848 and made himself Emperor Napoleon III in 1851. Napoleon III had an expansionist foreign policy, which saw the French deepen the [[colonisation of Africa]] and establish new colonies, in particular [[Indochina]]. The British were initially alarmed, and commissioned a series of forts in southern England designed to resist a French invasion. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] as foreign minister and prime minister had close personal ties with leading French statesmen, notably Napoleon III himself.

After a brief threat of an invasion of Britain in 1851, France and Britain cooperated in the 1850s, with an alliance in the Crimean War, and a major trade treaty in 1860.  The [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty]] Of 1860 lowered tariffs in each direction, and began the British practice of encouraging lower tariffs across Europe, and using most favored nation treaties.

This period in the first decade of the 20th century became known as the ''Entente Cordiale'', and continued in spirit until the 1940s.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 '' (2014) pp 142\u201371.</ref> The signing of the Entente Cordiale also marked the end of almost a millennium of intermittent conflict between the two nations and their predecessor states, and the formalisation of the peaceful co-existence that had existed since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Up to 1940, relations between Britain and France were closer than [[United Kingdom \u2013 United States relations|those between Britain and the US]].<ref>P. J. V.

Britain entered when the German army invaded neutral Belgium (on its way to attack Paris); that was intolerable. It joined France, sending a large army to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].<ref>David French, ''British Strategy and War Aims 1914\u20131916'' (Routledge, 2014).</ref>\n\nThere was close co-operation between the British and French forces. French Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph Joffre]] worked to coordinate Allied military operations and to mount a combined Anglo-French offensive on the Western Front. The result was the great [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916 with massive casualties on both sides and no gains.<ref>Roy A.

Both were also keen to protect and expand their empires, in the face of calls for self-determination. On a visit to London, French leader [[Georges Clemenceau]] was hailed by the British crowds. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] was given a similar reception in Paris.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''Peacemakers: Six Months that Changed the World'' (John Murray, 2003)</ref>\n\nLloyd George worked hard to moderate French demands for revenge.  Clemenceau wanted terms to cripple Germany's war potential that were too harsh for Wilson and Lloyd George.  A compromise was reached whereby Clemenceau softened his terms and the U.S. and Britain promised a Security Treaty that would guarantee armed intervention by both if Germany invaded France.  The British ratified the treaty on condition the U.S. ratified.  in the United States Senate, the Republicans were supportive, but Wilson insisted this security treaty be closely tied to the overall Versailles Treaty, and Republicans refused and so it never came to a vote in the Senate. Thus there was no treaty at all to help defend France.<ref>Erik Goldstein, ''Winning the peace: British diplomatic strategy, peace planning, and the Paris Peace Conference, 1916\u20131920'' (1991).</ref><ref>Lloyd E.

Cohrs, ''The unfinished peace after world war 1: America, Britain and the stabilization of Europe, 1919\u20131932'' (2006).</ref>\n\n====1920s====\nBoth states joined the [[League of Nations]], and both signed agreements of defence of several countries, most significantly Poland. The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] split the Middle East between the two states, in the form of [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]]. However the outlook of the nations were different during the inter-war years; while France saw itself inherently as a European power, Britain enjoyed close relationships with Australia, Canada and New Zealand and supported the idea of imperial free trade, a form of protectionism that would have seen large tariffs placed on goods from France.\n\nIn the 1920s, financial instability was a major problem for France, and other nations as well. it was vulnerable to short-term concerted action by banks and financial institutions by heavy selling or buying, in the financial crisis could weaken governments, and be used as a diplomatic threat. Premier and Finance Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] decided to stabilise the franc to protect against political currency manipulation by Germany and Britain. His solution in 1926 was a return to a fixed parity against gold. France was not able to turn the tables and use short-term financial advantage as leverage against Britain on important policy matters.<ref>John Keiger, \"Wielding Finance as a Weapon of Diplomacy: France and Britain in the 1920s,\" ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#1 pp 29\u201347</ref>\n\nin general, France and Britain were aligned in their position on major issues. A key reason was the Francophile position of Foreign Minister [[Austen Chamberlain]], and the ambassador to Paris [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|the Marquess of Crewe]] (1922\u201328). They promoted a pro-French policy regarding French security and disarmament policy, the later stages of the Ruhr crisis, the implementation of the Geneva Protocol, the Treaty of Locarno and the origins of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.<ref>Gaynor Johnson, \"Sir Austen Chamberlain, the Marquess of Crewe and Anglo-French Relations, 1924\u20131928.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 25#1 (2011): 49\u201364.</ref> The high point of cooperation came with the [[Locarno Treaties|Treaty of Locarno]] in 1925, which brought Germany into good terms with France and Britain. However, relations with France became increasingly tense because Chamberlain grew annoyed that foreign minister [[Aristide Briand]]'s diplomatic agenda did not have at its heart a reinvigorated Entente Cordiale.<ref>Gaynor Johnson,  \"Austen Chamberlain and Britain's Relations with France, 1924\u20131929.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 17.4 (2006): 753\u2013769.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Britain thought disarmament was the key to peace but France disagreed because of its profound fear of German militarism. London decided Paris really sought military dominance of Europe. Before 1933, most Britons saw France, not Germany, as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as severe an economic recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.<ref>David Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' (1977) p 716.</ref> [[Anthony Powell]], in his ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', said that to be anti-French and pro-German in the 1920s was considered the height of progressive sophistication.<ref>Andrew Roberts, '''The Holy Fox': The Life of Lord Halifax'' (London: Phoenix, 1997), p. 51.</ref>\n\n====Appeasement of Germany====\n[[File:MunichAgreement.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Both states initially pursued a policy of [[appeasement]] towards [[Nazi Germany]]. When this failed, they both declared war in September 1939 in response to the German [[invasion of Poland]].]]\n\nIn the 1930s Britain and France coordinated their policies toward the dictatorships of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany. However public opinion did not support going to war again, so the diplomats sought diplomatic solutions, but none worked. Efforts to use the League of Nations to apply sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia failed. France supported the \"[[Little Entente]]\" of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. It proved much too weak to deter Germany.<ref>William I. Shorrock, \"France, Italy, and the Eastern Mediterranean in the 1920s,\" ''International History Review'' (1986) 8#1 pp 70\u201382</ref>\n\nThe [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] was signed between Britain and [[Nazi Germany]] in 1935, allowing Hitler to reinforce his [[Kriegsmarine|navy]]. It was regarded by the French as the ruining of the anti-Hitlerian [[Stresa front]].  Britain and France collaborated closely especially in the late 1930s regarding Germany, based on informal promises with no written treaty. Efforts were made to negotiate a treaty but they failed in 1936, underscoring French weakness.<ref>{{cite book|author=J. Nere|title=The Foreign Policy of France from 1914 to 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIeyAs95X2oC&pg=PA199|year=2002|pages=198\u2013200|isbn=9780415273718}}</ref>\n\nIn the years leading up to World War II, both countries followed a similar diplomatic path of appeasement of Germany. As Nazi intentions became clear, France pushed for a harder line but the British demurred, believing diplomacy could solve the disputes. The result was the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 that gave Germany control of parts of Czechoslovakia settled by Germans. In early 1939 Germany took over all of Czechoslovakia and began threatening Poland. Appeasement had failed, and both Britain and France raced to catch up with Germany in weaponry.<ref>David Faber, ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/Munich-1938-Appeasement-World-War/dp/143913233X/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War II#Britain and France}}\n\nAfter guaranteeing the independence of Poland, both declared war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on the same day, 3 September 1939, after the Germans ignored an ultimatum to withdraw from the country. When Germany began its attack on France in 1940, British troops and French troops again fought side by side. Eventually, after the Germans came through the [[Ardennes]], it became more possible that France would not be able to fend off the German attack. The final bond between the two nations was so strong that members of the British cabinet had proposed a temporary union of the two countries for the sake of morale: the plan was drawn up by [[Jean Monnet]], who later created the [[European Economic Community|Common Market]]. The idea was not popular with a majority on either side, and the French government felt that, in the circumstances, the plan for union would reduce France to the level of a British Dominion. When London ordered the [[Dunkirk evacuation|withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force]] from France without telling French and Belgian forces<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Dunkirk-evacuation|title=Dunkirk evacuation}}</ref> and then refused to provide France with further reinforcements of aircraft<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gilbert (1983)|pages=483}}</ref> the proposal was definitively turned down. Later The [[Free French]] resistance, led by [[Charles de Gaulle]], were formed in London, after de Gaulle gave his famous '[[Appeal of 18 June]]', broadcast by the [[BBC]]. De Gaulle declared himself to be the head of the one and only true government of France, and gathered the [[Free French Forces]] around him.<ref name=\"Milton Viorst 1967\">Milton Viorst, ''Hostile allies: FDR and Charles de Gaulle'' (1967)</ref><ref name=\"David G.

It was officially neutral, but metropolitan France came increasingly under German control. The Vichy government controlled Syria, Madagascar, and French North Africa and French troops and naval forces therein. Eventually, several important French ships joined the Free French Forces.<ref name=\"in JSTOR\"/>\n\nOne by one de Gaulle took control of the French colonies, beginning with central Africa in autumn`1940, and gained recognition from Britain but not the United States. An Anglo-Free French attack on Vichy territory was repulsed at the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September 1940. Washington maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy (until October 1942) and avoided recognition of de Gaulle.<ref name=\"Milton Viorst 1967\"/><ref name=\"David G. Haglund 2007\"/> Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.<ref name=\"Milton Viorst 1967\"/><ref name=\"David G.

The first began in 1941 during the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign|campaign against Syria and the Lebanon]] assisted with Free French troops. In two months of bitter fighting the region was seized and then put under Free French control. Around the same time after the [[East African campaign (World War II)|Italian defeat in East Africa]], Vichy controlled [[French Somaliland]] subsequently became blockaded by British and Free French forces. In a bloodless invasion the colony fell in mid 1942. In May of 1942 the Vichy controlled island of [[Madagascar]] was invaded. In a [[Battle of Madagascar|seven-month campaign]] the island was seized by British Empire forces. Finally in the latter half of 1942 the British with the help of US forces took part in the successful invasion of French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Most Vichy forces switched sides afterwards to help the allied cause during the [[Tunisian Campaign]] fighting as part of the [[British First Army]].\n\n====Levant Crisis====\n{{Further|Levant Crisis}}\nFollowing [[D-Day]], relations between the two peoples were at a high, as the British were greeted as liberators and remained so till the surrender of Germany in May 1945. At the end of that month, however, French troops, with their continued occupation of Syria, had tried to quell nationalist protests there. With heavy Syrian civilian casualties reported, Churchill demanded a ceasefire. With none forthcoming, he ordered British forces into Syria from [[Jordan]]. When they reached [[Damascus]] in June, the French were then escorted and confined to their barracks at gunpoint.<ref name=\"Luce\">{{cite book|last1=Luce|first1=Henry Robinson|title=Time, Volume 45|date=1945|publisher=Time Incorporated|pages=25\u201326|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U-ELAQAAIAAJ&q=}}</ref> That became known as the Levant Crisis and almost brought Britain and France to the point of conflict.

The UK was successful in strongly advocating that France be given a zone of [[occupied Germany]]. Both states were amongst the five [[Permanent Members]] of the new [[UN Security Council]], where they commonly collaborated. However, France was bitter when the United States and Britain refused to share atomic secrets with it. An American [[Operation Vulture|operation]] to use air strikes (including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons) during the climax of the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in May 1954 was cancelled because of opposition by the British.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kowert|first=Paul |title=Groupthink or deadlock: when do leaders learn from their advisors?|edition=illustrated|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7914-5249-3|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3kUWAycjBsMC&pg=PA67 67\u201368]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3kUWAycjBsMC}}</ref><ref name=Tucker1999>{{Citation |last=Tucker|first=Spencer|title=Vietnam|edition=illustrated |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=76 |isbn=978-1-85728-922-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FEpuVkgzFJYC}}</ref> The upshot was France developed its own nuclear weapons and delivery systems.<ref>Peter K.

Despite its large pro-Soviet Communist Party, France joined the Allies. The first move was the Franco-British alliance realized in the Dunkirk Treaty in March 1947.<ref>Sean Greenwood,  \"Return to Dunkirk: The origins of the Anglo\u2010French treaty of March 1947.\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 6.4 (1983): 49\u201365.</ref>\n\n====Suez Crisis====\n{{Main|Suez Crisis|France and weapons of mass destruction}}\nIn 1956 the [[Suez Canal]], previously owned by an Anglo-French company, was nationalised by the Egyptian government.

In particular, President [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s attempts to exclude the British from European affairs during France's early [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]] are now seen by many in Britain as a betrayal of the strong bond between the countries, and [[Anthony Eden]]'s exclusion of France from the Commonwealth is seen in a similar light in France. The French partly feared that were the British to join the EEC they would attempt to dominate it.\n\nOver the years, the UK and France have often taken diverging courses within the European Community. British policy has favoured an expansion of the Community and [[free trade]] while France has advocated a closer political union and restricting membership of the Community to a core of Western European states.\n\n====De Gaulle====\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle}}\nIn 1958 with France mired in a seemingly unwinnable war in [[Algeria]], de Gaulle returned to power in France. He created the [[Fifth French Republic]], ending the post-war parliamentary system and replacing it with a strong Presidency, which became dominated by his followers\u2014the [[Gaullists]]. De Gaulle made ambitious changes to French foreign policy\u2014first ending the war in Algeria, and then withdrawing France from the [[NATO]] command structure. The latter move was primarily symbolic, but NATO headquarters moved to Brussels and French generals had a much lesser role.<ref>Philip G. Cerny, ''The Politics of Grandeur: Ideological Aspects of de Gaulle's Foreign Policy'' (1980).</ref><ref>W.W. Kulski, ''De Gaulle and the World: The Foreign Policy of the Fifth French Republic'' (1966) passim [https://archive.org/details/degaulleworld00kuls online free to borrow]</ref>\n\nFrench policy blocking British entry into the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) was primarily motivated by political rather than economic considerations. In 1967, as in 1961\u201363, de Gaulle was determined to preserve France's dominance within the EEC, which was the foundation of the nation's international stature. His policy was to preserve the Community of Six while barring Britain. Although France succeeded in excluding Britain in the short term, in the longer term the French had to adjust their stance on enlargement in order to retain influence. De Gaulle feared that letting Britain into the European Community would open the way for Anglo-Saxon (i.e., US and UK) influence to overwhelm the France-West Germany coalition that was now dominant. On 14 January 1963, de Gaulle announced that France would [[History of the European Communities (1958\u20131972)#De Gaulle and EFTA|veto Britain's entry into the Common Market.]]<ref>Helen Parr, \"Saving the Community: The French response to Britain's second EEC application in 1967.\" ''Cold War History'' 6#4 (2006): 425\u2013454.</ref>\n\n===Since 1969===\n[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy MEDEF.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (2007\u20132012) tried to establish a closer relationship with the UK,<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-monde/a-londres-pompe-royale-pour-le-couple-sarkozy/924/0/232117 \u00c0 Londres, pompe royale pour le couple Sarkozy] \u2013 Le Point</ref> than existed under his predecessors [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]].]]\nWhen de Gaulle resigned in 1969, a new French government under [[Georges Pompidou]] was prepared to open a more friendly dialogue with Britain.

[[English literature]], in particular the works of [[Agatha Christie]] and [[William Shakespeare]], has been immensely popular in France.

In turn, French writers such as [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Victor Hugo]] have been [[translation|translated]] numerous times into English.

Though rugby is originally a British sport, [[Rugby union in France|French rugby]] has developed to such an extent that the English and French teams are now stiff competitors, with neither side greatly superior to the other. While English influences spread rugby union at an early stage to Scotland, Wales and Ireland, as well as the Commonwealth realms, French influence spread the sport outside the commonwealth, to Italy, Argentina, Romania and Georgia.\n\nThe influence of French players and coaches on British football has been increasing in recent years and is often cited as an example of Anglo-French cooperation. In particular the [[Premier League]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] has become known for its Anglo-French connection due to a heavy influx of French players since the advent of French manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] in 1996.

The historical ties between France and the UK, and the countries preceding them, are long and complex, including conquest, [[Anglo-French War (disambiguation)|wars]], and [[Anglo-French alliance (disambiguation)|alliances]] at various points in history. The [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] saw both areas, except [[Northern England]] and [[Scotland]], conquered by Rome, whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day, and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas; however, the language barrier remained. The [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 decisively shaped English history, as well as the English language. In the [[Middle Ages]], the countries were often bitter enemies, with both nations' monarchs [[English claims to the French throne|claiming control over France]]. Some of the noteworthy conflicts include the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] which were French victories, as well as the [[Seven Years' War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], from which Great Britain emerged victorious.\n\nThe last major conflict between the two were the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in which coalitions of European powers, financed and usually led by the United Kingdom fought a series of wars against the [[First French Empire]] and its client states, culminating in the defeat of [[Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815. There were some subsequent tensions, especially after 1880, over such issues as the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Scramble for Africa|rivalry for African colonies]]. Despite some brief war scares, peace always prevailed. Friendly ties between the two began with the 1904 [[Entente Cordiale]], and the British and French were allied against Germany in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]; in the latter conflict, British armies helped to [[Free France#Liberation of France|liberate]] [[occupied France]] from the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. Both nations opposed the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]] and were founding members of [[NATO]], the Western military alliance led by the United States. During the 1960s, French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] distrusted the British for being [[Special Relationship|too close to the Americans]], and for years he blocked British entry into the European common market, now called the [[European Union]]. De Gaulle also pulled France out of its active role in NATO because that alliance was too heavily dominated by Washington. After his death, Britain did enter the European Union, and France returned to NATO.\n\nIn recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship, especially on defence and foreign policy issues; the two countries tend, however, to disagree on a range of other matters, most notably the [[European Union]].<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2011/12/britain-and-france Britain and France: the impossible, indispensable relationship ], ''[[The Economist]]'', 1 Dec 2011</ref> France and Britain are often still referred to as \"historic rivals\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/05/british-and-french-economies-same-problem Economies of Britain and France have more similarities than differences], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 January 2014</ref> or with emphasis on the perceived ever-lasting competition that still opposes the two countries.<ref>\"The two countries are forever comparing one against the other.[...]\", [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25959465 Britain-France ties: How cordial is the entente?], [[BBC News]], 30 January 2014</ref> French author Jos\u00e9-Alain Fralon characterised the relationship between the countries by describing the British as \"our most dear enemies\".\n\nUnlike France, the United Kingdom left the [[European Union]] in 2020, after it voted to do so in a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]] held on 23 June 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887|title=The UK's EU referendum: All you need to know \u2013 BBC News|access-date=2016-06-25}}</ref> It is estimated that about 350,000 French people [[French migration to the United Kingdom|live in the UK]], with approximately 400,000 Britons [[British migration to France|living in France]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/pays-zones-geo_833/royaume-uni_202/index.html Royaume-Uni] \u2013 France Diplomacie</ref>\n\n==Country comparison==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

As a consequence, Caesar felt compelled to invade in an attempt to subdue Britain. Rome was reasonably successful at conquering Gaul and Britain and Belgica all; and all three areas became provinces of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nFor the next five hundred years, there was much interaction between the two regions, as both Britain and France were under Roman rule. After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], this was followed by another five hundred years with very little interaction between the two, as both were invaded by different [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes. [[Anglo-Saxon]]ism rose from a mixture of Brythonism and [[Scandinavia]]n immigration in Britain to conquer the Picts and Gaels. France saw intermixture with and partial conquest by [[Germanic tribes]] such as the [[Salian Franks]] to create the [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdoms. [[Christianity]] as a religion spread through all areas involved during this period, replacing the Germanic, Celtic and pre-Celtic forms of worship. The deeds of chieftains in this period would produce the legendaria around [[King Arthur]] and [[Camelot]] \u2013 now believed to be a legend based on the deeds of many early medieval British chieftains \u2013 and the more historically verifiable [[Charlemagne]], the Frankish chieftain who founded the [[Holy Roman Empire]] throughout much of Western Europe. At the turn of the second millennium, the [[British Isles]] were primarily involved with the [[Scandinavia]]n world, while France's main foreign relationship was with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Christopher A. Snyder, ''The Britons'' (2003) (Author</ref>\n\n===Before the Conquest===\nPrior to the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, there were no armed conflicts between the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of France]]. France and England were subject to repeated [[Viking invasions]], and their foreign preoccupations were primarily directed toward Scandinavia.\n\nSuch cross-Channel relations as England had were directed toward Normandy, a quasi-independent fief owing homage to the French king; [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], daughter of Normandy's Duke [[Richard I, Duke of Normandy|Richard]], became queen to two English kings in succession; two of her sons, [[Harthacnut]] and [[Edward the Confessor]] later became kings of England. Edward spent much of his early life (1013\u20131041) in Normandy and, as king, favored certain Normans with high office, such as [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]], who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].\n\nThis gradual Normanization of the realm set the stage for the Norman Conquest, in which Emma's brother's grandson, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of Normandy, gained the kingdom in the first successful cross-Channel invasion since Roman times. Together with its new ruler, England acquired the foreign policy of the Norman dukes, which was based on protecting and expanding Norman interests at the expense of the French Kings. Although William's rule over Normandy had initially had the backing of King [[Henry I of France]], William's success had soon created hostility, and in 1054 and 1057 King Henry had twice attacked Normandy.\n\n===Norman conquest===\nHowever, in the mid-eleventh century there was a dispute over the English throne, and the French-speaking [[Normans]], who were of Viking stock, invaded England under their duke [[William the Conqueror]] and took over following the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, and crowned themselves [[Kings of England]]. The Normans took control of the land and the political system. [[Feudal culture]] took root in England, and for the next 150 years England was generally considered of secondary importance to the dynasty's Continental territories, notably in Normandy and other western French provinces. The language of the [[aristocracy]] was French for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest. Many French words were adopted into the English language as a result. About [[List of English words of French origin|one third of the English language]] is derived from or through various forms of French. The first Norman kings were also the [[Duke of Normandy|Dukes of Normandy]], so relations were somewhat complicated between the countries. Though they were dukes ostensibly under the king of France, their higher level of organisation in Normandy gave them more de facto power. In addition, they were kings of England in their own right; England was not officially a province of France, nor a province of Normandy.<ref>Richard Huscroft, ''The Norman Conquest: A New Introduction'' (2009).</ref>\n\n===Breton War, 1076\u20131077===\nThis war was fought between the years 1076 to 1077.<ref>George Beech, ''Was the Bayeux Tapestry Made in France?'' (2005) pp. 19\u201331.</ref>\n\n===Vexin War, 1087===\nIn 1087, following the monastic retirement of its last count, William and Philip partitioned between themselves the [[Vexin]], a small but strategically important county on the middle [[Seine]] that controlled the traffic between [[Paris]] and [[Rouen]], the French and Norman capitals. With this buffer state eliminated, Normandy and the king's royal demesne (the [[\u00cele-de-France]]) now directly bordered on each other, and the region would be the flashpoint for several future wars. In 1087, William responded to border raids conducted by Philip's soldiers by attacking the town of [[Mantes]], during the sack of which he received an accidental injury that turned fatal.\n\n===Rebellion of 1088===\n{{main|Rebellion of 1088}}\nWith William's death, his realms were parted between his two sons (England to [[William II of England|William Rufus]], Normandy to [[Robert Curthose]]) and the Norman-French border war concluded. Factional strains between the Norman barons, faced with a double loyalty to William's two sons, created a brief civil war in which an attempt was made to force Rufus off the English throne. With the failure of the rebellion, England and Normandy were clearly divided for the first time since 1066.\n\n===Wars in the Vexin and Maine, 1097\u20131098===\nRobert Curthose left on crusade in 1096, and for the duration of his absence Rufus took over the administration of Normandy. Soon afterwards (1097) he attacked the Vexin and the next year the [[County of Maine]]. Rufus succeeded in defeating Maine, but the war in the Vexin ended inconclusively with a truce in 1098.<ref>Frank Barlow, ''William Rufus'' (Yale UP, 2000).</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Norman War, 1101===\nIn August 1100, William Rufus was killed by an arrow shot while hunting. His younger brother, [[Henry I of England|Henry Beauclerc]] immediately took the throne. It had been expected to go to Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, but Robert was away on a crusade and did not return until a month after Rufus' death, by which time Henry was firmly in control of England, and his accession had been recognized by France's [[Philip I of France|King Philip]]. Robert was, however, able to reassert his control over Normandy, though only after giving up the County of Maine.\n\nEngland and Normandy were now in the hands of the two brothers, Henry and Robert. In July 1101, Robert launched an attack on England from Normandy. He landed successfully at Portsmouth, and advanced inland to [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]] in Hampshire. There he and Henry came to an [[Treaty of Alton|agreement]] to accept the ''status quo'' of the territorial division. Henry was freed from his homage to Robert, and agreed to pay the Duke an annual sum (which, however, he only paid until 1103).<ref>C. Warren Hollister, \"The strange death of William Rufus.\" ''Speculum'' 48.4 (1973): 637\u2013653.</ref>\n\n===Anglo-Norman War, 1105\u20131106===\nFollowing increasing tensions between the brothers, and evidence of the weakness of Robert's rule, Henry I invaded Normandy in the spring of 1105, landing at Barfleur. The ensuing Anglo-Norman war was longer and more destructive, involving sieges of [[Bayeux]] and [[Caen]]; but Henry had to return to England in the late summer, and it was not until the following summer that he was able to resume the conquest of Normandy. In the interim, Duke Robert took the opportunity to appeal to his liege lord, King Philip, but could obtain no aid from him. The fate of Robert and the duchy was sealed at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]] on 28 or 29 September 1106: Robert was captured and imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry was now, like his father, both King of England and Duke of Normandy, and the stage was set for a new round of conflict between England and France.\n\n===Anglo-French War, 1117\u20131120===\nIn 1108, Philip I, who had been king of France since before the Norman Conquest, died and was succeeded by his son [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]], who had already been conducting the administration of the realm in his father's name for several years.\n\nLouis had initially been hostile to Robert Curthose, and friendly to Henry I; but with Henry's acquisition of Normandy, the old Norman-French rivalries re-emerged. From 1109 to 1113, clashes erupted in the Vexin; and in 1117 Louis made a pact with [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]], [[Fulk V of Anjou]], and various rebellious Norman barons to overthrow Henry's rule in Normandy and replace him with [[William Clito]], Curthose's son. By luck and diplomacy, however, Henry eliminated the Flemings and Angevins from the war, and on 20 August 1119 at the [[Battle of Bremule]] he defeated the French. Louis was obliged to accept Henry's rule in Normandy, and accepted his son [[William Adelin]]'s homage for the fief in 1120.\n\n===High medieval era===\n{{further|Anglo-French war of 1202\u201314|First Barons' War|Saintonge War|War of Saint-Sardos}}\n[[File:BeaulieuAbbey5.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Beaulieu Abbey]], founded by [[King John of England]] for [[Cistercians]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newforestexplorersguide.co.uk/sitefolders/villages/beaulieu/historyintro/beaulieuhistorypage.html | title=New Forest Heritage}}</ref> a religious order from France who gave the Abbey its present name, French for \"beautiful place\"]]\n\nDuring the reign of the closely related [[Plantagenet]] dynasty, which was based in its [[Angevin Empire]], half of France was under Angevin control as well as all of England. However, almost all of the Angevin empire was lost to [[Philip II of France]] under [[Richard the Lionheart]], John and Henry III of England. This finally gave the English a separate identity as an Anglo-Saxon people under a Francophone, but not French, crown.<ref>Dan Jones and Clive Chafer, ''The Plantagenets: The Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England'' (2013).</ref>\n\nWhile the English and French had been frequently acrimonious, they had always had a common culture and little fundamental difference in identity. Nationalism had been minimal in days when most wars took place between rival feudal lords on a sub-national scale. The last attempt to unite the two cultures under such lines was probably a failed French-supported rebellion to depose Edward II. It was also during the Middle Ages that a Franco-Scottish alliance, known as the [[Auld Alliance]] was signed by King [[John of Scotland]] and [[Philip IV of France]].<ref>Maurice Powicke, ''The Thirteenth Century, 1216\u20131307'' (Oxford History of England, 1962).</ref>\n\n===The Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main|The Hundred Years' War}}\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|right|210px|During the [[Hundred Years' War]] England and France battled for supremacy. Following the [[Battle of Agincourt]] the English gained control of vast French territory, but were eventually driven out. English monarchs would still claim the throne of France until 1800.]]\nThe English monarchy increasingly integrated with its subjects and turned to the English language wholeheartedly during the [[Hundred Years' War]] between 1337 and 1453. Though the war was in principle a mere dispute over territory, it drastically changed societies on both sides of the Channel. The English, although already politically united, for the first time found pride in their language and identity, while the French united politically.<ref>David Green, ''The Hundred Years War: A People's History'' (2014),</ref><ref>E.

[[Bertrand du Guesclin]] was a brilliant tactician who forced the English out of the lands they had procured at the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]], a compromising treaty that most Frenchmen saw as a humiliation. [[Joan of Arc]] was another unifying figure who to this day represents a combination of religious fervour and French patriotism to all France. After her inspirational victory at Orl\u00e9ans and what many saw as Joan's martyrdom at the hands of Burgundians and Englishmen, [[Jean de Dunois]] eventually forced the English out of all of France except [[Calais]], which was only lost in 1558. Apart from setting national identities, the Hundred Years' War was the root of the traditional rivalry and at times hatred between the two countries. During this era, the English lost their last territories in France, except Calais, which would remain in English hands for another 105 years, though the English monarchs continued to style themselves as Kings of France until 1800.<ref>May McKisack, ''The Fourteenth Century, 1307\u20131399'' (Oxford History of England, 1959).</ref>\n\n===The Franco-Scots Alliance===\n{{Main|Auld Alliance}}\n\nFrance and [[Scotland]] agreed to defend each other in the event of an attack on either from England in several [[treaty|treaties]], the most notable of which were in 1327 and 1490. There had always been intermarriage between the Scottish and French royal households, but this solidified the bond between the royals even further.<ref>Norman Macdougall, ''An Antidote to the English: The Auld Alliance, 1295\u20131560'' (2001)</ref>\nScottish historian [[J.

They took opposite sides in all of the [[Italian Wars]] between 1494 and 1559.\n\nAn even deeper division set in during the [[English Reformation]], when most of England converted to Protestantism and France remained Roman Catholic. This enabled each side to see the other as not only a foreign evil but also a heretical one. In both countries there was intense civil religious conflict. Because of the oppression by Roman Catholic King [[Louis XIII of France]], many Protestant [[Huguenots]] fled to England. Similarly, many Catholics fled from England to France.  Scotland had a very close relationship with France in the 16th century, with intermarriage at the highest level.\n\n[[Henry VIII of England]] had initially sought an alliance with France, and the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] saw a face to face meeting between him and King [[Francis I of France]].  [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (1542\u20131587) Was born to King [[James V]] and his French second wife, [[Mary of Guise]] and became Queen when her father was killed in the wars with England. Her mother became Regent, brought in French advisors, and ruled Scotland in the French style. David Ditchburn and Alastair MacDonald argue:\n:Protestantism was, however, given an enormous boost in Scotland, especially among the governing classes, by the suffocating political embrace of Catholic France. The threat to Scotland's independence seem to come most potently from France, not England... And absorption by France was not a future that appealed to Scots.<ref>David Ditchburn and Alastair MacDonald, \"Medieval Scotland: 1100\u20131560,\" in R.A.

Key to English strategy was the fear that a [[universal monarchy]] of Europe would be able to overwhelm the [[British Isles]].<ref>Simms p.11-25</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the English Civil War, the newly formed Republic under Oliver Cromwell, \"the Commonwealth of England\" joined sides with the French against Spain during the last decade of the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659). The English were particularly interested in the troublesome city of Dunkirk and in accordance with the alliance the city was given to the English after the Battle of the Dunes (1658), but after the monarchy was restored in England, Charles II sold it back to the French in 1662 for \u00a3320,000. \n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Thirty Years War (1618\u20131648)[[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, and as France finally overcame its rebellious \"princes of the blood\" and Protestant Huguenots, the long fought wars of the Fronde (civil wars) finally came to an end. At the same time Spain's power was severely weakened by decades of wars and rebellions \u2013 and France, began to take on a more assertive role under King [[Louis XIV of France]] with an expansionist policy both in Europe and across the globe. English foreign policy was now directed towards preventing France gaining supremacy on the continent and creating a universal monarchy. To the French, England was an isolated and piratical nation heavily reliant on naval power, and particularly [[privateers]], which they referred to as [[Perfidious Albion]].\n\nHowever, in 1672, the English again formed an alliance with the French (in accordance with the Secret Treaty of Dover of 1670) against their common commercial rival, the rich Dutch Republic \u2013 the two nations fighting side by side during the Franco-Dutch War (1672\u20131678) and Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672\u20131674). This war was extremely unpopular in England. The English had been soundly beaten at sea by the Dutch and were in a worsening financial situation as their vulnerable global trade was under increasing threat. The English pulled out of the alliance in 1674, ending their war with the Netherlands and actually joining them against the French in the final year of the Franco-Dutch War in 1678.\n\nDuring the course of the century a sharp diversion in political philosophies emerged in the two states. In England King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had been executed during the [[English Civil War]] for exceeding his powers, and later King [[James II of England|James II]] had been overthrown in the [[Glorious Revolution]]. In France, the decades long Fronde (civil wars), had seen the French Monarchy triumphant and as a result the power of the monarchs and their advisors became almost absolute and went largely unchecked.\n\n[[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] fought each other in the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]] from 1688 to 1697 which set the pattern for relations between France and Great Britain during the eighteenth century. Wars were fought intermittently, with each nation part of a constantly shifting pattern of alliances known as the [[stately quadrille]].\n\n===Second Hundred Years' War 1689\u20131815===\n{{Main|Second Hundred Years' War|International relations, 1648\u20131814}}\n\n====18th century====\n[[File:Union flag 1606 (Kings Colors).svg|thumb|right|160px|The [[Act of Union (1707)|Act of Union]] was passed in 1707 partly to unify Great Britain against the perceived French threat.]]\n\nPartly out of fear of a continental intervention, an Act of Union was passed in 1707 creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], and formally merging the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] (the latter kingdom included [[Wales]]).<ref>Simms p.51-3</ref> While the new Britain grew increasingly [[Parliament of Great Britain|parliamentarian]], France continued its system of [[absolute monarchy]].<ref>J.

The British had a massive navy but maintained a small land army, so Britain always acted on the continent in alliance with other states such as [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] as they were unable to fight France alone. Equally France, lacking a superior navy, was unable to launch a successful invasion of Britain.<ref>James Falkner, ''The War of the Spanish Succession 1701\u20131714'' (2015).</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|left|The [[War of the Austrian Succession]] was one of several wars in which states tried to maintain the European [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].]] France lent support to the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] pretenders who claimed the British throne, hoping that a restored Jacobite monarchy would be inclined to be more pro-French.

The main powers had exhausted themselves in warfare, with many deaths, disabled veterans, ruined navies, high pension costs, heavy loans and high taxes. Utrecht strengthened the sense of useful international law and inaugurated an era of relative stability in the European state system, based on balance-of-power politics that no one country would become dominant.<ref>Dale Miquelon, \"Envisioning the French Empire: Utrecht, 1711\u20131713.\" ''French Historical Studies'' 24.4 (2001): 653\u2013677.</ref> [[Robert Walpole]], the key British policy maker, prioritized peace in Europe because it was good for his trading nation and its growing [[British Empire]]. British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n:That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large, \u2014 the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.<ref>G.M. Trevelyan, ''A Shortened History of England'' (1942) p 363.</ref>\nBut \"balance\" needed armed enforcement. Britain played a key military role as \"balancer.\" The goals were to bolster Europe's balance of power system to maintain peace that was needed for British trade to flourish and its colonies to grow, and finally to strengthen its own central position in the balance of power system in which no one could dominate the rest.  Other nations recognized Britain as the \"balancer.\"  Eventually the balancing act required Britain to contain French ambitions. Containment led to a series of increasingly large-scale wars between Britain and France, which ended with mixed results. Britain was usually aligned with the Netherlands and Prussia, and subsidised their armies. These wars enveloped all of Europe and the overseas colonies. These wars took place in every decade starting in the 1740s and climaxed in the defeat of Napoleon's France in 1814.<ref>Michael Sheehan, \"Balance of power intervention: Britain's decisions for or against war, 1733\u201356.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 7.2 (1996): 271\u2013289. {{doi|10.1080/09592299608406004}}</ref>\n\nAs the century wore on, there was a distinct passage of power to Britain and France, at the expense of traditional major powers such as Portugal, Spain and the [[Dutch Republic]]. Some observers saw the frequent conflicts between the two states during the 18th century as a battle for control of Europe, though most of these wars ended without a conclusive victory for either side. France largely had greater influence on the continent while Britain were dominant at sea and trade, threatening French colonies abroad.<ref>D. B Horn, ''Great Britain and Europe in the eighteenth century'' (1967) pp 22\u201385.</ref>\n\n====Overseas expansion====\n{{Further2|[[First British Empire]] and [[French colonial empire|French Empire]]}}\nFrom the 1650s, the [[New World]] increasingly became a battleground between the two powers.

Both nations coveted the [[Ohio Country]] and in 1753 a British expedition there led by [[George Washington]] clashed with a French force. Shortly afterwards the [[French and Indian War]] broke out, initially taking place only in North America but in 1756 becoming part of the wider [[Seven Years' War]] in which Britain and France were part of opposing coalitions.\n\nThe war has been called the first \"[[world war]]\", because fighting took place on several different continents.<ref>Tom Pocock, ''Battle for Empire: The Very First World War, 1756\u201363'' (London: Michael O'Mara Books, 1998)</ref> In 1759 the British enjoyed victories over the French in Europe, Canada and India, severely weakening the French position around the world.<ref>1759: The Year Britain Became Master of the World.

They were supported by [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] and by the [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], Minister for War and for the Navy.  In 1763, [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Louis Bougainville]] sailed from France with two ships, several families, cattle, horses and grain. He established the first colony in the [[Falkland Islands]] at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Saint Louis]] in February 1764. This done, Bougainville's plan was to use the new settlement as a French base from where he could mount a search for the long-imagined (but still undiscovered) [[Terra Australis|Southern Continent]] and claim it for France.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hodson |first1=Christopher |title=The Acadian Diaspora |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199739776}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary of the [[Admiralty]], [[Sir Philip Stephens, 1st Baronet|Philip Stephens]], swiftly and secretly dispatched [[John Byron]] to the Falklands and round the world. He was followed in 1766 by [[Samuel Wallis]] who discovered [[Tahiti]] and claimed it for Britain. Bougainville followed and claimed Tahiti for France in 1768, but when he tried to reach the east coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (Australia), he was thwarted by the [[Great Barrier Reef]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=24\u201355}}</ref>\n\nThe Admiralty sent [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] to the Pacific on three voyages of discovery in 1768, 1772 and 1776. Cook was killed in [[Hawaii]] in 1779 and his two ships, ''Resolution'' and ''Discovery'', arrived home in October 1780.\n\nAt the same time, more Frenchmen were probing the South Seas. In 1769, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Marie de Surville|Jean Surville]] sailed from India, through the [[Coral Sea]] to New Zealand then traversed the Pacific to [[Peru]]. In 1771, [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne|Marion Dufresne]] and Julien\u2013Marie Crozet sailed through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Later in 1771, another French expedition under [[Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec|Yves de Kerguelen]] and [[Louis Aleno de St Alo\u00fcarn|Louis St Alo\u00fcarn]] explored the southern Indian Ocean. St Alo\u00fcarn annexed the west coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] for France in March 1772.\n\nIn August 1785, [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] sent [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lap\u00e9rouse]] to explore the Pacific Ocean. He arrived off [[Sydney Heads]] in January 1788, three days after the arrival of Britain's [[First Fleet]] commanded by [[Arthur Phillip]]. The French expedition departed Australia three months later in March 1788 and, according to the records, was never seen again.\n\nThe race for territory in the South Seas continued into the nineteenth century. Although the British had settled the eastern region of New Holland, in 1800 [[Napoleon]] dispatched an expedition commanded by [[Nicolas Baudin]] to forestall the British on the south and west coasts of the continent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fornasiero |first1=West-Sooby, Peron |title=French Designs on Colonial New South Wales |date=2014 |publisher=Friends of the State Library of South Australia Inc. |location=Adelaide |isbn=9781876154721}}</ref>\n\n====American War of Independence====\n{{Main|France in the American Revolution}}\nAs American Patriot dissatisfaction with British policies grew to rebellion in 1774-75, the French saw an opportunity to undermine British power.

Plans were drawn up, but never put into action, to launch an invasion of England. The threat forced Britain to keep many troops in Britain that were needed in America. The British were further required to withdraw forces from the American mainland to protect their more valuable possessions in the West Indies. While the French were initially unable to break the string of British victories, the combined actions of American and French forces, and a key victory by a French fleet over a British rescue fleet, forced the British into a decisive surrender at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown, Virginia]], in 1781.<ref>William C.

While France was plunged into chaos, Britain took advantage of its temporary weakness to stir up the [[War in the Vend\u00e9e|civil war occurring in France]] and build up its naval forces. The Revolution was initially popular with many Britons, both because it appeared to weaken France and was perceived to be based on British liberal ideals. This began to change as the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] faction took over, and began the [[Reign of Terror]] (or simply the Terror, for short).<ref>Jeremy Black, ''British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783\u20131793'' (1994) ch 9</ref>\n\nThe French were intent on spreading their [[revolutionary republicanism]] to other European states, including Britain. The British initially stayed out of the alliances of European states which unsuccessfully attacked France trying to restore the monarchy. In France a new, strong nationalism took hold enabling them to mobilise large and motivated forces. Following the execution of King [[Louis XVI of France]] in 1793, France declared war on Britain. This period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] was known as the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Except for a brief pause in 1802\u201303, the wars lasted continuously for 21 years. During this time Britain raised several coalitions against the French, continually subsidising other European states with the [[Golden Cavalry of St George]], enabling them to put large armies in the field. In spite of this, the French armies were very successful on land, creating several client states such as the [[Batavian Republic]], and the British devoted much of their own forces to campaigns against the French in the Caribbean, with mixed results.<ref>Steven T.

This period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] was known as the [[War of the First Coalition]], which lasted from 1792 to 1797.\n\nThe British policy was to give financial and diplomatic support continental allies, who did nearly all of the actual fighting on land. France meanwhile set up the conscription system that built up a much larger army than anyone else. After the king was executed, nearly all the senior officers went into exile, and a very young new generation of officers, typified by Napoleon, took over the French military. Britain relied heavily on the Royal Navy, which sank the French fleet at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798, trapping the French army in Egypt. In 1799, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] came to power in France, and created a dictatorship. Britain led the [[Second Coalition]] from 1798 to 1802 against Napoleon, but he generally prevailed. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of 1802 was favorable to France. That treaty amounted to a year-long truce in the war, which was reopened by Britain in May 1803.\n\n[[File:Maniac-Ravings-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|330px|left|\"Maniac-raving's-or-Little Boney in a strong fit\" by [[James Gillray]].

The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Kagan<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007)</ref> argues that Britain was insulted and alarmed especially by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Britons felt insulted when Napoleon said it deserved no voice in European affairs (even though King George was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire), and ought to shut down the London newspapers that were vilifying Napoleon. Russia, furthermore, decided that the Switzerland intervention indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution.<ref>Frederick Kagan, ''The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801\u20131805'' (2007) pp 42\u201343</ref> Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses \u2013 an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\" However, in the end it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to British national interest. Furthermore, Napoleon was not ready for war and this was the best time for Britain to stop them.<ref>McLynn, ''Napoleon: A Biography'' (1997) p. 69</ref> Britain therefore seized upon the Malta issue (by refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island).\n\nThe deeper British grievances were that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines.<ref>John D.

That plan collapsed after the annihilation of the Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar, coinciding with an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] attack over its [[Bavaria]]n allies.\n\nIn response Napoleon established a [[continental system]] by which no nation was permitted to trade with the British. Napoleon hoped the embargo would isolate the [[British Isles]] severely weakening them, but a number of countries continued to trade with them in defiance of the policy. In spite of this, the Napoleonic influence stretched across much of Europe.\n\nIn 1808 French forces invaded Portugal trying to attempt to halt trade with Britain, turning Spain into a [[satellite state]] in the process.<ref>Esdaile p.1-36</ref> The British responded by dispatching a force under [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]] which captured Lisbon.<ref>Esdaile p.87-108</ref> Napoleon dispatched increasing forces into the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which became the key battleground between the two nations. Allied with Spanish and Portuguese forces, the British inflicted a number of defeats on the French, confronted with a new kind of warfare called \"[[guerrilla]]\" which led Napoleon to brand it the \"Spanish Ulcer\".\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon's invasion of Russia caused a new coalition to form against him, in what became the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]].In 1813, British forces defeated French forces in Spain and caused them to retreat into France. Allied to an increasingly resurgent European coalition, the British invaded southern France in October 1813, forcing Napoleon to abdicate and go into exile on [[Elba]] in 1814.<ref>Esdaile p503-6</ref>\n\n[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Allied victory at Waterloo in 1815 marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Era]].

With strong British support, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy was restored and [[Louis XVIII]] was crowned King of France. The [[Napoleonic era]] was the last occasion on which Britain and France went to war with each other, but by no means marked the end of the rivalry between the two nations.   [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]] shaped British foreign policy as foreign minister 1812\u20131822; he led the moves against Napoleon 1812 and 1815.

The British developed India and Canada and colonized Australia, spreading their powers to several different continents as the [[Second British Empire]]. Likewise the French were quite active in Southeast Asia and Africa.\n\nThey frequently made stereotypical jokes about each other, and even side by side in war were critical of each other's tactics. As a Royal Navy officer said to the French [[French corsairs|corsair]] [[Robert Surcouf]] \"You French fight for money, while we British fight for honour.\", [[Robert Surcouf|Surcouf]] replied \"Sir, a man fights for what he lacks the most.\" According to one story, a French diplomat once said to Lord Palmerston \"If I were not a Frenchman, I should wish to be an Englishman\"; to which Palmerston replied: \"If I were not an Englishman, I should wish to be an Englishman.\"<ref>[[William Ewart Gladstone]] recounting the conversation to [[Lord Rendel]] in 1889, from F.

The major European powers\u2014[[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], Britain, and to some extent [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]\u2014were determined to keep France in check, and so France generally pursued a cautious foreign policy. Louis-Phillipe allied with Britain, the country with which France shared the most similar form of government, and its combative Foreign Secretary [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. In Louis-Philippe's first year in power, he refused to annex Belgium during [[Belgian Revolution|its revolution]], instead following the British line of supporting independence. Despite posturings from leading French minister [[Adolphe Thiers]] in 1839\u20131840 that France would protect the increasingly powerful [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] (a viceroy of the [[Ottoman Empire]]), any reinforcements were not forthcoming, and in 1840, much to France's embarrassment, Ali was forced to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] by the powers. Relations cooled again under the governments of [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] and [[Robert Peel]]. They soured once more in 1846 though when, with Palmerston back as Foreign Secretary, the French government hastily agreed to have [[Isabella II of Spain]] and her sister marry members of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and Orl\u00e9anist dynasties, respectively.

However [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] was elected president of France in 1848 and made himself Emperor Napoleon III in 1851. Napoleon III had an expansionist foreign policy, which saw the French deepen the [[colonisation of Africa]] and establish new colonies, in particular [[Indochina]]. The British were initially alarmed, and commissioned a series of forts in southern England designed to resist a French invasion. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] as foreign minister and prime minister had close personal ties with leading French statesmen, notably Napoleon III himself. Palmerston's goal was to arrange peaceful relations with France in order to free Britain's diplomatic hand elsewhere in the world.<ref>David Brown, \"Palmerston and Anglo\u2013French Relations, 1846\u20131865,\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' (2006) 17#4 pp 675\u2013692.</ref> Napoleon at first had a pro-British foreign policy, and was eager not to displease the British government whose friendship he saw as important to France. After a brief threat of an invasion of Britain in 1851, France and Britain cooperated in the 1850s, with an alliance in the Crimean War, and a major trade treaty in 1860.  The [[Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty]] Of 1860 lowered tariffs in each direction, and began the British practice of encouraging lower tariffs across Europe, and using most favored nation treaties. However Britain viewed the Second Empire with increasing distrust, especially as the emperor built up his navy, expanded his empire and took up a more active foreign policy.<ref>Jonathan Philip Parry, \"The impact of Napoleon III on British politics, 1851\u20131880.\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (Sixth Series)'' 11 (2001): 147\u2013175.

The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] split the Middle East between the two states, in the form of [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]]. However the outlook of the nations were different during the inter-war years; while France saw itself inherently as a European power, Britain enjoyed close relationships with Australia, Canada and New Zealand and supported the idea of imperial free trade, a form of protectionism that would have seen large tariffs placed on goods from France.\n\nIn the 1920s, financial instability was a major problem for France, and other nations as well. it was vulnerable to short-term concerted action by banks and financial institutions by heavy selling or buying, in the financial crisis could weaken governments, and be used as a diplomatic threat. Premier and Finance Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] decided to stabilise the franc to protect against political currency manipulation by Germany and Britain. His solution in 1926 was a return to a fixed parity against gold. France was not able to turn the tables and use short-term financial advantage as leverage against Britain on important policy matters.<ref>John Keiger, \"Wielding Finance as a Weapon of Diplomacy: France and Britain in the 1920s,\" ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#1 pp 29\u201347</ref>\n\nin general, France and Britain were aligned in their position on major issues. A key reason was the Francophile position of Foreign Minister [[Austen Chamberlain]], and the ambassador to Paris [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|the Marquess of Crewe]] (1922\u201328). They promoted a pro-French policy regarding French security and disarmament policy, the later stages of the Ruhr crisis, the implementation of the Geneva Protocol, the Treaty of Locarno and the origins of the Kellogg-Briand Pact.<ref>Gaynor Johnson, \"Sir Austen Chamberlain, the Marquess of Crewe and Anglo-French Relations, 1924\u20131928.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 25#1 (2011): 49\u201364.</ref> The high point of cooperation came with the [[Locarno Treaties|Treaty of Locarno]] in 1925, which brought Germany into good terms with France and Britain. However, relations with France became increasingly tense because Chamberlain grew annoyed that foreign minister [[Aristide Briand]]'s diplomatic agenda did not have at its heart a reinvigorated Entente Cordiale.<ref>Gaynor Johnson,  \"Austen Chamberlain and Britain's Relations with France, 1924\u20131929.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 17.4 (2006): 753\u2013769.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Britain thought disarmament was the key to peace but France disagreed because of its profound fear of German militarism. London decided Paris really sought military dominance of Europe. Before 1933, most Britons saw France, not Germany, as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as severe an economic recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.<ref>David Marquand, ''Ramsay MacDonald'' (1977) p 716.</ref> [[Anthony Powell]], in his ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', said that to be anti-French and pro-German in the 1920s was considered the height of progressive sophistication.<ref>Andrew Roberts, '''The Holy Fox': The Life of Lord Halifax'' (London: Phoenix, 1997), p. 51.</ref>\n\n====Appeasement of Germany====\n[[File:MunichAgreement.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Both states initially pursued a policy of [[appeasement]] towards [[Nazi Germany]].

However public opinion did not support going to war again, so the diplomats sought diplomatic solutions, but none worked. Efforts to use the League of Nations to apply sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia failed. France supported the \"[[Little Entente]]\" of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. It proved much too weak to deter Germany.<ref>William I.

As Nazi intentions became clear, France pushed for a harder line but the British demurred, believing diplomacy could solve the disputes. The result was the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938 that gave Germany control of parts of Czechoslovakia settled by Germans. In early 1939 Germany took over all of Czechoslovakia and began threatening Poland. Appeasement had failed, and both Britain and France raced to catch up with Germany in weaponry.<ref>David Faber, ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/Munich-1938-Appeasement-World-War/dp/143913233X/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War II#Britain and France}}\n\nAfter guaranteeing the independence of Poland, both declared war on [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on the same day, 3 September 1939, after the Germans ignored an ultimatum to withdraw from the country. When Germany began its attack on France in 1940, British troops and French troops again fought side by side. Eventually, after the Germans came through the [[Ardennes]], it became more possible that France would not be able to fend off the German attack. The final bond between the two nations was so strong that members of the British cabinet had proposed a temporary union of the two countries for the sake of morale: the plan was drawn up by [[Jean Monnet]], who later created the [[European Economic Community|Common Market]]. The idea was not popular with a majority on either side, and the French government felt that, in the circumstances, the plan for union would reduce France to the level of a British Dominion. When London ordered the [[Dunkirk evacuation|withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force]] from France without telling French and Belgian forces<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Dunkirk-evacuation|title=Dunkirk evacuation}}</ref> and then refused to provide France with further reinforcements of aircraft<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gilbert (1983)|pages=483}}</ref> the proposal was definitively turned down. Later The [[Free French]] resistance, led by [[Charles de Gaulle]], were formed in London, after de Gaulle gave his famous '[[Appeal of 18 June]]', broadcast by the [[BBC]]. De Gaulle declared himself to be the head of the one and only true government of France, and gathered the [[Free French Forces]] around him.<ref name=\"Milton Viorst 1967\">Milton Viorst, ''Hostile allies: FDR and Charles de Gaulle'' (1967)</ref><ref name=\"David G.

It was officially neutral, but metropolitan France came increasingly under German control. The Vichy government controlled Syria, Madagascar, and French North Africa and French troops and naval forces therein. Eventually, several important French ships joined the Free French Forces.<ref name=\"in JSTOR\"/>\n\nOne by one de Gaulle took control of the French colonies, beginning with central Africa in autumn`1940, and gained recognition from Britain but not the United States. An Anglo-Free French attack on Vichy territory was repulsed at the [[Battle of Dakar]] in September 1940. Washington maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy (until October 1942) and avoided recognition of de Gaulle.<ref name=\"Milton Viorst 1967\"/><ref name=\"David G. Haglund 2007\"/> Churchill, caught between the U.S. and de Gaulle, tried to find a compromise.<ref name=\"Milton Viorst 1967\"/><ref name=\"David G. Haglund 2007\"/>\n\nFrom 1941 British Empire and Commonwealth forces invaded Vichy controlled territory in Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Middle East. The first began in 1941 during the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign|campaign against Syria and the Lebanon]] assisted with Free French troops. In two months of bitter fighting the region was seized and then put under Free French control. Around the same time after the [[East African campaign (World War II)|Italian defeat in East Africa]], Vichy controlled [[French Somaliland]] subsequently became blockaded by British and Free French forces. In a bloodless invasion the colony fell in mid 1942. In May of 1942 the Vichy controlled island of [[Madagascar]] was invaded. In a [[Battle of Madagascar|seven-month campaign]] the island was seized by British Empire forces. Finally in the latter half of 1942 the British with the help of US forces took part in the successful invasion of French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Most Vichy forces switched sides afterwards to help the allied cause during the [[Tunisian Campaign]] fighting as part of the [[British First Army]].\n\n====Levant Crisis====\n{{Further|Levant Crisis}}\nFollowing [[D-Day]], relations between the two peoples were at a high, as the British were greeted as liberators and remained so till the surrender of Germany in May 1945. At the end of that month, however, French troops, with their continued occupation of Syria, had tried to quell nationalist protests there. With heavy Syrian civilian casualties reported, Churchill demanded a ceasefire. With none forthcoming, he ordered British forces into Syria from [[Jordan]]. When they reached [[Damascus]] in June, the French were then escorted and confined to their barracks at gunpoint.<ref name=\"Luce\">{{cite book|last1=Luce|first1=Henry Robinson|title=Time, Volume 45|date=1945|publisher=Time Incorporated|pages=25\u201326|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U-ELAQAAIAAJ&q=}}</ref> That became known as the Levant Crisis and almost brought Britain and France to the point of conflict.

The UK was successful in strongly advocating that France be given a zone of [[occupied Germany]]. Both states were amongst the five [[Permanent Members]] of the new [[UN Security Council]], where they commonly collaborated. However, France was bitter when the United States and Britain refused to share atomic secrets with it. An American [[Operation Vulture|operation]] to use air strikes (including the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons) during the climax of the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in May 1954 was cancelled because of opposition by the British.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kowert|first=Paul |title=Groupthink or deadlock: when do leaders learn from their advisors?|edition=illustrated|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7914-5249-3|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3kUWAycjBsMC&pg=PA67 67\u201368]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3kUWAycjBsMC}}</ref><ref name=Tucker1999>{{Citation |last=Tucker|first=Spencer|title=Vietnam|edition=illustrated |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=76 |isbn=978-1-85728-922-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FEpuVkgzFJYC}}</ref> The upshot was France developed its own nuclear weapons and delivery systems.<ref>Peter K.

Despite its large pro-Soviet Communist Party, France joined the Allies. The first move was the Franco-British alliance realized in the Dunkirk Treaty in March 1947.<ref>Sean Greenwood,  \"Return to Dunkirk: The origins of the Anglo\u2010French treaty of March 1947.\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' 6.4 (1983): 49\u201365.</ref>\n\n====Suez Crisis====\n{{Main|Suez Crisis|France and weapons of mass destruction}}\nIn 1956 the [[Suez Canal]], previously owned by an Anglo-French company, was nationalised by the Egyptian government.

In particular, President [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s attempts to exclude the British from European affairs during France's early [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]] are now seen by many in Britain as a betrayal of the strong bond between the countries, and [[Anthony Eden]]'s exclusion of France from the Commonwealth is seen in a similar light in France. The French partly feared that were the British to join the EEC they would attempt to dominate it.\n\nOver the years, the UK and France have often taken diverging courses within the European Community. British policy has favoured an expansion of the Community and [[free trade]] while France has advocated a closer political union and restricting membership of the Community to a core of Western European states.\n\n====De Gaulle====\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Charles de Gaulle}}\nIn 1958 with France mired in a seemingly unwinnable war in [[Algeria]], de Gaulle returned to power in France. He created the [[Fifth French Republic]], ending the post-war parliamentary system and replacing it with a strong Presidency, which became dominated by his followers\u2014the [[Gaullists]]. De Gaulle made ambitious changes to French foreign policy\u2014first ending the war in Algeria, and then withdrawing France from the [[NATO]] command structure. The latter move was primarily symbolic, but NATO headquarters moved to Brussels and French generals had a much lesser role.<ref>Philip G. Cerny, ''The Politics of Grandeur: Ideological Aspects of de Gaulle's Foreign Policy'' (1980).</ref><ref>W.W. Kulski, ''De Gaulle and the World: The Foreign Policy of the Fifth French Republic'' (1966) passim [https://archive.org/details/degaulleworld00kuls online free to borrow]</ref>\n\nFrench policy blocking British entry into the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) was primarily motivated by political rather than economic considerations. In 1967, as in 1961\u201363, de Gaulle was determined to preserve France's dominance within the EEC, which was the foundation of the nation's international stature. His policy was to preserve the Community of Six while barring Britain. Although France succeeded in excluding Britain in the short term, in the longer term the French had to adjust their stance on enlargement in order to retain influence. De Gaulle feared that letting Britain into the European Community would open the way for Anglo-Saxon (i.e., US and UK) influence to overwhelm the France-West Germany coalition that was now dominant. On 14 January 1963, de Gaulle announced that France would [[History of the European Communities (1958\u20131972)#De Gaulle and EFTA|veto Britain's entry into the Common Market.]]<ref>Helen Parr, \"Saving the Community: The French response to Britain's second EEC application in 1967.\" ''Cold War History'' 6#4 (2006): 425\u2013454.</ref>\n\n===Since 1969===\n[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy MEDEF.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (2007\u20132012) tried to establish a closer relationship with the UK,<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-monde/a-londres-pompe-royale-pour-le-couple-sarkozy/924/0/232117 \u00c0 Londres, pompe royale pour le couple Sarkozy] \u2013 Le Point</ref> than existed under his predecessors [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]].]]\nWhen de Gaulle resigned in 1969, a new French government under [[Georges Pompidou]] was prepared to open a more friendly dialogue with Britain. He felt that in the economic crises of the 1970s Europe needed Britain. Pompidou welcomed British membership of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], opening the way for the United Kingdom to join it in 1973.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ronald Tiersky|author2=John Van Oudenaren|title=European Foreign Policies: Does Europe Still Matter?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbq-AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA167|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=167|isbn=9780742557802}}</ref>\n\nThe two countries' relationship was strained significantly in the lead-up to the 2003 [[War in Iraq]]. Britain and its American ally strongly advocated the use of force to remove [[Saddam Hussein]], while France (with China, Russia, and other nations) strongly opposed such action, with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] threatening to veto any resolution proposed to the [[UN Security Council]]. However, despite such differences Chirac and then British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] maintained a fairly close relationship during their years in office even after the Iraq War started.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/apr/05/france.foreignpolicy | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The odd couple | first=Martin | last=Kettle | date=5 April 2004 }}</ref> Both states asserted the importance of the [[Entente Cordiale]] alliance, and the role it had played during the 20th century.\n\n====Sarkozy presidency====\nFollowing his election in 2007, President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] attempted to forge closer relations between France and the United Kingdom: in March 2008, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said that \"there has never been greater cooperation between France and Britain as there is now\".<ref>[http://www.politics.co.uk/News/europe/eubritish-relations/attitudes-europe/french-uk-links-be-strengthened-in-entente-formidable-$1215798.htm French-UK links to be strengthened in 'entente formidable']</ref> Sarkozy also urged both countries to \"overcome our long-standing rivalries and build together a future that will be stronger because we will be together\".<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/uk?articleid=3918197 Be it cordiale or amicale, entente is here to stay]</ref> He also said \"If we want to change Europe my dear British friends\u2014and we [[Frenchmen]] do wish to change Europe\u2014we need you inside Europe to help us do so, not standing on the outside.\"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7313570.stm Sarkozy: We are stronger together] \u2013 BBC</ref> On 26 March 2008, Sarkozy had the privilege of giving a speech to both British [[Houses of Parliament]], where he called for a \"brotherhood\" between the two countries<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/27/nicolassarkozy.france1 President pays tribute to Britain and calls for 'brotherhood'] \u2013 ''The Guardian''</ref> and stated that \"France will never forget Britain's war sacrifice\" during World War II.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1582910/Nicolas-Sarkozy-France-will-never-forget-Britains-war-sacrifice.html Nicolas Sarkozy: 'France will never forget Britain's war sacrifice'] \u2013 The Daily Telegraph</ref>\n\nIn March 2008, Sarkozy made a [[state visit]] to Britain, promising closer cooperation between the two countries' governments in the future.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2008/03/26/sarkozy_britain_france_stronger_together/3146/\n|title=Sarkozy: Britain, France stronger together\n|date=26 March 2008\n|publisher=[[United International Press]]\n}}</ref>\n\n====Hollande presidency====\n[[File:G8 Summit working session on global and economic issues May 19, 2012.jpg|thumb|Cameron and Hollande at the G8 summit in 2012]]\nThe final months towards the end of [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]]'s tenure as President saw the [[Brexit|UK vote to leave the EU]].

Winter |year=1973 |isbn=978-3-533-02253-4}}</ref> The term [[Franglais]], a [[portmanteau]] combining the French words \"''fran\u00e7ais''\" and \"''anglais''\", refers to the combination of French and English (mostly in the UK) or the use of English words and nouns of Anglo-Saxon roots in French (in France).\n\n[[Modern English|Modern]] and [[Middle English]] reflect a mixture of [[O\u00efl languages|O\u00efl]] and [[Old English]] lexicons after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, when a Norman-speaking aristocracy took control of a population whose mother tongue was Germanic in origin. Due to the intertwined histories of England and continental possessions of the English Crown, many formal and legal words in Modern English have French roots. For example, ''buy'' and ''sell'' are of Germanic origin, while ''purchase'' and ''vend'' are from [[Old French]].\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Arsene-Wenger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|French football manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] has won three [[Premier League]] titles with [[Arsenal F.C.]] using teams with significant French players.]]\nIn the sport of [[rugby union]] there is a [[Le Crunch|rivalry between England and France]]. Both countries compete in the [[Six Nations Championship]] and the [[Rugby World Cup]]. England have the edge in both tournaments, having the most outright wins in the Six Nations (and its previous version the Five Nations), and most recently knocking the French team out of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] World Cups at the semi-final stage, although France knocked England out of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] with a convincing score in their quarter final match. Though rugby is originally a British sport, [[Rugby union in France|French rugby]] has developed to such an extent that the English and French teams are now stiff competitors, with neither side greatly superior to the other. While English influences spread rugby union at an early stage to Scotland, Wales and Ireland, as well as the Commonwealth realms, French influence spread the sport outside the commonwealth, to Italy, Argentina, Romania and Georgia.\n\nThe influence of French players and coaches on British football has been increasing in recent years and is often cited as an example of Anglo-French cooperation. In particular the [[Premier League]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] has become known for its Anglo-French connection due to a heavy influx of French players since the advent of French manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] in 1996. In March 2008 their [[Emirates stadium]] was chosen as the venue for a meeting during a [[state visit]] by the French President precisely for this reason.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/26/france.foreignpolicy Brown, Windsor and soccer for Sarkozy visit]</ref>\n\nMany people blamed the then French President Jacques Chirac for contributing to Paris' loss to London in its bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] after he made derogatory remarks about [[British cuisine]] and saying that \"only Finnish food is worse\".

Since 1995, the group of companies providing these services has been operating under the \"ETL\" brand.<ref>[https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/395129249/DE The German Patent and Trade Mark Office Register], consulted on 26 January 2016</ref>\n\n== Services ==\nThe ETL Group offers consultancy services for [[natural person|private individuals]], [[freelancer]]s as well as [[small and medium-sized enterprise]].

[[Sir Walter Raleigh]] devoted several pages in his ''History of the World'' (c. 1616) to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria.<ref>{{cite book |last = Raleigh |first = Walter |title = History of the World |pages = 358\u2013365 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions and legends==\n\nIn [[Hebrew Bible stories|Hebrew]] and [[Christian tradition]], Nimrod is considered the leader of those who built the Tower of Babel in the land of [[Shinar]],<ref>{{cite magazine |last = Menner |first = Robert J. |year = 1938 |title = Nimrod and the Wolf in the Old English 'Solomon and Saturn' |magazine = [[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |volume = 37 |issue = 3 |pages = 332\u201384 |jstor = 27704407 }}</ref> though the Bible never actually states this.

Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king [[Amraphel]], who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.\n\nSince Accad (Babylonian [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]) was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200\u20132154 BCE ([[long chronology]]), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late [[Early Bronze Age]]. The association with Erech (Babylonian [[Uruk]]), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BCE as a result of struggles between [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Elam]], also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin\u2014possibly inserted during the [[Babylonian captivity]].<ref name=vans />\n\nJudaic interpreters as early as [[Philo]] and [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] (1st century AD) interpreted \"a mighty hunter ''before'' the Lord\" (Heb.: \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, ''\u1e21ibb\u014dr-\u1e63ayi\u1e0f lip\u0304n\u00ea Yahweh'', lit. \"in the face of [[Yahweh]]\") as signifying \"''in opposition to'' the Lord\"; a similar interpretation is found in [[Pseudo-Philo]], as well as later in [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name ''Nimrod'' with a Hebrew word meaning 'rebel'. In Pseudo-Philo (dated c. AD 70), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while [[Joktan]] as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower.<ref>{{cite book |first = James |last = Kugel |title = Traditions of the Bible |year = 1998 |page = 230 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' (7th century AD).\n\nThe [[Book of Jubilees]] mentions the name of \"Nebrod\" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of [[Azurad]], the wife of [[Eber]] and mother of [[Peleg]] (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.\n\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|''Nimrod'' by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]\nJosephus wrote:\n{{quote|Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to reach. And that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers.\n\nNow the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion ...}}\n\nAn early [[Arabic]] work known as ''Kitab al-Magall'' or the ''Book of Rolls'' (part of [[Clementine literature]]) states that Nimrod built the towns of Had\u0101ni\u016bn, [[Ellasar]], [[Seleucia]], [[Ctesiphon]], R\u016bh\u012bn, [[Atrapatene]], Telal\u0101n, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when [[Reu]] was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building [[Nisibis]], Raha ([[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]) and [[Harran]] when [[Peleg]] was 50. It further adds that Nimrod \"saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown\". He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. \"For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from [[heaven]].\" Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the [[fourth son of Noah]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aa/aa2.htm |title = the ''Kitab al-Magall'' |publisher = Sacred-texts.com |accessdate = 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Recognitions'' (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king [[Ninus]], who first appears in the [[Greek people|Greek]] historian [[Ctesias]] as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the ''Homilies'' (H 9:4\u20136), Nimrod is made to be the same as [[Zoroaster]].\n\nThe [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (c. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the ''Kitab al-Magall'', except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called ''Sisan'', and the fourth son of Noah is called ''Yonton''.\n\n[[Jerome]], writing c. 390, explains in ''Hebrew Questions on Genesis'' that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, \"he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.\" However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in [[Sumer]], not [[Syria]].\n\nThe [[Ge'ez]] ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'' (c. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the ''Cave of Treasures'', but the crown maker is called ''Santal'', and the name of Noah's fourth son who instructs Nimrod is ''Barvin''.\n\nHowever, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] (306\u2013373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower\u2014for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.\n\n''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'' (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod's party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, [[Esau]] (grandson of [[Abraham]]), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', which adds that Nimrod had a son named ''Mardon'' who was even more wicked.<ref>See Louis Ginsberg ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol I, and the footnotes volume.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the 9th century [[Muslim]] historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, [[Allah]] destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, [[Abu al-Fida]], relates the same story, adding that the patriarch [[Eber]] (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian [[Masudi]] recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of [[Aram, son of Shem]], adding that he reigned 500 years over the [[Nabateans]]. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.\n\nIn [[Armenia]]n legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, [[Hayk]], defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with [[Bel (god)|Bel]]) in a battle near Lake Van.\n\nIn the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the [[Csodaszarvas|White Stag]] [''Feh\u00e9r Szarvas''] or Silver Stag), King Nimr\u00f3d (''M\u00e9nr\u00f3t'', often described as \"Nimr\u00f3d the Giant\" or \"the giant Nimr\u00f3d\", descendant of one of Noah's \"most wicked\" sons, Kam (references abound in traditions, legends, several religions and historical sources to persons and nations bearing the name of Kam or K\u00e1m, and overwhelmingly, the connotations are negative), is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel\u2014construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the event of the Great Flood (see biblical story of [[Noah's Ark]]). After the catastrophic failure (through God's will) of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the ensuing linguistic cacophony, Nimr\u00f3d the giant moved to the land of ''Evil\u00e1t'', where his wife, ''En\u00e9h'' gave birth to twin brothers ''Hunor'' and ''Magyar'' (aka ''Magor''). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimr\u00f3d especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer.\n\nBoth the Huns' and Magyars' historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimr\u00f3d. ([[Simon of K\u00e9za|Simon K\u00e9zai]], personal \"court priest\" of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus the Cuman]], in his ''Gesta Hungarorum'', 1282\u20131285. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979<!--http://arpad.org/pages.php?&menuid=21-->). Hungarian legends held that twin sons of King Nimr\u00f3d, [[Hunor and Magor]] were the ancestors of the [[Huns]] and the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians) respectively, siring their children through the two daughters of King Dul of the [[Alans]], whom they kidnapped after losing track of the silver stag whilst hunting.<ref>''Simon of K\u00e9za: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 1.4\u20135), pp. 13\u201317.</ref> The 16th-century Hungarian prelate [[Nicolaus Olahus]] claimed that [[Attila]] took for himself the title of ''Descendant of the Great Nimrod''.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Herbert |first1 = William |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XJ44AAAAMAAJ&dq=nicolas+olaus+attila+engaddi&pg=PA49&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=nicolas%20olaus%20attila%20engaddi&f=false | title = Attila, King of the Huns |website = Google Books | accessdate = 12 September 2019 |page = 49 }}</ref>\n\nNimrod figures in some very early versions of the history of [[Freemasonry]], where he was said to have been one of the fraternity's founders. According to the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: The legend of the Craft in the Old Constitutions refers to Nimrod as one of the founders of Masonry. Thus in the York MS., No. 1, we read: \"At ye making of ye toure of Babell there was a Masonrie first much esteemed of, and the King of Babilon yt called Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons.\" However, he does not figure in the current rituals.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe demon [[Nyyrikki]], figuring in the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' as a helper of [[Lemmink\u00e4inen]], is associated with Nimrod by some researchers and linguists.<ref>''Kalevala''.

[[Abraham]] cast into fire by Nimrod. From ''Zubdat-al Tawarikh'', a 1583 [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] manuscript.]]\nA confrontation between Nimrod and [[Abraham]] is said to have taken place, according to several Jewish and Islamic traditions. Some stories bring them both together in a cataclysmic collision, seen as a symbol of the confrontation between Good and Evil, and/or as a symbol of [[monotheism]] against [[polytheism]]. On the other hand, some Jewish traditions say only that the two men met and had a discussion.{{ref}}\n\nAccording to K. van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, this tradition is first attested in the writings of [[Pseudo-Philo]].<ref>{{harvp|Van der Toorn|Van der Horst|1990|p= 19|ps=.}}</ref> The story is also found in the [[Talmud]], and in rabbinical writings in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{Daat enc|he-title=\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3|id1=1058}}</ref>\n\nIn some versions (as in [[Flavius Josephus]]), Nimrod is a man who sets his will against that of God. In others, he proclaims himself a god and is worshipped as such by his subjects, sometimes with his consort [[Semiramis]] worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also [[Ninus]].)\n\nA portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to [[idolatry]]. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping Him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to [[Abraham and the Idol Shop|cease his idolatry]], whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of [[gnat]]s which destroys Nimrod's army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod's brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor [[Titus]], destroyer of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]).\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with [[Cain]]). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave [[Eliezer]], whom some accounts describe as Nimrod's own son. (The Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham's majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod.)\n\nStill other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham's crucial act of leaving [[Mesopotamia]] and settling in [[Canaan]] is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod's revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham's birth (as in the Bible, also ''[[Jubilees]]''); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.\n\nThe story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of [[Moses]]' birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings \u2013 [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]]. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], whose birth according to [[Herodotus]] was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.\n\nA confrontation is also found in the [[Quran]], between a king, not mentioned by name, and the Prophet [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Arabic for \"Abraham\"). Some Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In the quranic narrative Ibrahim has a discussion with the king, the former argues that Allah (God) is the one who gives life and causes death, whereas the unnamed King replies that he gives life and causes death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=258|title=Quran 2:258}}</ref> Ibrahim refutes him by stating that Allah brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered. The commentaries on this [[Surah]] offer a wide variety of embellishments of this narrative, one of which by [[Ibn Kathir]], a 14th-century scholar, adding that Nimrod showed his rule over life and death by killing a prisoner and freeing another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quranx.com/tafsirs/2.258|title=Tafsir Surah 2:258, ibn Kathir}}</ref>\n\nWhether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as \"Nimrod the Evil\" ({{lang-he|\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2}}).\n\nNimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baha'i scriptures, including the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]], the primary theological work of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion]]. There it is said that Nimrod \"dreamed a dream\" which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing \"the coming of Abraham\".<ref>[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-2.html \"The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\"] ''Baha'i Reference Library''. pp 41\u201380. Retrieved 10 September 2014.</ref> Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the [[B\u00e1b]] (the herald of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith). Citing examples of God's power, he asks:  \"Has He not, in past days, caused Abraham, in spite of His seeming helplessness, to triumph over the forces of Nimrod?\"<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Effendi |first1 = Shoghi |title = The Dawn-Breakers |url = http://bahai-library.com/books/dawnbreakers/chapters/3.html#94 |website = bahai-library.com |publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust |accessdate = 23 February 2016 |page = 94 }}</ref>\n\nThe story of Abraham's confrontation with Nimrod did not remain within the confines of learned writings and religious treatises, but also conspicuously influenced popular culture. A notable example is \"''[[Quando el Rey Nimrod]]''\" (\"When King Nimrod\"), one of the most well-known folksongs in [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (the Judeo-Spanish language), apparently written during the reign of King [[Alfonso X]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]. Beginning with the words: \"When King Nimrod went out to the fields/ Looked at the heavens and at the stars/He saw a holy light in the Jewish quarter/A sign that Abraham, our father, was about to be born\", the song gives a poetic account of the persecutions perpetrated by the cruel Nimrod and the miraculous birth and deeds of the savior Abraham.

This is repeated in the [[Books of Chronicles|First Book of Chronicles]] 1:10, and the \"Land of Nimrod\" used as a synonym for Assyria or Mesopotamia, is mentioned in the [[Book of Micah]] 5:6:\n\n{{quote|And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the'' land of Nimrod ''in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.}}\n\nGenesis says that the \"beginning of his kingdom\" (''reshit mamlakhto'') were the towns of \"[[Babylon|Babel]], [[Erech]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]] in the land of [[Shinar]]\" ([[Mesopotamia]]) (Gen 10:10)\u2014understood variously to imply that he either founded these cities, ruled over them, or both. Owing to an ambiguity in the original [[Hebrew]] text, it is unclear whether it is he or [[Ashur]] who additionally built [[Nineveh]], [[Resen (Genesis)|Resen]], [[Rehoboth-Ir]] and [[Calah]] (both interpretations are reflected in various [[English language|English]] versions). [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] devoted several pages in his ''History of the World'' (c. 1616) to reciting past scholarship regarding the question of whether it had been Nimrod or Ashur who built the cities in Assyria.<ref>{{cite book |last = Raleigh |first = Walter |title = History of the World |pages = 358\u2013365 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions and legends==\n\nIn [[Hebrew Bible stories|Hebrew]] and [[Christian tradition]], Nimrod is considered the leader of those who built the Tower of Babel in the land of [[Shinar]],<ref>{{cite magazine |last = Menner |first = Robert J. |year = 1938 |title = Nimrod and the Wolf in the Old English 'Solomon and Saturn' |magazine = [[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]] |volume = 37 |issue = 3 |pages = 332\u201384 |jstor = 27704407 }}</ref> though the Bible never actually states this.

Several of these early Judaic sources also assert that the king [[Amraphel]], who wars with Abraham later in Genesis, is none other than Nimrod himself.\n\nSince Accad (Babylonian [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]) was destroyed and lost with the destruction of its Empire in the period 2200\u20132154 BCE ([[long chronology]]), the stories mentioning Nimrod seem to recall the late [[Early Bronze Age]]. The association with Erech (Babylonian [[Uruk]]), a city that lost its prime importance around 2,000 BCE as a result of struggles between [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Elam]], also attests the early provenance of the stories of Nimrod. According to some modern-day theorists, their placement in the Bible suggests a Babylonian origin\u2014possibly inserted during the [[Babylonian captivity]].<ref name=vans />\n\nJudaic interpreters as early as [[Philo]] and [[Yochanan ben Zakai]] (1st century AD) interpreted \"a mighty hunter ''before'' the Lord\" (Heb.: \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, ''\u1e21ibb\u014dr-\u1e63ayi\u1e0f lip\u0304n\u00ea Yahweh'', lit. \"in the face of [[Yahweh]]\") as signifying \"''in opposition to'' the Lord\"; a similar interpretation is found in [[Pseudo-Philo]], as well as later in [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. Some rabbinic commentators have also connected the name ''Nimrod'' with a Hebrew word meaning 'rebel'. In Pseudo-Philo (dated c. AD 70), Nimrod is made leader of the Hamites, while [[Joktan]] as leader of the Semites, and Fenech as leader of the Japhethites, are also associated with the building of the Tower.<ref>{{cite book |first = James |last = Kugel |title = Traditions of the Bible |year = 1998 |page = 230 }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> Versions of this story are again picked up in later works such as ''[[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius]]'' (7th century AD).\n\nThe [[Book of Jubilees]] mentions the name of \"Nebrod\" (the Greek form of Nimrod) only as being the father of [[Azurad]], the wife of [[Eber]] and mother of [[Peleg]] (8:7). This account would thus make Nimrod an ancestor of Abraham, and hence of all Hebrews.\n\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|''Nimrod'' by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]\nJosephus wrote:\n{{quote|Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to reach. And that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers.\n\nNow the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion ...}}\n\nAn early [[Arabic]] work known as ''Kitab al-Magall'' or the ''Book of Rolls'' (part of [[Clementine literature]]) states that Nimrod built the towns of Had\u0101ni\u016bn, [[Ellasar]], [[Seleucia]], [[Ctesiphon]], R\u016bh\u012bn, [[Atrapatene]], Telal\u0101n, and others, that he began his reign as king over earth when [[Reu]] was 163, and that he reigned for 69 years, building [[Nisibis]], Raha ([[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]) and [[Harran]] when [[Peleg]] was 50. It further adds that Nimrod \"saw in the sky a piece of black cloth and a crown\". He called upon Sasan the weaver and commanded him to make him a crown like it, which he set jewels on and wore. He was allegedly the first king to wear a crown. \"For this reason people who knew nothing about it, said that a crown came down to him from [[heaven]].\" Later, the book describes how Nimrod established fire worship and idolatry, then received instruction in divination for three years from Bouniter, the [[fourth son of Noah]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aa/aa2.htm |title = the ''Kitab al-Magall'' |publisher = Sacred-texts.com |accessdate = 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Recognitions'' (R 4.29), one version of the Clementines, Nimrod is equated with the legendary Assyrian king [[Ninus]], who first appears in the [[Greek people|Greek]] historian [[Ctesias]] as the founder of Nineveh. However, in another version, the ''Homilies'' (H 9:4\u20136), Nimrod is made to be the same as [[Zoroaster]].\n\nThe [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (c. 350) contains an account of Nimrod very similar to that in the ''Kitab al-Magall'', except that Nisibis, Edessa and Harran are said to be built by Nimrod when Reu was 50, and that he began his reign as the first king when Reu was 130. In this version, the weaver is called ''Sisan'', and the fourth son of Noah is called ''Yonton''.\n\n[[Jerome]], writing c. 390, explains in ''Hebrew Questions on Genesis'' that after Nimrod reigned in Babel, \"he also reigned in Arach [Erech], that is, in Edissa; and in Achad [Accad], which is now called Nisibis; and in Chalanne [Calneh], which was later called Seleucia after King Seleucus when its name had been changed, and which is now in actual fact called Ctesiphon.\" However, this traditional identification of the cities built by Nimrod in Genesis is no longer accepted by modern scholars, who consider them to be located in [[Sumer]], not [[Syria]].\n\nThe [[Ge'ez]] ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'' (c. 5th century) also contains a version similar to that in the ''Cave of Treasures'', but the crown maker is called ''Santal'', and the name of Noah's fourth son who instructs Nimrod is ''Barvin''.\n\nHowever, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] (306\u2013373) relates a contradictory view, that Nimrod was righteous and opposed the builders of the Tower. Similarly, ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' (date uncertain) mentions a Jewish tradition that Nimrod left Shinar in southern Mesopotamia and fled to Assyria in northern Mesopotamia, because he refused to take part in building the Tower\u2014for which God rewarded him with the four cities in Assyria, to substitute for the ones in Babel.\n\n''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]'' (c. 833) relates the Jewish traditions that Nimrod inherited the garments of Adam and Eve from his father Cush, and that these made him invincible. Nimrod's party then defeated the Japhethites to assume universal rulership. Later, [[Esau]] (grandson of [[Abraham]]), ambushed, beheaded, and robbed Nimrod. These stories later reappear in other sources including the 16th century ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]'', which adds that Nimrod had a son named ''Mardon'' who was even more wicked.<ref>See Louis Ginsberg ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol I, and the footnotes volume.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings (book)|History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the 9th century [[Muslim]] historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], Nimrod has the tower built in Babil, [[Allah]] destroys it, and the language of mankind, formerly [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is then confused into 72 languages. Another Muslim historian of the 13th century, [[Abu al-Fida]], relates the same story, adding that the patriarch [[Eber]] (an ancestor of Abraham) was allowed to keep the original tongue, Hebrew in this case, because he would not partake in the building. The 10th-century Muslim historian [[Masudi]] recounts a legend making the Nimrod who built the tower to be the son of Mash, the son of [[Aram, son of Shem]], adding that he reigned 500 years over the [[Nabateans]]. Later, Masudi lists Nimrod as the first king of Babylon, and states that he dug great canals and reigned 60 years. Still elsewhere, he mentions another king Nimrod, son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], as the one who introduced astrology and attempted to kill Abraham.\n\nIn [[Armenia]]n legend, the ancestor of the Armenian people, [[Hayk]], defeated Nimrod (sometimes equated with [[Bel (god)|Bel]]) in a battle near Lake Van.\n\nIn the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] legend of the Enchanted Stag (more commonly known as the [[Csodaszarvas|White Stag]] [''Feh\u00e9r Szarvas''] or Silver Stag), King Nimr\u00f3d (''M\u00e9nr\u00f3t'', often described as \"Nimr\u00f3d the Giant\" or \"the giant Nimr\u00f3d\", descendant of one of Noah's \"most wicked\" sons, Kam (references abound in traditions, legends, several religions and historical sources to persons and nations bearing the name of Kam or K\u00e1m, and overwhelmingly, the connotations are negative), is the first person referred to as forefather of the Hungarians. He, along with his entire nation, is also the giant responsible for the building of the Tower of Babel\u2014construction of which was supposedly started by him 201 years after the event of the Great Flood (see biblical story of [[Noah's Ark]]). After the catastrophic failure (through God's will) of that most ambitious endeavour and in the midst of the ensuing linguistic cacophony, Nimr\u00f3d the giant moved to the land of ''Evil\u00e1t'', where his wife, ''En\u00e9h'' gave birth to twin brothers ''Hunor'' and ''Magyar'' (aka ''Magor''). Father and sons were, all three of them, prodigious hunters, but Nimr\u00f3d especially is the archetypal, consummate, legendary hunter and archer.\n\nBoth the Huns' and Magyars' historically attested skill with the recurve bow and arrow are attributed to Nimr\u00f3d. ([[Simon of K\u00e9za|Simon K\u00e9zai]], personal \"court priest\" of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus the Cuman]], in his ''Gesta Hungarorum'', 1282\u20131285. This tradition can also be found in over twenty other medieval Hungarian chronicles, as well as a German one, according to Dr Antal Endrey in an article published in 1979<!--http://arpad.org/pages.php?&menuid=21-->). Hungarian legends held that twin sons of King Nimr\u00f3d, [[Hunor and Magor]] were the ancestors of the [[Huns]] and the [[Magyars]] (Hungarians) respectively, siring their children through the two daughters of King Dul of the [[Alans]], whom they kidnapped after losing track of the silver stag whilst hunting.<ref>''Simon of K\u00e9za: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 1.4\u20135), pp. 13\u201317.</ref> The 16th-century Hungarian prelate [[Nicolaus Olahus]] claimed that [[Attila]] took for himself the title of ''Descendant of the Great Nimrod''.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Herbert |first1 = William |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XJ44AAAAMAAJ&dq=nicolas+olaus+attila+engaddi&pg=PA49&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=nicolas%20olaus%20attila%20engaddi&f=false | title = Attila, King of the Huns |website = Google Books | accessdate = 12 September 2019 |page = 49 }}</ref>\n\nNimrod figures in some very early versions of the history of [[Freemasonry]], where he was said to have been one of the fraternity's founders. According to the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: The legend of the Craft in the Old Constitutions refers to Nimrod as one of the founders of Masonry. Thus in the York MS., No. 1, we read: \"At ye making of ye toure of Babell there was a Masonrie first much esteemed of, and the King of Babilon yt called Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons.\" However, he does not figure in the current rituals.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe demon [[Nyyrikki]], figuring in the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' as a helper of [[Lemmink\u00e4inen]], is associated with Nimrod by some researchers and linguists.<ref>''Kalevala''.

[[Abraham]] cast into fire by Nimrod. From ''Zubdat-al Tawarikh'', a 1583 [[Ottoman Turkish]] manuscript.]]\nA confrontation between Nimrod and [[Abraham]] is said to have taken place, according to several Jewish and Islamic traditions. Some stories bring them both together in a cataclysmic collision, seen as a symbol of the confrontation between Good and Evil, and/or as a symbol of [[monotheism]] against [[polytheism]]. On the other hand, some Jewish traditions say only that the two men met and had a discussion.{{ref}}\n\nAccording to K. van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, this tradition is first attested in the writings of [[Pseudo-Philo]].<ref>{{harvp|Van der Toorn|Van der Horst|1990|p= 19|ps=.}}</ref> The story is also found in the [[Talmud]], and in rabbinical writings in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{Daat enc|he-title=\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3|id1=1058}}</ref>\n\nIn some versions (as in [[Flavius Josephus]]), Nimrod is a man who sets his will against that of God. In others, he proclaims himself a god and is worshipped as such by his subjects, sometimes with his consort [[Semiramis]] worshipped as a goddess at his side. (See also [[Ninus]].)\n\nA portent in the stars tells Nimrod and his astrologers of the impending birth of Abraham, who would put an end to [[idolatry]]. Nimrod therefore orders the killing of all newborn babies. However, Abraham's mother escapes into the fields and gives birth secretly. At a young age, Abraham recognizes God and starts worshipping Him. He confronts Nimrod and tells him face-to-face to [[Abraham and the Idol Shop|cease his idolatry]], whereupon Nimrod orders him burned at the stake. In some versions, Nimrod has his subjects gather wood for four whole years, so as to burn Abraham in the biggest bonfire the world had ever seen. Yet when the fire is lit, Abraham walks out unscathed.\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod then challenges Abraham to battle. When Nimrod appears at the head of enormous armies, Abraham produces an army of [[gnat]]s which destroys Nimrod's army. Some accounts have a gnat or mosquito enter Nimrod's brain and drive him out of his mind (a divine retribution which Jewish tradition also assigned to the Roman Emperor [[Titus]], destroyer of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]).\n\nIn some versions, Nimrod repents and accepts God, offering numerous sacrifices that God rejects (as with [[Cain]]). Other versions have Nimrod give to Abraham, as a conciliatory gift, the giant slave [[Eliezer]], whom some accounts describe as Nimrod's own son. (The Bible also mentions Eliezer as Abraham's majordomo, though not making any connection between him and Nimrod.)\n\nStill other versions have Nimrod persisting in his rebellion against God, or resuming it. Indeed, Abraham's crucial act of leaving [[Mesopotamia]] and settling in [[Canaan]] is sometimes interpreted as an escape from Nimrod's revenge. Accounts considered canonical place the building of the Tower many generations before Abraham's birth (as in the Bible, also ''[[Jubilees]]''); however in others, it is a later rebellion after Nimrod failed in his confrontation with Abraham. In still other versions, Nimrod does not give up after the Tower fails, but goes on to try storming Heaven in person, in a chariot driven by birds.\n\nThe story attributes to Abraham elements from the story of [[Moses]]' birth (the cruel king killing innocent babies, with the midwives ordered to kill them) and from the careers of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] who emerged unscathed from the fire. Nimrod is thus given attributes of two archetypal cruel and persecuting kings \u2013 [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]]. Some Jewish traditions also identified him with [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], whose birth according to [[Herodotus]] was accompanied by portents, which made his grandfather try to kill him.\n\nA confrontation is also found in the [[Quran]], between a king, not mentioned by name, and the Prophet [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] (Arabic for \"Abraham\"). Some Muslim commentators assign Nimrod as the king. In the quranic narrative Ibrahim has a discussion with the king, the former argues that Allah (God) is the one who gives life and causes death, whereas the unnamed King replies that he gives life and causes death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=258|title=Quran 2:258}}</ref> Ibrahim refutes him by stating that Allah brings the Sun up from the East, and so he asks the king to bring it from the West. The king is then perplexed and angered. The commentaries on this [[Surah]] offer a wide variety of embellishments of this narrative, one of which by [[Ibn Kathir]], a 14th-century scholar, adding that Nimrod showed his rule over life and death by killing a prisoner and freeing another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quranx.com/tafsirs/2.258|title=Tafsir Surah 2:258, ibn Kathir}}</ref>\n\nWhether or not conceived as having ultimately repented, Nimrod remained in Jewish and Islamic tradition an emblematic evil person, an archetype of an idolater and a tyrannical king. In rabbinical writings up to the present, he is almost invariably referred to as \"Nimrod the Evil\" ({{lang-he|\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e2}}).\n\nNimrod is mentioned by name in several places in the Baha'i scriptures, including the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]], the primary theological work of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion]]. There it is said that Nimrod \"dreamed a dream\" which his soothsayers interpreted as signifying the birth of a new star in heaven. A herald is then said to have appeared in the land announcing \"the coming of Abraham\".<ref>[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-2.html \"The Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\"] ''Baha'i Reference Library''. pp 41\u201380. Retrieved 10 September 2014.</ref> Nimrod is also mentioned in one of the earliest writings of the [[B\u00e1b]] (the herald of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith).

{"title_page": "Hector MacAndrew", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n'''Hector MacAndrew''' (1903-1980) was the foremost Scottish fiddler of the second half of the 20th. century. He was born in 1903, in a cottage on the Fyvie Castle Estate in Aberdeenshire, where his father was head gardener and piper to Lord Leith. The family was musical - Peter, his father, was a good fiddler as well as a piper and Hector's brother Pat was also a fine, prize-winning piper. No surprise, then, that he began playing very early in life. As a young man he received some classical training in Edinburgh, which may help to account for the full and generous sound he made, particularly in slow airs; but valuable as this experience was, it never blurred or diluted his awareness of the aural tradition going back to the Gows which he venerated and came to embody.  Like his father, he became an estate gardener, eventually at Keithhall House, Inverurie, the residence of the Earl of Kintore. By this time (1933) he was much in demand as a player at social occasions and eventually on Radio Aberdeen. During the War he served in the Royal Artillery and was with the Eighth Army from El Alamein to Trieste when the War ended. He talked little of his wartime experiences, but  was at this time that he determined that, should he survive, he would devote himself as far as possible to keeping the great tradition of Scottish fiddle playing alive.it \n\nHome again, he began to make recordings on the Parlophone label, for the School of Scottish Studies and the BBC. His small cottage in Cults became the centre for visits from many enthusiasts of Scottish fiddling. He judged many fiddle competitions, and it was at one of these, in the City Hall in Perth, that he met Yehudi Menuhin for the first time. Menuhin was greatly impressed by his playing and his knowledge of the ins and outs of traditional Scottish fiddling and in 1974 they made a television programme ('Mr. Menuhin's Welcome to Blair Castle') on Scots Fiddle Music in Blair Castle, where Niel Gow, the doyen of Scots fiddlers, had played regularly 200 years before. Of Hector, Menuhin wrote, 'What he knew could only be learned from people with a great musical tradition, and I have a kind of reverence, almost awe, for someone who represents a tradition as exciting as that. .... ... to me, of course, he was the voice of Scotland. When I met this man and heard him play, I knew I was in the presence of Scottish history.'   He died six years later on 5th. April, 1980, following  a stroke, acknowledged by such as Ron Gonnella, Ian Powrie and Willie Hunter as the greatest Scots fiddler of his generation.\n\nHector MacAndrew was an expert in the playing of pipe music on the fiddle. He had many friends among the piping community, men who admired his approach to 'their' tunes. Of contemporary pipers he particularly admired G.S. McLennan, Angus Mackay and William Lawrie. Yet to him the strathspey was the soul of Scots fiddling. He never played for dancing, and his approach to these tunes, which was personal, led him to use whichever tempo he felt suited to a particular melody. A favourite strathspey was 'Craigellachie Bridge' by William Marshall (1748-1833), and indeed he also liked Marshall's inventive reels and, perhaps, the technical challenge that some of Marshall's music offered - once, when asked why he wrote music that was so difficult to play, Marshall answered (uncompromisingly) that he 'did not write for bunglers' ; Hector MacAndrew enjoyed and admired this challenging music, and of all fiddle composers, it was Marshall he regarded most highly (though he also had a soft spot for Peter Milne). Hector was himself a considerable composer of fiddle tunes, and a book of his tunes, 97 of them, The MacAndrew Collection, was published in 2002. His air, 'Gight Castle', is particularly haunting. He was, however, dismissive of his efforts in this field, too much so friends, colleagues and pupils believed, and his aim, he said, was never for publication ; but there is no doubt that the eventual book added a valuable addition to the library available to Scots fiddlers.    \n\nHe used traditional techniques to inform his playing : the up-driven bow, 4th. finger unisons, double stopping, bowed, slurred and syncopated triplets and octaves. Of all of these he was an absolute master. His intonation was impeccable and his skill in varying tone quality and colour added much to everything he played, particularly the airs.  He had complete technical control - you only need to hear his introduction to 'Auld Robin Gray'with its elaborate double stopping, stopped trills, use of position work and rapid semi-quavers to be aware of that. One of his pupils, Douglas Lawrence, describes how Hector played the final movement of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto from memory sitting cross-legged on the arm of the settee in the Lawrence cottage on the Black Isle. He did not use microphones ; unlike some even quite famous players, he respected the fine Pietro Guarneri  violin he used, dusting excess rosin away and keeping it always in very good order. His technical control, the rich tone he could draw from his violin and his intimate knowledge of the fiddling past, made him what he was - the embodiment of a noble tradition and an exponent unequalled in his own time whose playing was a source of pleasure and wonder to all who heard it.   \n\n\n==External links==\n* [http://scotchmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Article-2.3-MacAndrew.pdf Hector MacAndrew: A personal memoir] by Michael Welch\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MacAndrew, Hector}}\n[[Category:Scottish fiddlers]]\n[[Category:British male violinists]]\n[[Category:1903 births]]\n[[Category:1980 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century violinists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Scottish musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century British male musicians]]\n\n\n{{Scotland-musician-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n'''Hector MacAndrew''' (1903-1980) was the foremost Scottish fiddler of the second half of the 20th. century.
