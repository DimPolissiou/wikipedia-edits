Denise and her husband purchased the corner caf\u00e9 and number 16 Stanley Street from Roy's widow [[Nikki Warrington]]. They started a restaurant on the site of the caf\u00e9 and the family moved into number 16. Les's old friend [[Caleb Andrews]] (Steve Toussaint) was employed to work in the restaurant as a cook.\n\nDenise initially tried to keep secret the truth about a long-ago affair with Caleb, and the fact that Brendan was actually Caleb's son. Denise and Caleb resumed their affair, but quickly ended it when Denise realised she loved Les, however Les found out about it soon after.\n\nDuring her time on Stanley Street, Denise built up strong friendships with Cat MacKenzie, Chrissy Costello, Eileen Callan and Cheryl Barker. The five of them formed a pub darts team.\n\nWhile walking home one night in December 2004, Denise was raped by an unidentified assailant. Les immediately suspected Christian Habgood, Denise's tutor at Charnham College. However, when entering the car of local taxi driver [[Graham Harker]] ([[Lee Warburton]]) Denise suspected him of the crime based only on her recollections of the smell of his aftershave and his usage of the phrase \"Scout's honour\". The police questioned Harker, but no forensic evidence could be found to link him to the crime and they were forced to release him due to lack of evidence. Denise persisted with her desire to see him arrested, and eventually learned the true identity of her attacker.\n\nShortly after this Denise discovered that Les had been to see prostitutes on a number of occasions. Marriage counselling was unsuccessful, the couple split and in late 2005 Denise moved away. Her daughter Kelly and granddaughter Susie later joined her.\n\nDenise was portrayed by Claire Perkins.\n\n===Kelly Boulter===\n'''Kelly Boulter''', played by Carryl Thomas, made her first appearance in October 2003 and departed in August 2005.\n\nKelly first appeared in Charnham in October 2003, around the time she was dating [[Benji McHugh]]. Kelly had also been sleeping with Justin MacKenzie. When Kelly fell pregnant with twins, there was some doubt over the paternity of the babies. Eventually, Justin was revealed to be the father. Despite Benji's warnings to take things easy, Kelly began drinking and as a result collapsed and was hospitalized. In hospital, doctors revealed Kelly had lost one of the twins. Benji left Charnham for sunnier climes after this.\n\nKelly's family, particular her father Les and brother [[Brendan Boulter|Brendan]] didn't really care for Justin, as they liked Benji. However, Denise, Kelly's mother was prepared to give Justin the benefit of the doubt. After the Boulters had settled into the area and purchased the corner cafe previously owned by [[Roy Farmer]] until his death in a fire at the same premises in November 2003, Kelly had made some friends in local teenage girls [[Lucy Day]] and [[Melanie Costello]].\n\nIn July 2004, Kelly gave birth to a baby girl, Susie, named after Justin's mother. Justin and Kelly later became engaged.Throughout the rest of the year, Kelly was involved in several family dramas including the break-up of Brendan's marriage to Melanie following a revelation that Brendan was bisexual; and Denise's rape.\n\nIn early 2005, Kelly and Justin were horrified when they were accused of abusing Susie, after she had suffered severe head injuries. The Boulters and MacKenzies were under surveillance from social workers for several months until a judge at a hearing was satisfied that nobody was at fault but ordered a review every three months.\n\nIn August 2005, after Denise had left Les, Kelly wasn't too far behind as her relationship with Justin fell apart after he'd slept with a friend of hers from College; Scarlet Anderson. It turned out Scarlet had also slept with Les. Following this, Kelly left Charnham, taking Susie with her and later joined Denise.\n\n===Les Boulter===\n'''Lester \"Les\" Boulter''', played by Howard Saddler, made his first appearance in November 2003. He departed in August 2005.\n\nLes first appeared in Charnham in November 2003, shortly after he and his wife Denise, had heard the news that their daughter Kelly was pregnant. Just before Christmas, Les and Denise moved into the area and began running their own Cafe on the site of the previous Cybercafe that had been destroyed in a fire, resulting in the death of the owner, [[Roy Farmer]].\n\nLes took a dislike to Kelly's boyfriend, Justin MacKenzie but eventually warmed to him.\n\nDuring the first few months of 2004, Denise had been having an affair with old friend, Caleb Andrews. Les found out but eventually forgave Denise. Further shocks were to come when Les discovered Brendan wasn't his son, but Brendan reassured Les that he considered him his dad.\n\nThings went from bad to worse between Les and Denise. Les became jealous of Denise spending so much time with her tutor at Charnahm College, Christian Habgood. One night in December, Denise was [[raped]] while walking through an alleyway.\n\nWhen cab driver Graham Harker moved into Stanley Street, Denise immediately recognised his voice. After months of high drama and Graham's arrest for kidnapping Denise and holding her daughter-in-law [[Melanie Costello|Melanie]] against her will in his flat, Les and Denise tried to get things back to normal but the damage had been done.\n\nLes began seeing prostitutes on two occasions, despite hesitating. Les was arrested on the spot one day and fined. Following this, Les and Denise separated.\n\nLes sold the corner cafe to [[Marc MacKenzie]] and moved up to Liverpool, leaving Justin in charge of letting his house.\n\n===Conor Byrne===\nConor Byrne was Declan's brother, resident in Charnham for several months in 2000.\n\nConor was played by Glenn Mulhern.\n\n===Declan Byrne===\nDeclan Byrne was played by Quentin Jones between 1999 and 2001.\n\n==C==\n\n===Eileen Callan===\n{{Main|Eileen Callan}}\nEileen Callan (n\u00e9e Day) was played by [[Rosie Rowell]] from 2002 until final episode in 2005.\n\n===Pete Callan===\n\nPeter 'Pete' Callan was played by [[David Easter]] from 1997 to 2005.\n\nPete becomes close to [[Julie-Ann Jones]] ([[Chloe Howman]]) and nearly sleeps with her.

Les immediately suspected Christian Habgood, Denise's tutor at Charnham College. However, when entering the car of local taxi driver [[Graham Harker]] ([[Lee Warburton]]) Denise suspected him of the crime based only on her recollections of the smell of his aftershave and his usage of the phrase \"Scout's honour\". The police questioned Harker, but no forensic evidence could be found to link him to the crime and they were forced to release him due to lack of evidence. Denise persisted with her desire to see him arrested, and eventually learned the true identity of her attacker.\n\nShortly after this Denise discovered that Les had been to see prostitutes on a number of occasions.

Justin and Kelly later became engaged.Throughout the rest of the year, Kelly was involved in several family dramas including the break-up of Brendan's marriage to Melanie following a revelation that Brendan was bisexual; and Denise's rape.\n\nIn early 2005, Kelly and Justin were horrified when they were accused of abusing Susie, after she had suffered severe head injuries. The Boulters and MacKenzies were under surveillance from social workers for several months until a judge at a hearing was satisfied that nobody was at fault but ordered a review every three months.\n\nIn August 2005, after Denise had left Les, Kelly wasn't too far behind as her relationship with Justin fell apart after he'd slept with a friend of hers from College; Scarlet Anderson.

Les became jealous of Denise spending so much time with her tutor at Charnahm College, Christian Habgood. One night in December, Denise was [[raped]] while walking through an alleyway.\n\nWhen cab driver Graham Harker moved into Stanley Street, Denise immediately recognised his voice. After months of high drama and Graham's arrest for kidnapping Denise and holding her daughter-in-law [[Melanie Costello|Melanie]] against her will in his flat, Les and Denise tried to get things back to normal but the damage had been done.\n\nLes began seeing prostitutes on two occasions, despite hesitating.

{"title_page": "Tradition and the Individual Talent", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n'''\"Tradition and the Individual Talent\"''' (1919) is an essay written by poet and literary critic [[T. S. Eliot]]. The essay was first published in ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'' (1919) and later in Eliot's first book of criticism, [[The Sacred Wood (T. S. Eliot)|\"The Sacred Wood\" (1920)]].<ref>Gallup, Donald. ''T. S. Eliot: A Bibliography (A Revised and Extended Edition)'' Harcourt, Brace & World, New York, 1969. pp. 27\u20138, 204\u20135 (listings A5, C90, C7)</ref> The essay is also available in Eliot's \"Selected Prose\" and \"[[Selected Essays, 1917-1932|Selected Essays]]\".''\n\nWhile Eliot is most often known for his poetry, he also contributed to the field of literary criticism. In this dual role, he acted as poet-critic, comparable to [[Sir Philip Sidney]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\" is one of the more well known works that Eliot produced in his critic capacity. It formulates Eliot's influential conception of the relationship between the poet and preceding literary traditions.\n\n==Content of the essay==\nThis essay is divided into three parts: first the concept of \"Tradition,\" then the Theory of Impersonal Poetry, and finally the conclusion.\n\nEliot presents his conception of tradition and the definition of the poet and poetry in relation to it. He wishes to correct the fact that, as he perceives it, \"in English writing we seldom speak of tradition, though we occasionally apply its name in deploring its absence.\"  Eliot posits that, though the English tradition generally upholds the belief that art progresses through change \u2013 a separation from tradition, literary advancements are instead recognised only when they conform to the tradition. Eliot, a [[Classics|classicist]], felt that the true incorporation of tradition into literature was unrecognised, that tradition, a word that \"seldom... appear[s] except in a phrase of censure,\" was actually a thus-far unrealised element of literary criticism.\n\nFor Eliot, the term \"tradition\" is imbued with a special and complex character. It represents a \"simultaneous order,\" by which Eliot means a historical timelessness \u2013 a fusion of past and present \u2013 and, at the same time, a sense of present temporality. A poet must embody \"the whole of the literature of Europe from [[Homer]],\" while, simultaneously, expressing their contemporary environment. Eliot challenges the common perception that a poet's greatness and individuality lie in their departure from their predecessors; he argues that \"the most individual parts of his [the poet's] work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.\"  Eliot claims that this \"historical sense\" is not only a resemblance to traditional works but an awareness and understanding of their relation to his poetry.\n\nThis fidelity to tradition, however, does not require the great poet to forfeit novelty in an act of surrender to repetition. Rather, Eliot has a much more dynamic and progressive conception of the poetic process: novelty is possible only through tapping into tradition. When a poet engages in the creation of new work, they realise an aesthetic \"ideal order,\" as it has been established by the literary tradition that has come before them. As such, the act of artistic creation does not take place in a vacuum. The introduction of a new work alters the cohesion of this existing order, and causes a readjustment of the old to accommodate the new. The inclusion of the new work alters the way in which the past is seen; elements of the past that are noted and realised. In Eliot\u2019s own words, \"What happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art that preceded it.\" Eliot refers to this organic tradition, this developing canon, as the \"mind of Europe.\" The private mind is subsumed by this more massive one. \n\nThis leads to Eliot\u2019s so-called \"Impersonal Theory\" of poetry. Since the poet engages in a \"continual surrender of himself\" to the vast order of tradition, artistic creation is a process of depersonalisation. The mature poet is viewed as a medium, through which tradition is channelled and elaborated. They compare the poet to a catalyst in a chemical reaction, in which the reactants are feelings and emotions that are synthesised to create an artistic image that captures and relays these same feelings and emotions. While the mind of the poet is necessary for the production, it emerges unaffected by the process. The artist stores feelings and emotions and properly unites them into a specific combination, which is the artistic product. What lends greatness to a work of art are not the feelings and emotions themselves, but the nature of the artistic process by which they are synthesised. The artist is responsible for creating \"the pressure, so to speak, under which the fusion takes place.\" And, it is the intensity of fusion that renders art great. In this view, Eliot rejects the theory that art expresses metaphysical unity in the soul of the poet. The poet is a depersonalised vessel, a mere medium.\n\nGreat works do not express the personal emotion of the poet. The poet does not reveal their own unique and novel emotions, but rather, by drawing on ordinary ones and channelling them through the intensity of poetry, they express feelings that surpass, altogether, experienced emotion. This is what Eliot intends when he discusses poetry as an \"escape from emotion.\" Since successful poetry is impersonal and, therefore, exists independent of its poet, it outlives the poet and can incorporate into the timeless \"ideal order\" of the \"living\" literary tradition. \n\nAnother essay found in ''Selected Essays'' relates to this notion of the impersonal poet. In \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\" Eliot presents the phrase \"[[objective correlative]].\" The theory is that the expression of emotion in art can be achieved by a specific, and almost formulaic, prescription of a set of objects, including events and situations. A particular emotion is created by presenting its correlated objective sign. The author is depersonalised in this conception, since he is the mere effecter of the sign. And, it is the sign, and not the poet, which creates emotion.\n\nThe implications here separate Eliot's idea of talent from the conventional definition (just as his idea of Tradition is separate from the conventional definition), one so far from it, perhaps, that he chooses never to directly label it as talent. Whereas the conventional definition of talent, especially in the arts, is a genius that one is born with. Not so for Eliot. Instead, talent is acquired through a careful study of poetry, claiming that Tradition, \"cannot be inherited, and if you want it, you must obtain it by great labour.\" Eliot asserts that it is absolutely necessary for the poet to study, to have an understanding of the poets before them, and to be well versed enough that they can understand and incorporate the \"mind of Europe\" into their poetry. But the poet's study is unique \u2013 it is knowledge that \"does not encroach,\" and that does not \"deaden or pervert poetic sensibility.\" It is, to put it most simply, a poetic knowledge \u2013 knowledge observed through a poetic lens. This ideal implies that knowledge gleaned by a poet is not knowledge of facts, but knowledge which leads to a greater understanding of the mind of Europe. As Eliot explains, \"[[Shakespeare]] acquired more essential history from [[Plutarch]] than most men could from the whole [[British Museum]].\"\n\n==Eliot and New Criticism==\nUnwittingly, Eliot inspired and informed the movement of [[New Criticism]]. This is somewhat ironic, since he later criticised their intensely detailed analysis of texts as unnecessarily tedious. Yet, he does share with them the same focus on the aesthetic and stylistic qualities of poetry, rather than on its ideological content. The New Critics resemble Eliot in their close analysis of particular passages and poems.\n\n==Criticism of Eliot==\nEliot's theory of literary tradition has been criticised for its limited definition of what constitutes the canon of that tradition. He assumes the authority to choose what represents great poetry, and his choices have been criticised on several fronts. For example, [[Harold Bloom]] disagrees with Eliot's condescension towards Romantic poetry, which, in ''The Metaphysical Poets'' (1921) he criticises for its \"dissociation of sensibility.\" Moreover, many believe Eliot's discussion of the literary tradition as the \"mind of Europe\" reeks of Euro-centrism. However, it should be recognized that Eliot supported many Eastern and thus non-European works of literature such as the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Eliot was arguing the importance of a complete sensibility: he didn't particularly care what it was at the time of tradition and the individual talent. His own work is heavily influenced by non-Western traditions. In his broadcast talk \"The Unity of European Culture,\" he said, \"Long ago I studied the ancient Indian languages and while I was chiefly interested at that time in Philosophy, I read a little poetry too; and I know that my own poetry shows the influence of Indian thought and sensibility.\" His self-evaluation was confirmed by B. P. N. Sinha, who writes that Eliot went beyond Indian ideas to Indian form: \"The West has preoccupied itself almost exclusively with the philosophy and thoughts of India. One consequence of this has been a total neglect of Indian forms of expression, i.e. of its literature. T. S. Eliot is the one major poet whose work bears evidence of intercourse with this aspect of Indian culture\" (qtd. in ''The Composition of'' The Four Quartets). He does not account for a non-white and non-masculine tradition. As such, his notion of tradition stands at odds with feminist, post-colonial and minority theories.\n\n[[Harold Bloom]] presents a conception of tradition that differs from that of Eliot. Whereas Eliot believes that the great poet is faithful to his predecessors and evolves in a concordant manner, Bloom (according to his theory of \"[[anxiety of influence]]\") envisions the \"strong poet\" to engage in a much more aggressive and tumultuous rebellion against tradition.\n\nIn 1964, his last year, Eliot published in a reprint of ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', a series of lectures he gave at [[Harvard University]] in 1932 and 1933, a new preface in which he called \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\" the most juvenile of his essays (although he also indicated that he did not repudiate it.)<ref>Eliot, T.S., ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism\", 1964 edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Preface</ref>\n\n==Primary works of literary criticism by T.

S. Eliot]]. The essay was first published in ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'' (1919) and later in Eliot's first book of criticism, [[The Sacred Wood (T. S. Eliot)|\"The Sacred Wood\" (1920)]].<ref>Gallup, Donald. ''T. S. Eliot: A Bibliography (A Revised and Extended Edition)'' Harcourt, Brace & World, New York, 1969. pp. 27\u20138, 204\u20135 (listings A5, C90, C7)</ref> The essay is also available in Eliot's \"Selected Prose\" and \"[[Selected Essays, 1917-1932|Selected Essays]]\".''\n\nWhile Eliot is most often known for his poetry, he also contributed to the field of literary criticism. In this dual role, he acted as poet-critic, comparable to [[Sir Philip Sidney]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\" is one of the more well known works that Eliot produced in his critic capacity. It formulates Eliot's influential conception of the relationship between the poet and preceding literary traditions.Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It can't be inherited and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour. it involves, in the first place, the historical sense, which we may call nearly indispensable to anyone who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty-fifth year ;and the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence...\n\n==Content of the essay==\nThis essay is divided into three parts: first the concept of \"Tradition,\" then the Theory of Impersonal Poetry, and finally the conclusion.\n\nEliot presents his conception of tradition and the definition of the poet and poetry in relation to it. He wishes to correct the fact that, as he perceives it, \"in English writing we seldom speak of tradition, though we occasionally apply its name in deploring its absence.\"  Eliot posits that, though the English tradition generally upholds the belief that art progresses through change \u2013 a separation from tradition, literary advancements are instead recognised only when they conform to the tradition. Eliot, a [[Classics|classicist]], felt that the true incorporation of tradition into literature was unrecognised, that tradition, a word that \"seldom... appear[s] except in a phrase of censure,\" was actually a thus-far unrealised element of literary criticism.\n\nFor Eliot, the term \"tradition\" is imbued with a special and complex character. It represents a \"simultaneous order,\" by which Eliot means a historical timelessness \u2013 a fusion of past and present \u2013 and, at the same time, a sense of present temporality. A poet must embody \"the whole of the literature of Europe from [[Homer]],\" while, simultaneously, expressing their contemporary environment. Eliot challenges the common perception that a poet's greatness and individuality lie in their departure from their predecessors; he argues that \"the most individual parts of his [the poet's] work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.\"  Eliot claims that this \"historical sense\" is not only a resemblance to traditional works but an awareness and understanding of their relation to his poetry.\n\nThis fidelity to tradition, however, does not require the great poet to forfeit novelty in an act of surrender to repetition. Rather, Eliot has a much more dynamic and progressive conception of the poetic process: novelty is possible only through tapping into tradition. When a poet engages in the creation of new work, they realise an aesthetic \"ideal order,\" as it has been established by the literary tradition that has come before them. As such, the act of artistic creation does not take place in a vacuum. The introduction of a new work alters the cohesion of this existing order, and causes a readjustment of the old to accommodate the new. The inclusion of the new work alters the way in which the past is seen; elements of the past that are noted and realised. In Eliot\u2019s own words, \"What happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art that preceded it.\" Eliot refers to this organic tradition, this developing canon, as the \"mind of Europe.\" The private mind is subsumed by this more massive one. \n\nThis leads to Eliot\u2019s so-called \"Impersonal Theory\" of poetry. Since the poet engages in a \"continual surrender of himself\" to the vast order of tradition, artistic creation is a process of depersonalisation. The mature poet is viewed as a medium, through which tradition is channelled and elaborated. They compare the poet to a catalyst in a chemical reaction, in which the reactants are feelings and emotions that are synthesised to create an artistic image that captures and relays these same feelings and emotions. While the mind of the poet is necessary for the production, it emerges unaffected by the process. The artist stores feelings and emotions and properly unites them into a specific combination, which is the artistic product. What lends greatness to a work of art are not the feelings and emotions themselves, but the nature of the artistic process by which they are synthesised. The artist is responsible for creating \"the pressure, so to speak, under which the fusion takes place.\" And, it is the intensity of fusion that renders art great. In this view, Eliot rejects the theory that art expresses metaphysical unity in the soul of the poet. The poet is a depersonalised vessel, a mere medium.\n\nGreat works do not express the personal emotion of the poet. The poet does not reveal their own unique and novel emotions, but rather, by drawing on ordinary ones and channelling them through the intensity of poetry, they express feelings that surpass, altogether, experienced emotion. This is what Eliot intends when he discusses poetry as an \"escape from emotion.\" Since successful poetry is impersonal and, therefore, exists independent of its poet, it outlives the poet and can incorporate into the timeless \"ideal order\" of the \"living\" literary tradition. \n\nAnother essay found in ''Selected Essays'' relates to this notion of the impersonal poet. In \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\" Eliot presents the phrase \"[[objective correlative]].\" The theory is that the expression of emotion in art can be achieved by a specific, and almost formulaic, prescription of a set of objects, including events and situations. A particular emotion is created by presenting its correlated objective sign. The author is depersonalised in this conception, since he is the mere effecter of the sign. And, it is the sign, and not the poet, which creates emotion.\n\nThe implications here separate Eliot's idea of talent from the conventional definition (just as his idea of Tradition is separate from the conventional definition), one so far from it, perhaps, that he chooses never to directly label it as talent. Whereas the conventional definition of talent, especially in the arts, is a genius that one is born with. Not so for Eliot. Instead, talent is acquired through a careful study of poetry, claiming that Tradition, \"cannot be inherited, and if you want it, you must obtain it by great labour.\" Eliot asserts that it is absolutely necessary for the poet to study, to have an understanding of the poets before them, and to be well versed enough that they can understand and incorporate the \"mind of Europe\" into their poetry. But the poet's study is unique \u2013 it is knowledge that \"does not encroach,\" and that does not \"deaden or pervert poetic sensibility.\" It is, to put it most simply, a poetic knowledge \u2013 knowledge observed through a poetic lens. This ideal implies that knowledge gleaned by a poet is not knowledge of facts, but knowledge which leads to a greater understanding of the mind of Europe. As Eliot explains, \"[[Shakespeare]] acquired more essential history from [[Plutarch]] than most men could from the whole [[British Museum]].\"\n\n==Eliot and New Criticism==\nUnwittingly, Eliot inspired and informed the movement of [[New Criticism]]. This is somewhat ironic, since he later criticised their intensely detailed analysis of texts as unnecessarily tedious. Yet, he does share with them the same focus on the aesthetic and stylistic qualities of poetry, rather than on its ideological content.

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J.

Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

One night at a jamboree, McAllister gets drunk and seems nauseated and confused when entering a makeshift brothel behind the gathering.  It turns out that in his inebriated state, he had sex with another man, later revealed to be his sawmill boss, Dewey Barksdale ([[James Best]]).<ref name=\"imdb.com\">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074995/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl</ref><ref name=\"rogerebert.com\">https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ode-to-billy-joe-1976</ref>\n\nAfter his intimate encounter with Barksdale, Billy Joe disappears for several days.  He then returns, and Bobbie Lee finally submits to her passions at a secluded spot near the bridge and encourages him to make love to her.  Owing to his guilt, however, Billy Joe cannot consummate their relationship. He admits to Bobbie Lee that he has been with a man, and when she tries to reason that he was drunk, so maybe didn't have complete control of himself and didn't really know what was going on, he confesses that he knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong, and did it anyway because he wanted to.  Tearfully, he bids her an enigmatic goodbye, and subsequently kills himself by jumping off the bridge spanning the [[Tallahatchie River]]. The local preacher, who saw Billy Joe and Bobbie Lee together, and other townsfolk spread the false story that Billy Joe committed suicide because he learned he had impregnated Bobbie Lee out of wedlock. For the sake of the family, Bobbie Lee's brother insists that she either quietly pursue an abortion or, if she insists upon having the baby, leave town.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/><ref name=\"rogerebert.com\"/>\n\nIn the film, as in the novel, the object thrown from the bridge is Bobbie Lee's ragdoll, symbolizing throwing away her childhood and innocence and becoming an adult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa|url-access=registration|quote=Ode to billy joe ragdoll.|title=Men Like That: A Southern Queer History |author=John Howard |page=[https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa/page/349 349] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226354705 |access-date=28 March 2019|date=December 1999 }}</ref>\n\nKnowing that no one will ever believe that she and Billy Joe did not have sex and that she was never pregnant, Bobbie Lee decides to leave home.  Very early one morning, with suitcase in hand, she walks to town to get a bus.  On the way she meets Barksdale on the bridge, where he tells her that he is headed to her house to confess to her father and clear her name.  She advises him against doing so, noting that revealing the truth would forever tarnish Billy Joe's reputation.  He initially holds fast to his desire to confess, but Bobbie Lee calmly stresses that the news would further devastate Billy Joe's family and leave Barksdale himself subject to criminal prosecution.  She also assures him that she does not mind her fate and then adds, \"Oh, I'll be back before long; I'm only 15. What do I know of the world?\"  Finally agreeing with the girl's logic, he offers Bobbie Lee a ride to the bus station, which she graciously accepts.  The film ends with the two of them walking across the bridge together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robby Benson]] as Billy Joe McAllister\n* [[Glynnis O'Connor]] as Bobbie Lee Hartley\n* [[Joan Hotchkis]] as Anna 'Mama' Hartley\n* [[Sandy McPeak]] as Glenn 'Papa' Hartley\n* [[James Best]] as Dewey Barksdale\n* Terence Goodman as James Hartley\n* Becky Bowen as Becky Thompson\n* Simpson Hemphill as Brother Taylor\n* Ed Shelnut as Coleman Stroud\n* Eddie Talr as Tom Hargitay\n* William Hallberg as Dan McAllister\n* Rebecca Jernigan as Mrs Thompson\n\n==Production==\nThe June 12, 1975 issue of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced the completion of a $3.5 million deal between Max Baer, Jr. and Warner Bros.

His novelization of the story, published the year of the film's release as a [[movie tie-in]], used the same rationale for the suicide.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in 1953, the film explores the budding relationship between teenagers Billy Joe McAllister (Benson) and Bobbie Lee Hartley (O'Connor) (who corresponds to the unnamed narrator of the original song), despite resistance from Hartley's family, who contend she is too young to date. One night at a jamboree, McAllister gets drunk and seems nauseated and confused when entering a makeshift brothel behind the gathering.  It turns out that in his inebriated state, he had sex with another man, later revealed to be his sawmill boss, Dewey Barksdale ([[James Best]]).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074995/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl</ref><ref>https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ode-to-billy-joe-1976</ref>\n\nAfter his intimate encounter with Barksdale, Billy Joe disappears for several days.  He then returns, and Bobbie Lee finally submits to her passions at a secluded spot near the bridge and encourages him to make love to her.  Owing to his guilt, however, Billy Joe cannot consummate their relationship. He admits to Bobbie Lee that he has been with a man, and when she tries to reason that he was drunk, so maybe didn't have complete control of himself and didn't really know what was going on, he confesses that he knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong, and did it anyway because he wanted to.  Tearfully, he bids her an enigmatic goodbye, and subsequently kills himself by jumping off the bridge spanning the [[Tallahatchie River]]. The local preacher, who saw Billy Joe and Bobbie Lee together, and other townsfolk spread the false story that Billy Joe committed suicide because he learned he had impregnated Bobbie Lee out of wedlock. For the sake of the family, Bobbie Lee's brother insists that she either quietly pursue an abortion or, if she insists upon having the baby, leave town.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074995/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl</ref><ref>https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ode-to-billy-joe-1976</ref>\n\nIn the film, as in the novel, the object thrown from the bridge is Bobbie Lee's ragdoll, symbolizing throwing away her childhood and innocence and becoming an adult.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa|url-access=registration|quote=Ode to billy joe ragdoll.|title=Men Like That: A Southern Queer History |author=John Howard |page=[https://archive.org/details/menlikethatsouth00howa/page/349 349] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226354705 |access-date=28 March 2019|date=December 1999 }}</ref>\n\nKnowing that no one will ever believe that she and Billy Joe did not have sex and that she was never pregnant, Bobbie Lee decides to leave home.  Very early one morning, with suitcase in hand, she walks to town to get a bus.  On the way she meets Barksdale on the bridge, where he tells her that he is headed to her house to confess to her father and clear her name.  She advises him against doing so, noting that revealing the truth would forever tarnish Billy Joe's reputation.  He initially holds fast to his desire to confess, but Bobbie Lee calmly stresses that the news would further devastate Billy Joe's family and leave Barksdale himself subject to criminal prosecution.  She also assures him that she does not mind her fate and then adds, \"Oh, I'll be back before long; I'm only 15. What do I know of the world?\"  Finally agreeing with the girl's logic, he offers Bobbie Lee a ride to the bus station, which she graciously accepts.  The film ends with the two of them walking across the bridge together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robby Benson]] as Billy Joe McAllister\n* [[Glynnis O'Connor]] as Bobbie Lee Hartley\n* [[Joan Hotchkis]] as Anna 'Mama' Hartley\n* [[Sandy McPeak]] as Glenn 'Papa' Hartley\n* [[James Best]] as Dewey Barksdale\n* Terence Goodman as James Hartley\n* Becky Bowen as Becky Thompson\n* Simpson Hemphill as Brother Taylor\n* Ed Shelnut as Coleman Stroud\n* Eddie Talr as Tom Hargitay\n* William Hallberg as Dan McAllister\n* Rebecca Jernigan as Mrs Thompson\n\n==Production==\nThe June 12, 1975 issue of the ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced the completion of a $3.5 million deal between Max Baer, Jr. and Warner Bros.

These instances are termed as \"false positives\". However, the \"presence of false positives alone does not indicate overdiagnosis\". There may be evidence of overdiagnosis if inaccuracies are shown consistently in the accepted prevalence rates or in the diagnostic process itself. \"For ADHD to be overdiagnosed, the rate of false positives (i.e., children inappropriately diagnosed with ADHD) must substantially exceed the number of false negatives (children with ADHD who are not identified or diagnosed).\"<ref name=\"Sciutto, M.

The prevalence of ADHD dramatically varies across cultures despite the fact that the same methodology has been used. Some believe this may be due to different perceptions of what qualifies as disruptive behavior, inattention and hyperactivity.<ref name=\"Cuffe, S. P. 2005\">{{cite journal |last1= Cuffe |first1= SP |last2= Moore |first2= CG |last3= McKeown |first3= RE |year= 2005 |title= Prevalence and correlates of ADHD symptoms in the National Health Interview Survey |journal= Journal of Attention Disorders |volume= 9 |issue= 2 |pages= 392\u2013401 |doi=10.1177/1087054705280413|pmid= 16371662 }}</ref>\n\nIt is argued that over-diagnosis occurs more in well-off or more homogeneous communities, whereas under-diagnosis occurs more frequently in poorer and minority communities due to lack of resources and lack of financial access. Those without health insurance are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. It is further believed that the \"distribution of ADHD diagnosis falls along socioeconomic lines\", according to the amount of wealth within a neighborhood. Therefore, the difficulty of applying national, general guidelines to localized and specific contexts, such as where referral is unavailable, resources are lacking or the patient is uninsured, may assist in the establishment of a misdiagnosis of ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Morely |first= CP |year= 2010 |title= Disparities in ADHD assessment, diagnosis and treatment |journal= International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine |volume= 40 |issue= 4 |pages= 383\u20139|pmid= 21391409 |doi= 10.2190/PM.40.4.b |url= https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29b1b3dc18f2fd835e620e8a1575878b9cb0c751 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment can also influence perception of relevant ADHD symptoms. ADHD is viewed as a chronic disorder that develops in childhood and continues into adulthood. However, some research shows a decline in the symptoms of ADHD as children grow up and mature into adulthood. As children move into the stage of adolescence, the most common reporters of ADHD symptoms, parents and teachers, tend to focus on behaviors affecting academic performance. Some research has shown that the primary symptoms of ADHD were strong discriminators in parent ratings, but differed for specific age groups. Hyperactivity was a stronger discriminator of ADHD in children, while inattentiveness was a stronger discriminator in adolescents.<ref name=\"Harrison, J. R. 2011\">{{cite journal |last1= Harrison |first1= JR |last2= Vannest |first2= KJ |last3= Reynolds |first3= CR |year= 2011 |title= Behaviors that discriminate ADHD in children and adolescents: Primary symptoms, symptoms of comorbid conditions or indicators of functional impairment? |journal= Journal of Attention Disorders |volume= 15 |issue= 2 |pages= 147\u201360 |doi=10.1177/1087054709356170|pmid= 20354233 }}</ref>\n\nIssues with comorbidity is another possible explanation in favor of the argument of overdiagnosis. As many as 75% of diagnosed children with ADHD meet criteria for some other psychiatric diagnosis.<ref name=\"Cuffe, S.

R. 2011\"/> Learning disorders are found in 20% to 40% of children with ADHD.<ref name=\"Cuffe, S. P. 2005\"/>\n\nAnother possible explanation of over-diagnosis of ADHD is the \"relative-age effect\", which applies to children of both sexes. Younger children are more likely to be inappropriately diagnosed with ADHD and treated with prescription medication than their older peers in the same grade. Children who are almost a year younger tend to appear more immature than their classmates, which influences both their academic and athletic performance.<ref name=CMAJ>{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=R |last2=Garland |first2= J |last3= Wright |first3= J |last4= Maclure |first4= M |last5= Taylor |first5= S |last6= Dormuth |first6= C |displayauthors= 4 |title=Influence of relative age on diagnosis and treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in children|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=17 April 2012|volume=184|issue=7|pages=755\u201362|doi=10.1503/cmaj.111619 |pmid=22392937 |pmc=3328520}}</ref>\n\nThe debate of underdiagnosis, or giving a \"false negative\", has also been discussed, specifically in literature concerning ADHD among adults, girls and underprivileged communities.

These instances are termed as \"false positives\". However, the \"presence of false positives alone does not indicate overdiagnosis\". There may be evidence of overdiagnosis if inaccuracies are shown consistently in the accepted prevalence rates or in the diagnostic process itself. \"For ADHD to be overdiagnosed, the rate of false positives (i.e., children inappropriately diagnosed with ADHD) must substantially exceed the number of false negatives (children with ADHD who are not identified or diagnosed).\"<ref name=\"Sciutto, M.

The prevalence of ADHD dramatically varies across cultures despite the fact that the same methodology has been used. Some believe this may be due to different perceptions of what qualifies as disruptive behavior, inattention and hyperactivity.<ref name=\"Cuffe, S.

Those without health insurance are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. It is further believed that the \"distribution of ADHD diagnosis falls along socioeconomic lines\", according to the amount of wealth within a neighborhood. Therefore, the difficulty of applying national, general guidelines to localized and specific contexts, such as where referral is unavailable, resources are lacking or the patient is uninsured, may assist in the establishment of a misdiagnosis of ADHD.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Morely |first= CP |year= 2010 |title= Disparities in ADHD assessment, diagnosis and treatment |journal= International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine |volume= 40 |issue= 4 |pages= 383\u20139|pmid= 21391409 |doi= 10.2190/PM.40.4.b |url= https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29b1b3dc18f2fd835e620e8a1575878b9cb0c751 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment can also influence perception of relevant ADHD symptoms. ADHD is viewed as a chronic disorder that develops in childhood and continues into adulthood. However, some research shows a decline in the symptoms of ADHD as children grow up and mature into adulthood. As children move into the stage of adolescence, the most common reporters of ADHD symptoms, parents and teachers, tend to focus on behaviors affecting academic performance. Some research has shown that the primary symptoms of ADHD were strong discriminators in parent ratings, but differed for specific age groups. Hyperactivity was a stronger discriminator of ADHD in children, while inattentiveness was a stronger discriminator in adolescents.<ref name=\"Harrison, J. R. 2011\">{{cite journal |last1= Harrison |first1= JR |last2= Vannest |first2= KJ |last3= Reynolds |first3= CR |year= 2011 |title= Behaviors that discriminate ADHD in children and adolescents: Primary symptoms, symptoms of comorbid conditions or indicators of functional impairment? |journal= Journal of Attention Disorders |volume= 15 |issue= 2 |pages= 147\u201360 |doi=10.1177/1087054709356170|pmid= 20354233 }}</ref>\n\nIssues with comorbidity is another possible explanation in favor of the argument of overdiagnosis. As many as 75% of diagnosed children with ADHD meet criteria for some other psychiatric diagnosis.<ref name=\"Cuffe, S.

R. 2011\"/> Learning disorders are found in 20% to 40% of children with ADHD.<ref name=\"Cuffe, S. P. 2005\"/>\n\nAnother possible explanation of over-diagnosis of ADHD is the \"relative-age effect\", which applies to children of both sexes. Younger children are more likely to be inappropriately diagnosed with ADHD and treated with prescription medication than their older peers in the same grade. Children who are almost a year younger tend to appear more immature than their classmates, which influences both their academic and athletic performance.<ref name=CMAJ>{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=R |last2=Garland |first2= J |last3= Wright |first3= J |last4= Maclure |first4= M |last5= Taylor |first5= S |last6= Dormuth |first6= C |displayauthors= 4 |title=Influence of relative age on diagnosis and treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in children|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=17 April 2012|volume=184|issue=7|pages=755\u201362|doi=10.1503/cmaj.111619 |pmid=22392937 |pmc=3328520}}</ref>\n\nThe debate of underdiagnosis, or giving a \"false negative\", has also been discussed, specifically in literature concerning ADHD among adults, girls and underprivileged communities.

He continued his piano studies in Cambridge while studying art history at [[Harvard University]]. He became interested in the harpsichord at Harvard and gave his first harpsichord recital there in 1930. After graduating in 1931, he traveled to Europe on a John Knowles Paine Fellowship. He studied with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and harpsichord revival pioneer [[Wanda Landowska]] in Paris, with [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in [[Haslemere]], [[Heinz Tiessen]] in [[Berlin]], and [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in [[Leipzig]]. In January 1933 he made his European debut in Berlin performing [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''. In the summers of 1933 and 1934 he taught at the [[Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. A Guggenheim Fellowship awarded in 1936 enabled him to study seventeenth- and eighteenth-century manuscripts and sources in Europe. In 1938 he inaugurated a festival of Baroque music at the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia and continued as adviser and principal performer for a number of years. \n\nIn 1938, G. Schirmer, NY. published his edition of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'',  which includes extensive discussion of ornamentation, fingering, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], tempo, dynamics, and general interpretation.\n\nFrom 1940-1976 he was a professor at [[Yale University]].  He published his biography of [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and a critical edition of 60 sonatas by Scarlatti in 1953. Scarlatti's sonatas are now conventionally designated by their '''Kirkpatrick numbers''' (shown as Kk. --, and more recently with a single K.), which is now considered the standard, authoritative numbering system for these works (despite at least two rival systems)<ref>{{cite book|last=Halford|first=Margery|title=Scarlatti -- An Introduction to His Keyboard Works|date=1974|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|location=Van Nuys, CA|isbn=978-0739022153|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YmH3z0d1qoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> (see [[opus number]] and [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti]]).\n\nDuring the 1960s Kirkpatrick made recordings of the complete harpsichord works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (Archiv). The instrument he used for many of these recordings was always one or other of the contemporary harpsichords being made at the time by the firm of JC Neupert of [[Bamberg]]. These days such instruments are called \"revival\" style instruments, their features including 'inauthentic' metal frames and robust, heavy construction. These recordings show Kirkpatrick's formidable keyboard technique to full advantage,  and, unusually for recordings of the time, he observes almost all of the repeats. His performances of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' were recorded on both the [[harpsichord]] and the [[clavichord]]. His later Bach recordings used a reproduction French harpsichord by Hubbard & Dowd.\n\nAs a performer and recording artist, he became best known for his harpsichord performances of the keyboard music of Bach and Scarlatti, but he also performed and recorded works by Rameau, Couperin, Handel,  Byrd, and Purcell.  He recorded on the clavichord (e.g. Bach's two- and three-part inventions, as well as both volumes of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'') and on the [[fortepiano]] (especially works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]).  He recalled playing a clavichord at a [[house concert]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].<ref>Ralph Kirkpatrick, \"On Playing the Clavichord,\" ''Early Music'', Vol. 9, No. 3, Wind Issue (Jul., 1981), pp. 293-305 (Oxford University Press).

Both the Carter and Cowell pieces were inspired by Kirkpatrick and dedicated to him. He also performed and recorded the Manuel de Falla Harpsichord Concerto and played the piano in a recording of the Stravinsky Septet.  \n\nIn addition to his biography of Scarlatti, he was the author of ''Interpreting Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier: A Performer's Discourse of Method'' which was published posthumously by Yale University in 1984. Meredith Kirkpatrick edited several books of the writings of Ralph Kirkpatrick entitled  ''Ralph Kirkpatrick: Letters of the American Harpsichordist and Scholar'' (University of Rochester Press, 2014) and ''Reflections of an American Harpsichordist: Unpublished Memoirs, Essays, and Lectures of Ralph Kirkpatrick'' (University of Rochester Press, 2017).  \n\nKirkpatrick died in [[Guilford, Connecticut]] at the age of 72.\n\nOn April 2, 1999, the asteroid [[9902 Kirkpatrick]] is named in his honor.\n\nHis brother, {{Interlanguage link|Clifford Kirkpatrick|fr||WD=}} (1898-1971), was a sociologist.

In the summers of 1933 and 1934 he taught at the [[Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. A Guggenheim Fellowship awarded in 1936 enabled him to study seventeenth- and eighteenth-century manuscripts and sources in Europe. In 1938 he inaugurated a festival of Baroque music at the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia and continued as adviser and principal performer for a number of years. \n\nIn 1938, G. Schirmer, NY. published his edition of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations'',  which includes extensive discussion of ornamentation, fingering, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], tempo, dynamics, and general interpretation.\n\nFrom 1940-1976 he was a professor at [[Yale University]].  He published his biography of [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and a critical edition of 60 sonatas by Scarlatti in 1953. Scarlatti's sonatas are now conventionally designated by their '''Kirkpatrick numbers''' (shown as Kk. --, and more recently with a single K.), which is now considered the standard, authoritative numbering system for these works (despite at least two rival systems)<ref>{{cite book|last=Halford|first=Margery|title=Scarlatti -- An Introduction to His Keyboard Works|date=1974|publisher=Alfred Music Publishing|location=Van Nuys, CA|isbn=978-0739022153|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YmH3z0d1qoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> (see [[opus number]] and [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti]]).\n\nDuring the 1960s Kirkpatrick made recordings of the complete harpsichord works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (Archiv). The instrument he used for many of these recordings was always one or other of the contemporary harpsichords being made at the time by the firm of JC Neupert of [[Bamberg]]. These days such instruments are called \"revival\" style instruments, their features including 'inauthentic' metal frames and robust, heavy construction. These recordings show Kirkpatrick's formidable keyboard technique to full advantage,  and, unusually for recordings of the time, he observes almost all of the repeats. His performances of ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' were recorded on both the [[harpsichord]] and the [[clavichord]]. His later Bach recordings used a reproduction French harpsichord by Hubbard & Dowd.\n\nAs a performer and recording artist, he became best known for his harpsichord performances of the keyboard music of Bach and Scarlatti, but he also performed and recorded works by Rameau, Couperin, Byrd, and Purcell.  He recorded on the clavichord (e.g. Bach's two- and three-part inventions, as well as both volumes of ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'') and on the [[fortepiano]] (especially works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]).  He recalled playing a clavichord at a [[house concert]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].<ref>Ralph Kirkpatrick, \"On Playing the Clavichord,\" ''Early Music'', Vol. 9, No. 3, Wind Issue (Jul., 1981), pp. 293-305 (Oxford University Press).

Both the Carter and Cowell pieces were inspired by Kirkpatrick and dedicated to him. \n\nIn addition to his biography of Scarlatti, he was the author of ''Interpreting Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier: A Performer's Discourse of Method'' which was published posthumously by Yale University in 1984. Meredith Kirkpatrick edited several books of the writings of Ralph Kirkpatrick entitled  ''Ralph Kirkpatrick: Letters of the American Harpsichordist and Scholar'' (University of Rochester Press, 2014) and ''Reflections of an American Harpsichordist: Unpublished Memoirs, Essays, and Lectures of Ralph Kirkpatrick'' (University of Rochester Press, 2017).  \n\nKirkpatrick died in [[Guilford, Connecticut]] at the age of 72.\n\nOn April 2, 1999, the asteroid [[9902 Kirkpatrick]] is named in his honor.\n\nHis brother, {{Interlanguage link|Clifford Kirkpatrick|fr||WD=}} (1898-1971), was a sociologist.

main divisions of the [[Federal Art Project]] (FAP) was originally conceived by Reeves and [[Romana Javitz]], the curator of the Picture Collection at the [[New York Public Library]], as a way for the American artist to find authentic American everyday objects to use as visual references for their work. The Index was established with the FAP in January 1936  with Reeves as its national supervisor. She held the position until the spring when Adolph Cook Glassgold replaced her. Within the Index, [[Shakers|Shaker]] works were highly prized as Reeves felt they emphasized the art of the American common man.<ref name=\"isbn0-89468-295-4\"/><ref>{{Cite book|title = Kentucky by Design: The Decorative Arts and American Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DgZ2CQAAQBAJ|publisher = University Press of Kentucky|date = 2015-05-26|isbn = 9780813155692|first = Andrew|last = Kelly}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The New Deal fine arts projects : a bibliography, 1933-1992|url = https://archive.org/stream/newdealfineartsp00kalf#page/n45/mode/2up/search/reeves|website = archive.org|accessdate = 2015-12-29|date = 1994|publisher = Scarecrow Press|last = Kalfatovic|first = Martin R.}}</ref>\n\nShe later taught at the [[Cooper Union|Cooper Union Art School]] in New York.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Twentieth-Century Pattern Design|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c93jEZwcfPoC|publisher = Princeton Architectural Press|date = 2007-02-08|isbn = 9781568987125|first = Lesley|last = Jackson}}</ref> She married engineer Donald Robert Baker and had three daughters.

''South Mountain'' is one of her earliest narrative pieces designed as an autobiographical family portrait. It was named after the road she lived on in the artist colony in [[New City, New York]]. This piece was the start of her \"personal prints\" that were privately commissioned limited editions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1930, Reeve was commissioned by the [[W. & J.

The company neglected to check in on her progress and in the end were horrified at the unconventional fabric she designed. Each pattern was printed on twenty-nine different types of cotton and depicted a series of rooms in an imaginary house. The fabrics also didn't sell and the relationship ended unhappily. The most notable work from this collection is \"American Scene,\" a panorama that celebrates everyday American life: work, sports, and family.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Women Designers in the USA, 1900-2000: Diversity and Difference : Jacqueline M.
