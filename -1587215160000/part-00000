Situated at the top of a sea cliff, it was originally a [[promontory fort]] converted into a [[motte-and-bailey]] in the 12th century. In the 15th century a tower house was built by the [[Lords of the Isles]], which later passed into the hands of the Kennedy family.<ref name=castles>{{cite web|url=http://www.castlesfortsbattles.co.uk/central_west_scotland/greenan_castle.html|title=Greenan Castle - Argyll, Clyde and Ayrshire - Castles, Forts and Battles|website=www.castlesfortsbattles.co.uk|accessdate=23 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe lands of Greenan were forfeited by [[John MacDonald II, Lord of the Isles|John, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles]] in 1476 for treason against [[James III of Scotland|James III]]. In 1493 [[james IV of Scotland|James IV]] granted the Lands of Greenan to William Douglas, son of [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus|Archibald, Earl of Angus]].\n\nThe first known defensive structure on the site was a promontory fort,  probably a fortified farmstead, enclosing around {{convert|1|acre}}. Four concentric curved ditches, each around {{convert|3|m}} wide, cut off the headland with the exception of a single causeway to provide access. It is not known how long this settlement was occupied, but the site was re-used in the twelfth century.<ref name=castles/>\n\nBeside the tower are traces of a walled courtyard and outbuildings\u2014probably stables and a kitchen block, as the small tower has no kitchen within its walls. In this courtyard on the morning of 12 May 1602, Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean and his servant, Lancelot Kennedy, mounted their horses to ride to [[Edinburgh]], having spent the night before with Thomas's half-brother, John Kennedy of Baltersan. Just a few miles away in the woods of St Leonards (now a suburb of Ayr), they were ambushed by Thomas Kennedy (of Drummurchie), Thomas Kennedy (brother to the [[Gilbert Kennedy of Bargany and Ardstinchar|Laird of Bargany]]), Walter Muir of Cloncaird, Thomas M'Alexander, Thomas Wallace, a boy called Gilbert Ramsay and a borderer, Williame Irrwing. Sir Thomas was murdered in retaliation for the death of the young Laird of Bargany in December, 1601 at the [[Battle of Brockloch]], near [[Maybole]]. Years later, the Muirs of Auchindrain (father and son) were executed for their \"art and part\" in this murder. The story inspired [[Sir Walter Scott]] to write a short play, \"An Ayrshire Tragedy\".\n\nThe castle passed through various members of the clan before ending up in the hands of Thomas Kennedy, [[Marquess of Ailsa|Earl of Cassillis]] in 1766.

Released in 2009, it was developed by [[Related Designs]], produced by [[Blue Byte]], and published by [[Ubisoft]]. ''Anno 1404'' is the sequel to ''[[Anno 1701]]'' and is followed by the futuristic sequel ''[[Anno 2070]]''. Though the game centers on a series of fictional events, the overall concept of the storyline is based upon real life aspects of [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] history such as the [[Crusades]], advancements in [[gothic architecture]], construction of [[cathedral]]s, and [[Hanseatic League|hanseatic]] trade involving the rise of [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] merchants and early forms of [[capitalism]].\n\nAn expansion, titled ''Anno 1404: Venice'', which adds multiplayer and other features, was released on February 26, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/5181026566/m/7331069608 |title=Ubisoft Announces ANNO 1404 Venice The Official ANNO 1404 Add On |publisher=wifial1404Forums.ubi.com |accessdate=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414004401/http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/5181026566/m/7331069608 |archive-date=2011-04-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2019}}\nAs with other Anno games, the player, at the will of their unnamed country of origin creates and manages their [[fief]] aside [[AI]] players. The player must colonize islands, plan settlements, set up factories and farms to meet their citizens' needs, enter diplomatic relationships with AI players, and engage in naval and ground combat with others.\n\nOne of the main focuses of the game in the \"city building setting\" sense centers on the construction of monuments, namely a Gothic cathedral and an Arabic mosque. The construction phases of these monuments are dependent on certain preconditions which have to be met in order to continue building. The player also needs to stockpile building material in order to commence such a project. The process of the construction of the cathedral resembles very closely the castle/palace (and Asian Dragon Temple) feature that was displayed in ''1404''{{'}}s predecessor, ''[[Anno 1701]]''.\n\nTrade is an essential element of forward progress. Occidental populations can not grow past a certain level of success without Spice, and later Quartz, that can only be generated in Oriental lands. Although populations generate taxable income, it is difficult to generate enough gold to make meaningful capital investments without extensive trading. This is simplified by an automatic trading process that allows an island to make resources available to visiting merchant ships.\n\nAs players progress through the game, they gain access to naval vessels and troops which allow them to invade and ultimately to defeat other players. ''Anno 1404'' features an updated interface, bigger islands and worlds to explore, a [[Sandbox game#Sandbox mode|sandbox mode]] and other features new to the Anno series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Maarten|title=GC 2008: ANNO Goes Back In Time, ''ANNO 1404'' Announced|publisher=[[Shacknews]]|date=2008-08-20|accessdate=2008-08-21|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54275| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820225928/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54275| archivedate= 20 August 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n=== New features ===\nAnno 1404 has several new features that distinguish it from its three predecessors: ''[[Anno 1503]]'', ''[[Anno 1602]]'', and ''[[Anno 1701]]''. These features include:\n\n==== Occident and Orient ====\nAs was the case in ''[[Anno 1701]]'', the game world is divided into two culturally distinct zones. In Anno 1404, these zones are inspired by, though not intended to be historically accurate to, northwestern Renaissance Europe and the medieval Near East, referred to as the Occident and the Orient respectively. One of the major differences between previous entries in the series and Anno 1404 is that players are required to build both occidental and oriental settlements simultaneously in order for the inhabitants of their settlements and available buildings to advance. Despite the addition of player-managed oriental settlements, the Occident remains the primary focus of the game. The Orient acts more of a trading partner in order for Occidental people to advance in class. In order for this to occur, Oriental goods such as [[spice]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and [[quartz]] must be produced and shipped from Oriental colonies.\n\n==== Housing levels ====\nThere are a total of six levels of housing including both occidental and oriental settlements (one more than the levels included in [[Anno 1701]]). The four occidental levels are [[peasants]], [[citizens]], [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s and [[noblemen]]. The two oriental levels are [[nomads]] and envoys. In the Occident, the player starts by building peasant housing, and in the orient, the players start by building nomad housing, both of which advance when conditions are met. These conditions include the acquisition of goods as mentioned above, as well as the construction of specific buildings, such as a debtors' prison, bath house or a cathedral.\n\n==== Civilization class ratios ====\nIn ''[[Anno 1701]]'', every residential structure could be advanced to the uppermost class, so a city could be entirely made up of Aristocrats by the end of a game. In Anno 1404, a number of peasants are required to support a moderate amount of citizens who in turn support a number patricians and noblemen. There are several other factors that can impact the ratio of lower class to upper class, however.  For instance, the number of envoys settled in the player's oriental settlements will satisfy a sum of the peasants and citizens required to support patricians and noblemen in occidental settlements.\n\n==== New goods ====\nSince the game takes place in the year 1404, the range of goods available is significantly different from the goods available in the previous games, which took place later in history (although goods like [[fish]] and [[beer]] were retained from the previous installments). Some of the new goods include [[spices]], [[bread]], [[meat]], [[candlesticks]], leather jerkins, and [[brocade]] robes for the Occident and [[date (fruit)|date]]s, [[milk]], [[carpets]], [[pearl]] [[necklaces]], and [[marzipan]] for the Orient.\n\n==== Quests ====\nAlthough quests are not new to Anno 1404, both it and its expansion, 'Anno 1404: Venice,' feature far more quests than previous games in the series. Quests are given at different intervals to the player by neutral powers, mentors like Northburgh and Al Zahir, and from various people living in the player's settlements. Computer opponents, if they become allies through diplomacy, will also offer quests to the player. Quests offer rewards such as honour points, ships, gold, goods or upgrades for settlements or ships (such as items to boost goods production in a settlement or increase the firepower of a ship). There are several quest types, including fetch quests, reverse fetch quests, sinking enemy ships, or finding specific individuals in a settlement (a mini game similar to [[Where's Waldo]]). Some of these quests can be quite complicated, with multiple smaller quests in the chain. The 'Anno 1404: Venice' expansion adds 300 new quests and two new types of quests: trading race and ship boarding.\n\n=== Achievements ===\n''Anno 1404'' and its add-on Venice add the possibility of rewarding achievements to the player. Those achievements can be seen as 'milestones' and vary from quite easy to extremely hard, since a lot of them are 'hidden'. The achievements are divided in 5 categories: diplomacy, setup, economic, military and general. Quite a few of the achievements are interlinked, being part of another 'bigger' achievement. In the base game there were 206 achievements to be had, the Venice expansion added another 110 of them, totalling 316.\nHowever, as of patch 2.1/1.3 not all achievements are reachable, as syntax errors in the games' xml files are still present. Trying to correct these game files will result in the achievement not being awarded as the game recognises this as modification. This has been addressed by an unofficial user-made patch, about which see below.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Anno1404 screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|''Anno 1404'' partly takes place in the [[Orient]].]]\n\nThe campaign begins when the player is sent to administer a [[fief]] granted to him by the Emperor, in the [[Western world|Occident]]. The Emperor is unwell and Lord Richard Northburgh, cousin and treasurer of the Emperor, is building a magnificent [[Cathedral]] to pray for the Emperor's health. Meanwhile, Cardinal Lucius is making preparations for a [[Crusade]] against the [[Saracen]]s of the [[Orient]], aided by Guy Forcas.\n\nIn the first few chapters of the campaign, the player learns the basics of game-play and the economy by assisting Northburgh and Forcas with supply and construction tasks, as well as meeting some of the other main characters.\n\nAs the [[Crusades|Crusader]] ships leave the harbor, Northburgh begins to uncover clues to a mysterious plot. He and the player travel to the [[Orient]] and befriend the [[Grand Vizier]] of the Sultan, Al Zahir, who helps the player to defeat a band of [[Barbary corsairs|Corsairs]] and break up a child trafficking scheme. The plot thickens as further clues reveal that a main character is implicated in a sinister conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor himself. Because he comes too close to the truth, Lord Northburgh is captured and the player is tasked with unraveling the mystery.\n\nOver the next several chapters, the player must win over new allies, convince the leaders of the Crusade that they are being manipulated under false pretenses, and survive dire circumstances in order to defeat the villains and restore the Emperor to his rightful place.\n\nThe campaign is divided into eight chapters and each chapter can be played on 3 different difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. Apart from the story elements, the campaign serves as a tutorial to prepare the player for the more rigorous scenarios and continuous game modes.\n\nAll of the main characters encountered in the campaign are also encountered in the scenarios mode and can be selected as computer opponents in continuous games, although the actions of the characters during the campaign are unrelated to their actions in these modes apart from having similar personalities. Lord Northburgh and Al Zahir act as mentors and trade partners in the other modes, much like they do in the campaign.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Digital rights management ===\nThe game has a rigorous [[digital rights management]] (DRM) system based on [[Tag\u00e8s]]. It forces users to activate their game online once by submitting an activation code after each installation on a different computer or a significant hardware change. The activation can be performed on any PC with an Internet connection. It can only be activated three times by default and unlike many other DRM systems, it does not support revocation of already used licenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesprotection.com/activation.htm#revoke |title=Activation |publisher=Tagesprotection.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref> Further licenses can be requested free of charge by contacting Ubisoft.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ubisoft |url=http://anno.uk.ubi.com/pc/faq-tages.php |title=The Official ANNO 1404 Copy Protection FAQs &#124; ANNO Portal &#124; Ubisoft |publisher=Anno.uk.ubi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>\n\nThe copy protection has been completely removed with patch v1.1 for the DVD version.

On November 25, 2010, a third patch was released to address (among other things) a serious save game bug, patching the base game to version 1.3 and the 'Venice' expansion to version 2.1. The 'Gold' version of the game that includes both the original game and the 'Venice' expansion was also patched in November 2010 to version 3.1, which combines all the changes of the version 1.3 patch of the base game, and version 2.1 of 'Venice'.\n\nUbisoft never released North American patches for the final version 1.3 patch for the base game and the version 2.1 patch for ''Dawn of Discovery: Venice''. However, the North American game can be manually patched to version 1.3 and version 2.1 by simply downloading the already unpacked European patch files.<ref>{{cite web|title=PATCH DoD 1.3 and Venice 2.1 File Download|publisher=Steam User Forums|author=Brumbek|date=2011-10-13|accessdate=2011-10-21|url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2115188}}</ref>\n\nAn [[unofficial patch|unofficial user-made patch]] (version 1.10 as of February 2013) was made available in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=[PATCH] Anno 1404/DoD: Venice Unofficial Patch!|publisher=Steam User Forums |author=Brumbek |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2013-04-22|url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2271596}}</ref> The patch addresses issues with broken quests, fixes spelling and grammar errors, adds proper English localizations, adds English translations for over 1,000 quests which only had description text in the German version, and fixes countless other issues.

The Venice expansion also allows the player to play the original 6 scenarios of the base game but with all the added features and improvements of the Venice addon.\n\nMany new buildings were added:\n* A multi-part personal mansion\n* New ornamental buildings such as Saint Mark's pillar\n\nTwo new quest type were added: ship race and privateering.\n\nFurthermore, the player now has the option of requesting a quest in order to gain more honour points and/or gold coins/goods.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dawnofdiscoverygame.us.ubi.com/pc Official US site]\n*[http://anno.uk.ubi.com/pc Official UK site]\n\n{{Anno series}}\n\n[[Category:Fiction set in the 1400s]]\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Age of Discovery video games]]\n[[Category:Anno (series)]]\n[[Category:City-building games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Real-time strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Germany]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 15th century]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n[[Category:Blue Byte games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2009 city-building game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Anno 1404\n|image = Anno 1404.jpg\n|developer = [[Related Designs]]<br/> [[Blue Byte]]\n|publisher = [[Ubisoft]]\n|composer = David Christiansen<br/>([[Dynamedion]]) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamedion.de/english/trackrecord/videogames |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130031408/http://www.dynamedion.de/english/trackrecord/videogames |archivedate=2009-01-30 }}</ref>\n|engine = \n|series = ''[[Anno (series)|Anno]]''\n|released = {{vgrelease|EU|June 25, 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=62042|title=Worthplaying - 'Dawn of Discovery' (NDS/Wii/PC) Gets Euro Release Date|work=WorthPlaying}}</ref>}}{{vgrelease|NA|June 23, 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=7690|title=Ubisoft|work=ubi.com}}</ref>}}\n|genre = [[City-building game|City-building]], [[Business simulation game|business simulation]], [[real-time strategy]]\n|modes = [[Single-player]], [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]\n|platforms = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n}}\n\n'''''Anno 1404''''', known as '''''Dawn of Discovery''''' in North America, is a [[city-building game|city-building]] and [[Business simulation game|economic simulation game]] with [[real-time strategy]] elements, part of the [[Anno (series)|''Anno'' series]].

The player also needs to stockpile building material in order to commence such a project. The process of the construction of the cathedral resembles very closely the castle/palace (and Asian Dragon Temple) feature that was displayed in ''1404''{{'}}s predecessor, ''[[Anno 1701]]''.\n\nTrade is an essential element of forward progress. Occidental populations can not grow past a certain level of success without Spice, and later Quartz, that can only be generated in Oriental lands. Although populations generate taxable income, it is difficult to generate enough gold to make meaningful capital investments without extensive trading. This is simplified by an automatic trading process that allows an island to make resources available to visiting merchant ships.\n\nAs players progress through the game, they gain access to naval vessels and troops which allow them to invade and ultimately to defeat other players. ''Anno 1404'' features an updated interface, bigger islands and worlds to explore, a [[Sandbox game#Sandbox mode|sandbox mode]] and other features new to the Anno series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein|first=Maarten|title=GC 2008: ANNO Goes Back In Time, ''ANNO 1404'' Announced|publisher=[[Shacknews]]|date=2008-08-20|accessdate=2008-08-21|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54275| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820225928/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54275| archivedate= 20 August 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n=== New features ===\nAnno 1404 has several new features that distinguish it from its three predecessors: ''[[Anno 1503]]'', ''[[Anno 1602]]'', and ''[[Anno 1701]]''. These features include:\n\n==== Occident and Orient ====\nAs was the case in ''[[Anno 1701]]'', the game world is divided into two culturally distinct zones. In Anno 1404, these zones are inspired by, though not intended to be historically accurate to, northwestern Renaissance Europe and the medieval Near East, referred to as the Occident and the Orient respectively. One of the major differences between previous entries in the series and Anno 1404 is that players are required to build both occidental and oriental settlements simultaneously in order for the inhabitants of their settlements and available buildings to advance. Despite the addition of player-managed oriental settlements, the Occident remains the primary focus of the game. The Orient acts more of a trading partner in order for Occidental people to advance in class. In order for this to occur, Oriental goods such as [[spice]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and [[quartz]] must be produced and shipped from Oriental colonies.\n\n==== Housing levels ====\nThere are a total of six levels of housing including both occidental and oriental settlements (one more than the levels included in [[Anno 1701]]). The four occidental levels are [[peasants]], [[citizens]], [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]s and [[noblemen]]. The two oriental levels are [[nomads]] and envoys. In the Occident, the player starts by building peasant housing, and in the orient, the players start by building nomad housing, both of which advance when conditions are met. These conditions include the acquisition of goods as mentioned above, as well as the construction of specific buildings, such as a debtors' prison, bath house or a cathedral.\n\n==== Civilization class ratios ====\nIn ''[[Anno 1701]]'', every residential structure could be advanced to the uppermost class, so a city could be entirely made up of Aristocrats by the end of a game. In Anno 1404, a number of peasants are required to support a moderate amount of citizens who in turn support a number patricians and noblemen. There are several other factors that can impact the ratio of lower class to upper class, however.  For instance, the number of envoys settled in the player's oriental settlements will satisfy a sum of the peasants and citizens required to support patricians and noblemen in occidental settlements.\n\n==== New goods ====\nSince the game takes place in the year 1404, the range of goods available is significantly different from the goods available in the previous games, which took place later in history (although goods like [[fish]] and [[beer]] were retained from the previous installments). Some of the new goods include [[spices]], [[bread]], [[meat]], [[candlesticks]], leather jerkins, and [[brocade]] robes for the Occident and [[date (fruit)|date]]s, [[milk]], [[carpets]], [[pearl]] [[necklaces]], and [[marzipan]] for the Orient.\n\n==== Quests ====\nAlthough quests are not new to Anno 1404, both it and its expansion, 'Anno 1404: Venice,' feature far more quests than previous games in the series. Quests are given at different intervals to the player by neutral powers, mentors like Northburgh and Al Zahir, and from various people living in the player's settlements. Computer opponents, if they become allies through diplomacy, will also offer quests to the player. Quests offer rewards such as honour points, ships, gold, goods or upgrades for settlements or ships (such as items to boost goods production in a settlement or increase the firepower of a ship). There are several quest types, including fetch quests, reverse fetch quests, sinking enemy ships, or finding specific individuals in a settlement (a mini game similar to [[Where's Waldo]]). Some of these quests can be quite complicated, with multiple smaller quests in the chain. The 'Anno 1404: Venice' expansion adds 300 new quests and two new types of quests: trading race and ship boarding.\n\n=== Achievements ===\n''Anno 1404'' and its add-on Venice add the possibility of rewarding achievements to the player. Those achievements can be seen as 'milestones' and vary from quite easy to extremely hard, since a lot of them are 'hidden'. The achievements are divided in 5 categories: diplomacy, setup, economic, military and general. Quite a few of the achievements are interlinked, being part of another 'bigger' achievement. In the base game there were 206 achievements to be had, the Venice expansion added another 110 of them, totalling 316.\nHowever, as of patch 2.1/1.3 not all achievements are reachable, as syntax errors in the games' xml files are still present. Trying to correct these game files will result in the achievement not being awarded as the game recognises this as modification. This has been addressed by an unofficial user-made patch, about which see below.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Anno1404 screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|''Anno 1404'' partly takes place in the [[Orient]].]]\n\nThe campaign begins when the player is sent to administer a [[fief]] granted to him by the Emperor, in the [[Western world|Occident]]. The Emperor is unwell and Lord Richard Northburgh, cousin and treasurer of the Emperor, is building a magnificent [[Cathedral]] to pray for the Emperor's health. Meanwhile, Cardinal Lucius is making preparations for a [[Crusade]] against the [[Saracen]]s of the [[Orient]], aided by Guy Forcas.\n\nIn the first few chapters of the campaign, the player learns the basics of game-play and the economy by assisting Northburgh and Forcas with supply and construction tasks, as well as meeting some of the other main characters.\n\nAs the [[Crusades|Crusader]] ships leave the harbor, Northburgh begins to uncover clues to a mysterious plot. He and the player travel to the [[Orient]] and befriend the [[Grand Vizier]] of the Sultan, Al Zahir, who helps the player to defeat a band of [[Barbary corsairs|Corsairs]] and break up a child trafficking scheme. The plot thickens as further clues reveal that a main character is implicated in a sinister conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor himself. Because he comes too close to the truth, Lord Northburgh is captured and the player is tasked with unraveling the mystery.\n\nOver the next several chapters, the player must win over new allies, convince the leaders of the Crusade that they are being manipulated under false pretenses, and survive dire circumstances in order to defeat the villains and restore the Emperor to his rightful place.\n\nThe campaign is divided into eight chapters and each chapter can be played on 3 different difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. Apart from the story elements, the campaign serves as a tutorial to prepare the player for the more rigorous scenarios and continuous game modes.\n\nAll of the main characters encountered in the campaign are also encountered in the scenarios mode and can be selected as computer opponents in continuous games, although the actions of the characters during the campaign are unrelated to their actions in these modes apart from having similar personalities. Lord Northburgh and Al Zahir act as mentors and trade partners in the other modes, much like they do in the campaign.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Digital rights management ===\nThe game has a rigorous [[digital rights management]] (DRM) system based on [[Tag\u00e8s]]. It forces users to activate their game online once by submitting an activation code after each installation on a different computer or a significant hardware change. The activation can be performed on any PC with an Internet connection. It can only be activated three times by default and unlike many other DRM systems, it does not support revocation of already used licenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesprotection.com/activation.htm#revoke |title=Activation |publisher=Tagesprotection.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref> Further licenses can be requested free of charge by contacting Ubisoft.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ubisoft |url=http://anno.uk.ubi.com/pc/faq-tages.php |title=The Official ANNO 1404 Copy Protection FAQs &#124; ANNO Portal &#124; Ubisoft |publisher=Anno.uk.ubi.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>\n\nThe copy protection has been completely removed with patch v1.1 for the DVD version.

On November 25, 2010, a third patch was released to address (among other things) a serious save game bug, patching the base game to version 1.3 and the 'Venice' expansion to version 2.1. The 'Gold' version of the game that includes both the original game and the 'Venice' expansion was also patched in November 2010 to version 3.1, which combines all the changes of the version 1.3 patch of the base game, and version 2.1 of 'Venice'.\n\nUbisoft never released North American patches for the final version 1.3 patch for the base game and the version 2.1 patch for ''Dawn of Discovery: Venice''. However, the North American game can be manually patched to version 1.3 and version 2.1 by simply downloading the already unpacked European patch files.<ref>{{cite web|title=PATCH DoD 1.3 and Venice 2.1 File Download|publisher=Steam User Forums|author=Brumbek|date=2011-10-13|accessdate=2011-10-21|url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2115188}}</ref>\n\nAn [[unofficial patch|unofficial user-made patch]] (version 1.10 as of February 2013) was made available in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=[PATCH] Anno 1404/DoD: Venice Unofficial Patch!|publisher=Steam User Forums |author=Brumbek |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2013-04-22|url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2271596}}</ref> The patch addresses issues with broken quests, fixes spelling and grammar errors, adds proper English localizations, adds English translations for over 1,000 quests which only had description text in the German version, and fixes countless other issues. The patch is created in such a way that the game will not detect modding and therefore fully allow unlocking achievements. The patch can be installed and uninstalled at will since it does not affect saved games.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 82/100<ref name=\"metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery |title=Dawn of Discovery for PC Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>\n| GRadar = favorable<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/dawn-of-discovery-review/</ref>\n| EuroG = 8/10<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/anno-1404-review | last=Pearson | first=Dan | date=2009-06-07 | publisher=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate=2018-12-10 | title=Anno 1404}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.5/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dawn-of-discovery-review/1900-6213429/|title=Dawn of Discovery Review for PC |publisher=GameSpot |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8.2/10<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|author=Josh Clark |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/100/1004049p1.html |title=Dawn of Discovery Review |publisher=IGN |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Anno 1404'' received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregator [[Metacritic]].<ref  name=\"metacritic\" />\n\n[[IGN]] gave the game an 8.2, saying it was \"a worthy successor to the Anno franchise.\" <ref name=\"IGN\"/> D Critic praised the game, saying that \"with up-to-date graphics, a great soundtrack, and great gameplay, there\u2019s a lot to love about this game.\" <ref>[http://www.dcritic.com/games/dawn-of-discovery/ D Critic.

The Venice expansion also allows the player to play the original 6 scenarios of the base game but with all the added features and improvements of the Venice addon.\n\nMany new buildings were added:\n* A multi-part personal mansion\n* New ornamental buildings such as Saint Mark's pillar\n\nTwo new quest type were added: ship race and privateering.\n\nFurthermore, the player now has the option of requesting a quest in order to gain more honour points and/or gold coins/goods.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dawnofdiscoverygame.us.ubi.com/pc Official US site]\n*[http://anno.uk.ubi.com/pc Official UK site]\n\n{{Anno series}}\n\n[[Category:Fiction set in the 1400s]]\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Age of Discovery video games]]\n[[Category:Anno (series)]]\n[[Category:City-building games]]\n[[Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Real-time strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Germany]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 15th century]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the Middle Ages]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n[[Category:Blue Byte games]]\n", "name_user": "177.155.123.82", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReception)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_1404"}
{"title_page": "Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937\u201345)", "text_new": "[[Image:Soviet volunteer.jpg|thumb|A Soviet-made [[Polikarpov I-16]] with Chinese insignia. The I-16 was the main fighter plane used by the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] and Soviet volunteers]]\n\nThe [[Republic of China Air Force]] (ROCAF) was formed by the [[Kuomintang]] after the establishment of the Aviation Ministry in 1920. As tensions mounted between [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]] and [[Imperial Japan]] in the 1930s, a number of smaller Chinese warlord airforce men (including  Guangdong Provincial Air Force) and equipment became integrated into the ROCAF in a centralized effort to counter Imperial Japanese military ambitions.\n\n==Operations==\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the [[Yangtze river]] and interdiction and close-air support during the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937. The initially Chinese frontline fighter aircraft were mainly [[Curtiss BFC Goshawk|Curtiss Hawk IIs]], [[Curtiss BF2C Goshawk|Hawk IIIs]] and [[Boeing P-26|Boeing P-26Cs]]. These engaged Japanese fighters in many major air battles beginning on 14 August 1937, when [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] warplanes raided Chienchiao airbase; \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighters in the world's first dogfight between all-metal [[monoplane]] fighters. A unique mission in April 1938 saw two Chinese [[Martin B-10]] bombers fly a mission over [[Japan]], dropping only anti-war leaflets over the Japanese cities of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Saga]]. It was a [[war of attrition]] for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant [[Liu Tsui-Kang]] and Colonel [[Kao Chih-Hang]], were lost. Six months into the war, which is considered the beginning of [[World War II]] in [[Asia]], the Chinese Air Force inventory of frontline American Hawk IIs and IIIss and P-26Cs were superseded by faster and better armed [[Polikarpov I-15]]s and [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]]s as support from the [[Soviet Union]] grew and American support faded.\n\n[[File:Curtiss P-40E Warhawk 2 USAF.jpg|thumb|American [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40E Warhawk]] decorated with the famous sharkmouth nose art that had identified the AVG]]\n\nThrough attrition and loss of their most experienced fighter pilots in the first half of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Republic of China Air Force ultimately suffered irreversible losses in combat against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], and by the beginning of 1942 the ROCAF was practically annihilated by Japanese aircraft, particularly with the introduction of the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]. The ROCAF was eventually supplemented with the establishment of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (known as the \"Flying Tigers\") with heavily armed and armored [[Curtiss P-40]] Warhawks, and subsequently rebuilt each year following Imperial Japan's attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] with new aid and vigor from the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War started on 7 July 1937. At that time, Chinese sources estimated the Japanese could field approximately 600 aircraft (from a total of 1,530) against China's 230 combat aircraft. During the first phase up to 1939, aerial bombing of enemy bomber formations was tried with indifferent results, and leaflet-dropping raids carried out over Japanese cities.\n \nThe Japanese bombing raids were also fiercely contested, sometimes with significant Japanese losses. After suffering heavy losses in the [[Battle of Wuhan]] in October 1938, most air force units were withdrawn for reorganisation and training.\n\nThe ROC Air Force was reconstituted into seven Groups, one separate Squadron and four [[Volunteer Groups]]. In 1939, after the USSR concluded a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Germany, the [[Soviet Volunteer Group]] was withdrawn. By the end of 1941, the air force had 364 operational aircraft. Up to 100 of these were [[P-40 Warhawk|P-40B]]s operated by the [[American Volunteer Group]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rossi |first=J.R. |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger1.htm |title= History: The Flying Tigers - American Volunteer Group - Chinese Air Force |year=1998 |work=AVG}}</ref> U.S. replacement aircraft began to arrive in March 1942.

In addition, there were 37 aircraft transferred to Chinese when Soviet force withdrew from China after the signing of [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact|Soviet\u2013German Non-Aggression Pact]].  These aircraft included 563 fighters, including 252 [[Polikarpov I-15#Variants|I-152]], 75 [[Polikarpov I-153|I-153]], 132 [[Polikarpov I-16#Variants|I-16 Type 10]], 75 [[Polikarpov I-16#Variants|I-16 Type 17]] and rest being [[Polikarpov I-15#Variants|I-15 bis]], which was not part of the purchase in the 13 batches. Also included were 322 bombers, including 179 [[Tupolev SB#Variants|SB-2M-100A]], 100 [[Tupolev SB#Variants|SB-2M-103]] 24 [[DB-3]], 6 [[TB-3]] and 13 [[Tupolev SB|SB]] that were not part of the purchase in the 13 batches). Also included in the 13-batch purchase were 5 [[Yakovlev UT-1|UT-1]] trainers.  However, of the 250\u2013300 combat aircraft supplied annually, only a few dozen would survive through the end of the year.\n\n===United States===\nWhile the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] provided most of the military aircraft to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the late 1930s, many early Chinese aircraft were supplied by the American [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]]. In 1937 the [[Hawk II]] and [[Hawk III]] biplanes comprised the backbone of Chinese fighter aviation. These were soon followed by the [[Hawk 75]] monoplane. The demonstration model [[Hawk 75N]], with non-retractable landing gear was purchased in 1938 and became the personal aircraft of the American advisor to the Aviation Committee, [[Claire Chennault]] who oversaw training and lobbied for the procurement of American aircraft.\n\nThe entry of the USA into the war with Japan at the end of 1941 led to the receipt of Lend-Lease equipment from the United States, including aircraft. American Lend-Lease aviation equipment had already begun to arrive in China as early as the middle of 1941, though that includes the first shipments before January 1942 which arrived under the guise of purchases.  Including previously purchased American aircraft, US soon replaced USSR as the largest supplier for the Chinese Nationalist air force during the war (Including the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] that actually broke out in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria).\n\nRetraining on American aircraft occurred for the most part in India. (Karachi and other cities), where Chinese pilots were sent both as groups and as entire units.  As early as the end of 1941 Chinese pilots, mainly recently graduated from flight schools, began to be sent to the US for longer training and mastery of American aircraft.\n\nThe first American P-43A fighters were received by the 4th Air Group (21st \u2013 24th Squadrons) in March 1942.  They retrained in Kunming, but for the new aircraft the pilots sequentially flew in small groups to India.  On 24 April the deputy commander of the 24th Squadron, Wu Zhenhua, crashed on the flight to [[Kunming]].  On 12 May, [[Chen Lokun]], the flight commander of the 24th Squadron was killed during a training flight, crashing into a tree during landing.  In July for unclear reasons the P-43 of the 4th Air Group commander, [[Zheng Shaoyu]], caught fire in the air and the pilot was killed.  On 3 August 1942 during a training flight the deputy group commander [[Chen Sheng (aviator)|Chen Sheng]] crashed.  A similar series of crashes accompanied the mastery by the Chinese of almost every new machine.  (It is notable that in Chinese sources the family names are given only of the perished commanders of various ranks, while the losses amongst the line pilots are hardly even noted.) Concluding their conversion to the [[P-43]]A in early August 1942, the group returned to Chengdu.\n\nIn February 1943, preparing for transition to the new American air equipment, the Chinese transferred to India the primary training groups from their flight schools.  Only training for reconnaissance and photography continued to be carried out in China. In March 1945 the cadets completing primary training in India were sent to America to train further.  By that time the number of cadets dispatched had reached 1224, of whom 384 managed to return to China and participate in combat.  In all, from 1942 to 1945 420 training aircraft were sent from the US to China through India, including 20 [[T-6 Texan|AT-6]], 8 [[Beechcraft Model 18|AT-7]], 15 [[Cessna AT-17|AT-17]], 150 [[PT-17]], 127 [[PT-19]], 70 [[PT-22]], and 30 [[BT-13]], and also 10 [[Beechcraft Staggerwing|Beechcraft D-17]] medical aircraft.\n\n==Domestic assembly==\nWhile the modified Hawk 75M with retractable landing gear was created specially for China, it was not widely used in the war against the Japanese, in spite of the fact that 30 aircraft, and 82 kits for assembly were delivered in the summer and autumn of 1938. It was planned to assemble the Hawk in a factory operated by the [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]], which had been evacuated from [[Hankou]] to [[Loiwing]]. The latter location, not far from the Burmese border on the eastern bank of the [[Ruiluqiang]] River in [[Yunnan]] Province, at that time seemed protected from Japanese attacks, but technical difficulties plagued the actual assembly of the Hawk 75 in that location. Although the Japanese had not bombed the factory, only eight machines were assembled by October 1940. The fate of the remaining kits is unknown.\n\nFollowing the failure of Hawk 75 production, the CAMCO factory planned to organize assembly of the export version of the [[Curtiss-Wright CW-21]] Demon, light fighter. Three aircraft and 32 sets of components were ordered from the USA. The factory at Loiwing worked until April 1942, when on account of Japanese attacks it had to be evacuated to [[Kunming]], while its American personnel set up shop in India.  From 1943 to 1946 the aircraft factory, which was dispersed in the ravines neighboring Kunming, assembled an experimental series of nine fighter monoplanes, probably from components of the [[Hawk 75M]] and [[75A-5]], and [[CW-21]].  To a degree they were similar to the American prototypes and their further fate is unknown. In western sources the first example figures under the designation [[Chu X-PO]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aerial engagements of the Second Sino-Japanese War]]\n*[[Soong Mei-ling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2011}}\n*{{cite web|last=Rossi |first=J.R. |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/ |title=AVG American Volunteer Group - Flying Tigers }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Byrd, Martha: ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'', University of Alabama Press, 1987.\n* Ford, Daniel: ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and the American Volunteer Group'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1991.  \n* Gordon, David M.: \"The China-Japan War, 1931\u20131945\", ''Journal of Military History'', Vol. 70 (2006), No. 1, pp.&nbsp;137\u2013182.\n* Liu, F.

The I-16 was the main fighter plane used by the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] and Soviet volunteers]]\n\nThe [[Republic of China Air Force]] (ROCAF) was formed by the [[Kuomintang]] after the establishment of the Aviation Ministry in 1920. As tensions mounted between [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|China]] and [[Imperial Japan]] in the 1930s, a number of smaller Chinese warlord airforce men (including  Guangdong Provincial Air Force) and equipment became integrated into the ROCAF in a centralized effort to counter Imperial Japanese military ambitions.\n\n==Operations==\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the [[Yangtze river]] and interdiction and close-air support during the [[Battle of Shanghai]] in 1937. The initially Chinese frontline fighter aircraft were mainly [[Curtiss BFC Goshawk|Curtiss Hawk IIs]], [[Curtiss BF2C Goshawk|Hawk IIIs]] and [[Boeing P-26|Boeing P-26Cs]]. These engaged Japanese fighters in many major air battles beginning on 14 August 1937, when [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] warplanes raided Chienchiao airbase; \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighters in the world's first dogfight between all-metal [[monoplane]] fighters. A unique mission in April 1938 saw two Chinese [[Martin B-10]] bombers fly a mission over [[Japan]], dropping only anti-war leaflets over the Japanese cities of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and [[Saga]]. It was a [[war of attrition]] for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant [[Liu Tsui-Kang]] and Colonel [[Kao Chih-Hang]], were lost. Six months into the war, which is considered the beginning of [[World War II]] in [[Asia]], the Chinese Air Force inventory of frontline American Hawk IIs and IIIss and P-26Cs were superseded by faster and better armed [[Polikarpov I-15]]s and [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]]s as support from the [[Soviet Union]] grew and American support faded.\n\n[[File:Curtiss P-40E Warhawk 2 USAF.jpg|thumb|American [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40E Warhawk]] decorated with the famous sharkmouth nose art that had identified the AVG]]\n\nThrough attrition and loss of their most experienced fighter pilots in the first half of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Republic of China Air Force ultimately suffered irreversible losses in combat against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], and by the beginning of 1942 the ROCAF was practically annihilated by Japanese aircraft, particularly with the introduction of the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]. The ROCAF was eventually supplemented with the establishment of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (known as the \"Flying Tigers\") with heavily armed and armored [[Curtiss P-40]] Warhawks, and subsequently rebuilt each year following Imperial Japan's attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] with new aid and vigor from the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\nThe Sino-Japanese War started on 7 July 1937. At that time, Chinese sources estimated the Japanese could field approximately 600 aircraft (from a total of 1,530) against China's 230 combat aircraft. During the first phase up to 1939, aerial bombing of enemy bomber formations was tried with indifferent results, and leaflet-dropping raids carried out over Japanese cities.\n \nThe Japanese bombing raids were also fiercely contested, sometimes with significant Japanese losses. After suffering heavy losses in the [[Battle of Wuhan]] in October 1938, most air force units were withdrawn for reorganisation and training.\n\nThe ROC Air Force was reconstituted into seven Groups, one separate Squadron and four [[Volunteer Groups]]. In 1939, after the USSR concluded a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Germany, the [[Soviet Volunteer Group]] was withdrawn. By the end of 1941, the air force had 364 operational aircraft. Up to 100 of these were [[P-40 Warhawk|P-40B]]s operated by the [[American Volunteer Group]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rossi |first=J.R. |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger1.htm |title= History: The Flying Tigers - American Volunteer Group - Chinese Air Force |year=1998 |work=AVG}}</ref> U.S. replacement aircraft began to arrive in March 1942.

Also included were 322 bombers, including 179 [[Tupolev SB#Variants|SB-2M-100A]], 100 [[Tupolev SB#Variants|SB-2M-103]] 24 [[DB-3]], 6 [[TB-3]] and 13 [[Tupolev SB|SB]] that were not part of the purchase in the 13 batches). Also included in the 13-batch purchase were 5 [[Yakovlev UT-1|UT-1]] trainers.  However, of the 250\u2013300 combat aircraft supplied annually, only a few dozen would survive through the end of the year.\n\n===United States===\nWhile the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] provided most of the military aircraft to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the late 1930s, many early Chinese aircraft were supplied by the American [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company]]. In 1937 the [[Hawk II]] and [[Hawk III]] biplanes comprised the backbone of Chinese fighter aviation. These were soon followed by the [[Hawk 75]] monoplane. The demonstration model [[Hawk 75N]], with non-retractable landing gear was purchased in 1938 and became the personal aircraft of the American advisor to the Aviation Committee, [[Claire Chennault]] who oversaw training and lobbied for the procurement of American aircraft.\n\nThe entry of the USA into the war with Japan at the end of 1941 led to the receipt of Lend-Lease equipment from the United States, including aircraft. American Lend-Lease aviation equipment had already begun to arrive in China as early as the middle of 1941, though that includes the first shipments before January 1942 which arrived under the guise of purchases.  Including previously purchased American aircraft, US soon replaced USSR as the largest supplier for the Chinese Nationalist air force during the war (Including the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] that actually broke out in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria).\n\nRetraining on American aircraft occurred for the most part in India. (Karachi and other cities), where Chinese pilots were sent both as groups and as entire units.  As early as the end of 1941 Chinese pilots, mainly recently graduated from flight schools, began to be sent to the US for longer training and mastery of American aircraft.\n\nThe first American P-43A fighters were received by the 4th Air Group (21st \u2013 24th Squadrons) in March 1942.  They retrained in Kunming, but for the new aircraft the pilots sequentially flew in small groups to India.  On 24 April the deputy commander of the 24th Squadron, Wu Zhenhua, crashed on the flight to [[Kunming]].  On 12 May, [[Chen Lokun]], the flight commander of the 24th Squadron was killed during a training flight, crashing into a tree during landing.  In July for unclear reasons the P-43 of the 4th Air Group commander, [[Zheng Shaoyu]], caught fire in the air and the pilot was killed.  On 3 August 1942 during a training flight the deputy group commander [[Chen Sheng (aviator)|Chen Sheng]] crashed.  A similar series of crashes accompanied the mastery by the Chinese of almost every new machine.  (It is notable that in Chinese sources the family names are given only of the perished commanders of various ranks, while the losses amongst the line pilots are hardly even noted.) Concluding their conversion to the [[P-43]]A in early August 1942, the group returned to Chengdu.\n\nIn February 1943, preparing for transition to the new American air equipment, the Chinese transferred to India the primary training groups from their flight schools.  Only training for reconnaissance and photography continued to be carried out in China. In March 1945 the cadets completing primary training in India were sent to America to train further.  By that time the number of cadets dispatched had reached 1224, of whom 384 managed to return to China and participate in combat.  In all, from 1942 to 1945 420 training aircraft were sent from the US to China through India, including 20 [[T-6 Texan|AT-6]], 8 [[Beechcraft Model 18|AT-7]], 15 [[Cessna AT-17|AT-17]], 150 [[PT-17]], 127 [[PT-19]], 70 [[PT-22]], and 30 [[BT-13]], and also 10 [[Beechcraft Staggerwing|Beechcraft D-17]] medical aircraft.\n\n==Domestic assembly==\nWhile the modified Hawk 75M with retractable landing gear was created specially for China, it was not widely used in the war against the Japanese, in spite of the fact that 30 aircraft, and 82 kits for assembly were delivered in the summer and autumn of 1938. It was planned to assemble the Hawk in a factory operated by the [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]], which had been evacuated from [[Hankou]] to [[Loiwing]]. The latter location, not far from the Burmese border on the eastern bank of the [[Ruiluqiang]] River in [[Yunnan]] Province, at that time seemed protected from Japanese attacks, but technical difficulties plagued the actual assembly of the Hawk 75 in that location. Although the Japanese had not bombed the factory, only eight machines were assembled by October 1940. The fate of the remaining kits is unknown.\n\nFollowing the failure of Hawk 75 production, the CAMCO factory planned to organize assembly of the export version of the [[Curtiss-Wright CW-21]] Demon, light fighter. Three aircraft and 32 sets of components were ordered from the USA. The factory at Loiwing worked until April 1942, when on account of Japanese attacks it had to be evacuated to [[Kunming]], while its American personnel set up shop in India.  From 1943 to 1946 the aircraft factory, which was dispersed in the ravines neighboring Kunming, assembled an experimental series of nine fighter monoplanes, probably from components of the [[Hawk 75M]] and [[75A-5]], and [[CW-21]].  To a degree they were similar to the American prototypes and their further fate is unknown. In western sources the first example figures under the designation [[Chu X-PO]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aerial engagements of the Second Sino-Japanese War]]\n*[[Soong Mei-ling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2011}}\n*{{cite web|last=Rossi |first=J.R. |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/ |title=AVG American Volunteer Group - Flying Tigers }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Byrd, Martha: ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'', University of Alabama Press, 1987.\n* Ford, Daniel: ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and the American Volunteer Group'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1991.  \n* Gordon, David M.: \"The China-Japan War, 1931\u20131945\", ''Journal of Military History'', Vol. 70 (2006), No. 1, pp. 137\u2013182.\n* Liu, F.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state).

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Weicker Jr.]], an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%.

However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.\n\nConnecticut levies a 6.35% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.<ref name=\"2011Sect6Summary\">{{cite web |title=Summary of Tax Provisions Contained in 2011 Conn.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns. In 1911, Connecticut's oyster production reached its peak at nearly 25 million pounds of oyster meats. This was, at the time, higher than production in New York, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/oystering-in-connecticut-from-colonial-times-to-today/ |website=Connecticut History |title=Oystering in Connecticut, from Colonial Times to the 21st century |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref> During this time, the Connecticut coast was known in the shellfishing industry as the oyster capital of the world.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.

The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months.

On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut.

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house.

There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.

The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]], the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired [[nomenklatura]] system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include [[He Guoqiang]], [[Wang Yang (politician)|Wang Yang]], [[Bo Xilai]], [[Zhang Dejiang]], and [[Sun Zhengcai]], the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal [[party standing committee]], the ''de facto'' top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\n\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |title=Chongqing Party Chief Position |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124203540/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |archive-date=24 November 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (''zhengxie'') meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The ''zhengxie'' is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n===Military===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946,<ref name=\"Chongqing: The modern period\">{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing/Administration-and-society#toc10770 | title=Chongqing History: The Modern Period | publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | accessdate=2016-07-31 | author=Kuo, Ping-chia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622174649/http://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing/Administration-and-society#toc10770 | archive-date=22 June 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to [[Nanjing]] and then [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |title=Chongqing, once a wartime capitol |publisher=En.cq.gov.cn |date=14 March 1997 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630171340/http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese [[Korean War]] hero [[Qiu Shaoyun]].<ref name=\"sxrtvu\">{{cite web|url=http://vod.sxrtvu.edu:8081/englishonline/culture/chinaculture/chinaculture/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_30254.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010137/http://vod.sxrtvu.edu:8081/englishonline/culture/chinaculture/chinaculture/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_30254.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-12-03|title=Qiu Shaoyun Memorial Hall |accessdate=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nChongqing used to be the headquarters of the [[13th Group Army]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]], one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the [[Chengdu Military Region]], which in 2016 was re-organized into the [[Western Theater Command]].<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/13ga.htm |title=A history of the 13th Army Group |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=21 November 2003 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313004857/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/13ga.htm |archive-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main list|List of administrative divisions of Chongqing}}\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China.

However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |title=Chongqing Ports Details |publisher=Service-industries-research.hktdc.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061157/http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:ChongqingFunicular2.jpg|thumb|left|Chongqing [[funicular railway]]]]\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\n*[[Chongqing railway station]] in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 ([[Lianglukou station|Lianglukou Metro station]]), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre.

This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces.

The municipality's top leader is the secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (\"party chief\"), which, since 2007, has also held a seat on the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China]], the country's second highest governing council. Under the Soviet-inspired [[nomenklatura]] system of appointments, individuals are appointed to the position by the central leadership of the Communist Party, and bestowed to an official based on seniority and adherence to party orthodoxy, usually given to an individual with prior regional experience elsewhere in China and nearly never a native of Chongqing. Notable individuals who have held the municipal Party Secretary position include [[He Guoqiang]], [[Wang Yang (politician)|Wang Yang]], [[Bo Xilai]], [[Zhang Dejiang]], and [[Sun Zhengcai]], the latter three were Politburo members during their term as party chief. The party chief heads the municipal [[party standing committee]], the ''de facto'' top governing council of the municipality. The standing committee is typically composed of 13 individuals which includes the party chiefs of important subdivisions and other leading figures in the local party and government organization, as well as one military representative.\n\nThe municipal People's Government serves as the day-to-day administrative authority, and is headed by the mayor, who is assisted by numerous vice mayors and mayoral assistants. Each vice mayor is given jurisdiction over specific municipal departments. The mayor is the second-highest-ranking official in the municipality. The mayor usually represents the city when foreign guests visit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Page |first=Jeremy |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |title=Chongqing Party Chief Position |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124203540/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577282280904864936 |archive-date=24 November 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe municipality also has a People's Congress, theoretically elected by lower level People's Congresses. The People's Congress nominally appoints the mayor and approves the nominations of other government officials. The People's Congress, like those of other provincial jurisdictions, is generally seen as a symbolic body. It convenes in full once a year to approve party-sponsored resolutions and local regulations and duly confirm party-approved appointments. On occasion the People's Congress can be venues of discussion on municipal issues, although this is dependent on the actions of individual delegates. The municipal People's Congress is headed by a former municipal official, usually in their late fifties or sixties, with a lengthy prior political career in Chongqing. The municipal Political Consultative Conference (''zhengxie'') meets at around the same time as the People's Congress. Its role is to advise on political issues. The ''zhengxie'' is headed by a leader who is typically a former municipal or regional official with a lengthy career in the party and government bureaucracy.\n\n===Military===\nChongqing was the wartime capital of China during the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] (i.e., World War II), and from 1938 to 1946,<ref name=\"Chongqing: The modern period\">{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing/Administration-and-society#toc10770 | title=Chongqing History: The Modern Period | publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | accessdate=2016-07-31 | author=Kuo, Ping-chia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622174649/http://www.britannica.com/place/Chongqing/Administration-and-society#toc10770 | archive-date=22 June 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> the seat of administration for the Republic of China's government before its departure to [[Nanjing]] and then [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |title=Chongqing, once a wartime capitol |publisher=En.cq.gov.cn |date=14 March 1997 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630171340/http://en.cq.gov.cn/AboutChongqing/1920.htm |archive-date=30 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It also contains a military museum named after the Chinese [[Korean War]] hero [[Qiu Shaoyun]].<ref name=\"sxrtvu\">{{cite web|url=http://vod.sxrtvu.edu:8081/englishonline/culture/chinaculture/chinaculture/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_30254.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010137/http://vod.sxrtvu.edu:8081/englishonline/culture/chinaculture/chinaculture/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_30254.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-12-03|title=Qiu Shaoyun Memorial Hall |accessdate=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nChongqing used to be the headquarters of the [[13th Group Army]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]], one of the two group armies that formerly comprised the [[Chengdu Military Region]], which in 2016 was re-organized into the [[Western Theater Command]].<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/13ga.htm |title=A history of the 13th Army Group |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=21 November 2003 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313004857/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/13ga.htm |archive-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main list|List of administrative divisions of Chongqing}}\n\nChongqing is the largest of the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China.

However, improved rail, expressways and air travel have seen this ferry traffic reduced or cancelled altogether. Most of the river ferry traffic consists of leisure cruises for tourists rather than local needs. Improved access by larger cargo vessels has been made due to the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. This allows bulk transport of goods along the Yangtze River. Coal, raw minerals and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this section of the river. Several port handling facilities exist throughout the city, including many impromptu river bank sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |title=Chongqing Ports Details |publisher=Service-industries-research.hktdc.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061157/http://service-industries-research.hktdc.com/business-news/article/Transport-Logistics/Chongqing-River-Port-S-Container-Volume-Increases-16-9pc-In-May/spgz/en/1/1X000000/1X07JEN7.htm |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:ChongqingFunicular2.jpg|thumb|left|Chongqing [[funicular railway]]]]\nMajor train stations in Chongqing:\n\n*[[Chongqing railway station]] in Yuzhong, accessible via Metro Lines 1 & 3 ([[Lianglukou station|Lianglukou Metro station]]), is the city's oldest railway station and located near the city centre.

This has seen many tunnels and large bridges needing to be built across the city. Construction of many expressways have connected Chongqing to neighbouring provinces. Several ring roads have also been constructed.

Options for sound optimizations exist, as well as ways to wirelessly share the iTunes library.\n\nOriginally announced by then-CEO [[Steve Jobs]] on January 9, 2001, iTunes' original and main focus was music, with a library offering organization, collection, and storage of users' music collections. In 2005, however, Apple expanded on the core features with support for digital video, [[podcasts]], [[e-books]], and [[mobile apps]] purchased from [[App Store (iOS)|the iOS App Store]] (the last of which it discontinued in 2017). Further, with the release of the [[iPhone]] in 2007, additional functionality was added to iTunes to enable syncing of the device to a computer and to initiate software updates. Since the release of [[iOS 5]] in 2011, iOS devices have had less reliance on iTunes in order to function, though it can still be used to back up the contents of mobile devices, as well as to share files with personal computers. iTunes was also essential in the functioning of [[Apple TV]] in its early years, to stream content from PCs and Macs with the software.\n\nThough well-received in its early years, iTunes soon received increasingly significant criticism for a [[software bloat|bloated]] user experience, with Apple adopting an all-encompassing feature-set in iTunes rather than sticking to its original music-based purpose. On June 3, 2019, Apple announced that iTunes in [[macOS Catalina]] would be replaced by separate apps, namely [[Apple Music (software)|Music]], [[Podcasts (software)|Podcasts]], and [[Apple TV (software)|TV]]. [[Finder (software)|Finder]] would take over the device management capabilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647182/apple-itunes-podcasts-music-tv-mac-os-wwdc-2019|title=Apple breaks up iTunes, creates separate Podcasts, TV, and Music apps for macOS|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=2019-06-03|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/itunes-shutting-down-1203231598/|title=Apple Is Officially Killing iTunes, Replacing It With Three Dedicated Media Apps|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=2019-06-03|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> This change would not affect Windows or older macOS versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-itunes-store-ios-windows-not-going-away-1203231814/|title=Apple\u2019s iTunes Store, iTunes App for Windows Aren\u2019t Going Away|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2019-06-03|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of iTunes}}\n[[SoundJam MP]], released by [[Casady & Greene]] in 1998, was renamed \"iTunes\" when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] purchased it in 2000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/01/01/08/apple_acquires_soundjam_programmer_for_imusic|title=Apple Acquires SoundJam, Programmer for iMusic|last=|first=|date=|work=Apple Insider|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>.

Options for sound optimizations exist, as well as ways to wirelessly share the iTunes library.\n\nOriginally announced by then-CEO [[Steve Jobs]] on January 9, 2001, iTunes' original and main focus was music, with a library offering organization, collection, and storage of users' music collections. In 2005, however, Apple expanded on the core features with support for digital video, [[podcasts]], [[e-books]], and [[mobile apps]] purchased from [[App Store (iOS)|the iOS App Store]] (the last of which it discontinued in 2017). The [[iPhone (1st generation)|original]] [[iPhone]] required iTunes for activation. Until the release of [[iOS 5]] in 2011, iTunes was required for updating mobile apps. Newer iOS devices have less reliance on iTunes in order to function, though it can still be used to back up the contents of mobile devices, as well as to share files with personal computers.\n\nThough well-received in its early years, iTunes soon received increasingly significant criticism for a [[software bloat|bloated]] user experience, with Apple adopting an all-encompassing feature-set in iTunes rather than sticking to its original music-based purpose. On June 3, 2019, Apple announced that iTunes in [[macOS Catalina]] would be replaced by separate apps, namely [[Apple Music (software)|Music]], [[Podcasts (software)|Podcasts]], and [[Apple TV (software)|TV]].
