Protesters repeatedly tried to get near to the office of the prime minister. Thousands of protesters went to media buildings in Istanbul, such as those of HaberTurk, that was airing an interview with the prime minister at that moment.\n\nParticular anger was also provoked by the sighting of several civilians armed with bats and sticks following police on their way to curb protests, apparently with police support. Several videos showed armed civilians aiding police in brutally cracking down on protesters. Some civilians in videos and photos have been linked to positions in Ak Gen\u00e7lik Kollar\u0131, the youth wing of the AKP. The use of AKP members in cracking down fueled further fury against the police and resulted in a bulldozer being hijacked in [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]], [[Istanbul]] and being driven towards police positions. Although initially resulting in police retreat, the bulldozer was finally set alight in the early hours of midnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/06/201362234021816855.html|title=Thousands take part in protests across Turkey|publisher=aljazeera|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nOther cities where violent confrontations occurred between protesters and police were Adana and Antakya, not far from the Syrian border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/513618-zware-onlusten-in-turkse-steden.html|title=Zware onlusten in Turkse steden|work=Nos.nl|date=2 June 2013|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nReports emerged that the once powerful army faction that remained loyal to the secular establishment that the AKP largely watered down in its influence were distributing gas masks as assistance to protesters.\n\n==3 June==\n\n[[File:Casualties of Taksim protests.

The protests against the road with the attending of most students, [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s and support of [[Peace and Democracy Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s, grew bigger and bigger on the university area, finding tens of thousands, making it the second Gezi of Turkey in about 3 and a half months. On that day's evening, after police's extreme use of violence against tens of thousands of students, people who came with flowers to plant in the area, citizens in the neighbourhoods near the forest area, thousands of people that walked from the city centre of Ankara, [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s and all the protesters, just like it happened in Gezi Park, made the protests of September blaze and made them spread across the whole country again with the name \"ODT\u00dc\" this time, besides \"Gezi\". Soon after mass protests erupted again across the nation, first deaths have arrived during the protests of September to support ODT\u00dc Resistance, one in Hatay and one in Istanbul, both victims of police brutality and unlawful use of teargas. The protests still continue around the country. Amnesty also made an official declaration telling whole World companies to stop selling Turkey teargas and materials like it because of the illegal and brutal use. Soon after this statement, Turkish officials started their attempts to produce teargas in Turkey directly and got positive answers on the first phase, this led to protests around Turkey and Istanbul too against this latest news on teargas usage of and production of Turkey.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Timeline of the 2013-14 protests in Turkey}}\n[[Category:Gezi Park protests|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n{{update|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe following is a '''timeline of the [[Gezi Park protests]] in Turkey''' of citizens and supporters against actions and plans of the government of [[Turkey]].

He developed soil science in Russia, and was, perhaps the first person to make wide geographical investigations of different soil types.  His great contribution to science was, figuratively, to \"put soils on the map\".\n\nHe introduced the idea that geographical variations in [[soil type]] could be explained in relation not only to geological factors ([[parent material]]), but also to climatic and topographic factors, and the time available for [[pedogenesis]] (soil formation) to operate.  Using these ideas as a basis, he created the first [[soil classification]].  His ideas were quickly taken up by a number of soil scientists, including [[Hans Jenny (pedologist)|Hans Jenny]].\n\nHe worked on soil science, and developed a classification scheme describing [[clorpt|five factors for soil formation]]. He arrived at his theory after extensive field studies on Russian soils in 1883. His most famous work is ''Russian [[Chernozem]]'' (1883). Thanks to Dokuchaev's works a number of Russian soil terms are in the international soil science vocabulary ([[chernozem]], [[podsol]], [[gley soil|gley]], [[solonets]], etc.). \n\nA [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] is named in his honor and the Dokuchaev Award, the equivalent of the [[Nobel Prize]] in the field of Soil Science, was instituted by the International Union of Soil Sciences.\n\n== Quote ==\n:''The scientific basis of soil science as a natural science was established by the classical works of Dokuchaev. Previously, soil had been considered a product of physicochemical transformations of rocks, a dead substrate from which plants derive nutritious mineral elements. Soil and bedrock were in fact equated.\n\n:''Dokuchaev considers the soil as a natural body having its own genesis and its own history of development, a body with complex and multiform processes taking place within it. The soil is considered as different from bedrock. The latter becomes soil under the influence of a series of soil-formation factors (climate, vegetation, parent material, relief and age). According to him, soil should be called the \"daily\" or outward horizons of rocks regardless of the type; they are changed naturally by the common effect of water, air and various kinds of living and dead organisms.<ref>[http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010112Krasil/010112krasil.intro.html Krasilnikov, N.A. 1958.

The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings. The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969, and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft. Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle/wing fairings, and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats.

Gregoire's team and CFM solved the problem by reducing the size of the fan (which made the engine slightly less efficient than it had been forecast to be), placing the engine ahead of the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides of the engine pod, giving the engine a distinctive non-circular \"hamster [[Cheek pouch|pouch]]\" air intake.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=128|ps=}}<ref>Sweetman, Bill, All mouth, Air & Space, September 2014, p.14</ref> Earlier customers for the CFM56 included the U.S. Air Force with its program to re-engine KC-135 tankers.<ref>Garvin, Robert V. \"Starting Something Big - The Commercial Emergence of GE Aircraft Engines\", American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The 737 Classic series featured [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] [[turbofan]] engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise over the [[JT8D]] engines used on the \u2212100 and \u2212200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier [[CFM International|CFMI]] solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=128|ps=}}\n\nThe wing also incorporated changes for improved aerodynamics. The engines' accessory [[gearbox]] was moved from the 6 o'clock position under the engine to the 4 o'clock position (from a front/forward looking aft perspective). This side-mounted gearbox gives the engine a somewhat triangular rounded shape. Because the engine is close to the ground, 737-300s and later models are more prone to engine [[foreign object damage]] (FOD). The improved [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-7]] turbofan engine on the 737 Next Generation is 7% more fuel-efficient than the previous CFM56-3 in the 737 classics. The newest 737 variants, the 737 MAX family, feature [[CFM International LEAP-X|CFM International LEAP-1B]] engines with a {{convert|1.73|m|in|order=flip}} fan diameter.

The 737 Classic series featured [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] [[turbofan]] engines, which yielded significant gains in fuel economy and a reduction in noise over the [[JT8D]] engines used on the \u2212100 and \u2212200, but also posed an engineering challenge given the low ground clearance of the 737. Boeing and engine supplier [[CFM International|CFMI]] solved the problem by placing the engine ahead of (rather than below) the wing, and by moving engine accessories to the sides (rather than the bottom) of the engine pod, giving the 737 a distinctive non-circular air intake.{{sfn|Endres|2001|p=128|ps=}}\n\nThe wing also incorporated changes for improved aerodynamics. The engines' accessory [[gearbox]] was moved from the 6 o'clock position under the engine to the 4 o'clock position (from a front/forward looking aft perspective). This side-mounted gearbox gives the engine a somewhat triangular rounded shape. Because the engine is close to the ground, 737-300s and later models are more prone to engine [[foreign object damage]] (FOD). The improved [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56-7]] turbofan engine on the 737 Next Generation is 7% more fuel-efficient than the previous CFM56-3 in the 737 classics.
