McGillivray was a contemporary of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. She encouraged the influential Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].\n\nIn the 1920s, McGillivrays career exploded. Her art mainly was influenced by the Post-Impressionist and Fauvist movements. McGillivray lived in Whitby, Ottawa and Toronto but travelled often to pursue her work. She visited Europe, Alaska, Jamaica and Trinidad. Exhibition locations include Toronto Malloney's, Continental Galleries, Montreal, and her own studio in her hometown.\n\nThe National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the Agnes Etherington Art Centre and galleries in Oshawa, Whitby, Kitchener, London, and Windsor all hold her work in their collections. McGillivray was an Associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy and a member of many associations such as the Ontario Society of Artists, the New York Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour as well as an Associate Member of the Royal Canadian Academy.<ref name=\":0\" /> Florence Helena McGillivray died in Toronto on May 7, 1938, and is buried at Union Cemetery, Oshawa.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Florence H. Mc Gillivray.png|thumb|Florence Helena McGillivray, 1907]]\n\nFlorence Helena McGillivray was born in the small farm town of [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]], Ontario on March 1, 1864. She was the eleventh of thirteen children, and the youngest female of the Scottish immigrant farmer, George McGillivray (1813-1894) and his wife, Caroline Amelia Fothergill McGillivray (1828-1909). McGillivray had three close siblings; Elizabeth Fothergill McGillivray Hillary (1847-1877), Mary Eliza McGillivray (1849-1911) and William McGillivray (1865-1904).\n\nIn 1870, the family moved to Inverlynn, a house located at 1300 Gifford Street in Whitby, Ontario. To this day, the property has remained in the possession of George McGillivray`s descendants. The children attended a grammar school in Whitby, and she had shown artistic talent in her early childhood years so she pursued her art by attending The Central Ontario School of Art, where she studied under Professor [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]]. Florence then began taking one-on-one lessons from renowned Canadian artists such as [[Farquhar McGillivray Knowles]] and [[Lucius O\u2019Brien]] to name only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvhs.ca/publications/utga-following-florence.html|title=A Bridge A-Building|website=www.gvhs.ca|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref> \n\n== Education ==\nAfter studying at the Ontario School of Art, McGillivray had private lessons with J.W.L.

She had a brilliant and unusual handling of brushwork that created unique compositions.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nShe was one of the first women artists to explore the landscape of northern Ontario and Quebec.

A majority of the republic's residents are the descendants of people from [[India]]. Mauritius also contains substantial populations from continental [[Africa]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], and the East African island nation of [[Madagascar]] among other places.\n\n==Ethnic groups==\n[[Indo-Mauritians]] make up approximately two-thirds of the population. The Indo-Mauritian population consists of Hindus, Tamils, Muslims and a Christian minority.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Mauritian Creole people|Creoles]] (of African descent or mixed-race) make up a quarter of the population.<ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mp.html#People|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=2017-08-29}}</ref> . Nowadays, a significant proportion of [[Mauritian Creole people|Creoles]] also have some degree of Indian, White or Chinese lineage. [[Rodrigues|Rodriguais]] and [[Chagossians]] are usually incorporated within the creole ethnic group. Mauritian Creoles form about 30% of the local population.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Franco-Mauritian]]s (Mauritian of [[French people|French]] ancestry) are numbered about 42,000.{{cn|date=April 2020}} [[Franco-Mauritian]]s are the descendants of former French colonists/settlers,  comprising the largest group of people of European origin of the island.<ref>{{harvnb|Eriksen|2004|p=80}}</ref> There is a smaller population of people of British descent living in Mauritius, most of whom have been absorbed within the [[Franco-Mauritian]] community.{{cn|date=April 2020}} There is also a considerable number of white foreign expatriates living in Mauritius, about 8000 are from France and 2000 from South Africa.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAlong with the French European community, there is a small amount of British expatriates or people of British descent in Mauritius.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/brits_abroad/html/africa.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Special Reports {{!}} Brits Abroad|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/indian-ocean/mp-forrel-uk.htm|title=Mauritius - UK Relations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThere are approximately 28,000 [[Sino-Mauritian]]s from the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and other Chinese sub-ethnic/linguistic groups.<ref name=\"Eriksen 1998 82\">{{harvnb|Eriksen|1998|p=82}}</ref>\n\nWhile the government officially groups Mauritians in four ethnic groups: Hindus, Muslims, Chinese and general population, the general population gathers all that don't practice the Hindu or Muslim religion, or are not Chinese by race. Hence general population is the Christian community, which includes whites, coloureds, blacks, and those who have converted to Christianity. The exception to the rule is that the general population does not include the Christian-Chinese, although most practice a mix of Christianity and traditional Chinese religions.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nSmall groups of foreign students from Europe or the Indian Ocean region are also present. Recent years have seen a steady flow of foreign workers into the textile industry (primarily Chinese women), the construction industry (primarily Indian workers), and harbour-related activities (primarily Taiwanese men). Immigration policy does not provoke much debate in Mauritius, and the relative economic stability of the island serves to attract foreign workers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n==Population==\n[[Image:Mauritius demography.png|thumb|450px|Mauritius's population, 1961-2003.]]\n\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Mauritius}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to 479,000 in 1950.<ref name=\"WPP 2010\"/>\n\nThe proportion of the population aged under 15 was 21.9% in 2010.<ref name=\"WPP 2010\"/> 71.2% were between 15 and 65 years of age, with 6.9% being 65 years or older.<ref name=\"WPP 2010\">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision|date=6 May 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=29 August 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506000000/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|archivedate=6 May 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!\n!

The case was then analyzed by the Supreme Military Court.

We need to adopt a rigid birth control policy. We can't make demagogic speeches any longer, proposing bills and means of government to support these poor people [who] are increasingly proliferating throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children, shouldn't have them. This is what I stand for and I'm not worried about getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to contain this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this [[Chamber of Deputies|Chamber]] only matters such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]], loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. Methods [of birth control] have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, are ignorant and have no means to control their offspring.

In 1999, when he was 44 years old and a representative in the Brazilian Congress, Bolsonaro said during a TV interview that the only way of \"changing\" Brazil was by \"killing thirty thousand people, beginning with [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]\" (then President of Brazil).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/politica/republica/o-dia-que-bolsonaro-quis-matar-fhc-sonegar-impostos-e-declarar-guerra-civil-8mtm0u0so6pk88kqnqo0n1l69|title=Bolsonaro sincero quis matar FHC e sonegar impostos|website=Gazeta do Povo}}</ref> During the 2018 campaign, he stated during a rally in [[Acre (state)|Acre]] that the local \"petralhas\" (a derogatory term for members of the Workers' Party) would be \"shot\"; according to his aides, the statement was a \"joke\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/campanha-confirma-video-em-que-bolsonaro-fala-em-fuzilar-petralhada-do-acre-foi-brincadeira-23033857|title=Campanha confirma v\u00eddeo em que Bolsonaro fala em 'fuzilar petralhada do Acre': 'Foi brincadeira'|date=3 September 2018|website=O Globo}}</ref> One week before the second round, Bolsonaro said during a speech that in his administration \"petralhas\" and \"reds\" (i.e. leftists) would be arrested, purged or taken to the \"corner of the beach\", a term that was later revealed to mean a Navy base where dissidents of the [[Brazilian military dictatorship]] were murdered.<ref name=\"uol.com.br\"/>\n\nIn 1999, talking about [[Chico Lopes]], a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank who invoked his right to remain silent during a Congress hearing, Bolsonaro declared himself in favour of torture in this sort of situation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2018/07/31/bolsonaro-roda-viva/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228185717/https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/2018/07/31/bolsonaro-roda-viva/ |archive-date=28 December 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Asked about this phrase years later, Bolsonaro said: \"Ask the father of a kidnapped child what he would like him to do to discover [where the kid is].

Bolsonaro said:\n\n<blockquote>I wish Brazil had a family planning program. It's not even worthy to talk about education when most of these [poor] people are not prepared to receive education, therefore they won't educate themselves. Only rigid birth control can save us from chaos. An educated man and woman will hardly desire an extra child with the sole purpose of engaging in a social welfare assistance program [as it is nowadays]. We need to adopt a rigid birth control policy. We can't make demagogic speeches any longer, proposing bills and means of government to support these poor people [who] are increasingly proliferating throughout the country. [...] People who aren't prepared to have children, shouldn't have them. This is what I stand for and I'm not worried about getting votes in the future. It's past time to discuss a policy to contain this demographic explosion, otherwise, we'll keep voting in this [[Chamber of Deputies|Chamber]] only matters such as [[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]], loans for the poor, gas vouchers, etc. Methods [of birth control] have to be provided for those who, unfortunately, are ignorant and have no means to control their offspring. Because we [as upper-middle class] can control ours. Poor people don't control [theirs].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opovo.com.br/noticias/politica/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-como-forma-de-combater-miseria-e-crim.html|title=Bolsonaro defendeu esteriliza\u00e7\u00e3o de pobres como forma de combater mis\u00e9ria e criminalidade|last=Online|first=O POVO|website=Opovo.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-stabbing-video-president-candidate-juiz-de-fora-minas-gerais-a8526726.html|title='Brazil's Donald Trump' critically injured in presidential campaign rally stabbing|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/2018-06-14-forced-sterilisation-of-brazilian-woman-sparks-uproar/|title='Forced' sterilisation of Brazilian woman sparks uproar|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-de-pobres-para-combater-miseria-e-crime.shtml|title=Bolsonaro defendeu esteriliza\u00e7\u00e3o de pobres para combater mis\u00e9ria e crime|date=2018-06-11|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-10-18|language=pt-BR}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs a Congressman, Bolsonaro put forward three bills trying to remove \"virtually all\" legal restrictions to surgical sterilisation via the public health system, including the reduction of \"the minimum age of sterilization to 21 years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/bolsonaro-defendeu-esterilizacao-de-pobres-para-combater-miseria-e-crime.shtml|title=Bolsonaro defendeu esteriliza\u00e7\u00e3o de pobres para combater mis\u00e9ria e crime|date=11 June 2018|website=Folha de S.Paulo}}</ref> None of the bills were voted.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Bolsonaro e filhos.jpg|thumb|Bolsonaro and two of his sons, Eduardo and Fl\u00e1vio, in the late 1980s]]\nBolsonaro is married to his third wife and has five children.

Wilma is tempted to drift away from her usual playmates Freddy, Barney and Betty and join up with a gang of older kids who use drugs. Wilma resists the peer-pressure tactics of pre-teen pothead Stoney and instead seeks advice from her parents, who tell her that a real friend wouldn't offer her drugs. To the tune of [[La Toya Jackson]]'s original composition, \"Just Say No,\" Wilma, Freddy and the others establish their own \"Just Say No\" club.\n\nNext, Freddy starts up a pet cleaning service to raise ticket money for the upcoming Michael Jackstone concert. But Freddy's [[get-rich-quick scheme]] falls through due to Stoney and his gang tampering of the instructions for each pet. After figuring out what the other kids did, the children realize that their only hope of obtaining tickets is to beat Stoney and his gang at the upcoming Riddle Rally, to which they succeeded. Stoney was later arrested for drug usage. The program concludes with a version of Michael Jackson's hit song \"[[Beat It]],\" with the lyrics specially rewritten to convey an anti-drug theme.\n\nThis special also features comments from then-[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]], Honorary Chair of the \"[[Just Say No|Just Say No Foundation]]\", who offers a message of support to children who have chosen to live a drug-free life.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Scott Menville]] as [[Fred Flintstone|Freddy Flintstone]], Clyde\n*[[Elizabeth Fraser]] as [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma Slaghoople]]\n*[[Hamilton Camp]] as [[Barney Rubble]]\n*[[B.
