It is a broad field, covering a myriad of different areas but is often referenced alongside computer science because of the incredibly useful nature of computers and computer programs in helping those studying and doing research in the field \u2013 particularly in helping to analyse data<ref>http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/jason.frand/teacher/technologies/palace/datamining.htm</ref> and in spotting patterns too broad for a human to intuitively perceive. While information science is sometimes confused with information theory, the two have vastly different subject matter. Information theory focuses on one particular mathematical concept of information while information science is focused on all aspects of the processes and techniques of information.\n\n''Computer science'', in contrast, is less focused on information and its different states, but more, in a very broad sense, on the use of computers \u2013 both in theory and practice \u2013 to design and implement [[algorithm]]s in order to aid the processing of information during the different states described above. It has strong foundations in the field of mathematics, as the very first recognised practitioners of the field were renowned mathematicians such as [[Alan Turing]].\n\nInformation science and computing began to converge in the 1950s and 1960s, as information scientists started to realize the many ways computers would improve information storage and retrieval.\n\n==Terminology==\nDue to the distinction between computers and computing, some of the research groups refer to ''computing'' or ''datalogy''. The French refer to computer science as the term ''[[:fr:Informatique |informatique]]''. The term ''information and communications technology'' (ICT), refers to how humans communicate with using machines and computers, making a distinction from ''information and computer science'', which is how computers use and gain information.\n\nInformatics is also distinct from ''computer science'', which encompasses the study of logic and low-level computing issues.\n\n==Education==\nUniversities may confer degrees of ICS and CIS, not to be confused with a more specific [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] or respective graduate computer science degrees.\n\nThe QS World University Rankings is one of the most widely recognised and distinguished university comparisons.

The city is located in [[Flanders]], the [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] northern portion of Belgium. Belgium has [[Languages of Belgium|three official languages]].</ref>\n\nThe breed is used as a working dog for tasks including detection of odors such as explosives, accelerants (for arson investigation), and narcotics; tracking humans for suspect apprehension in police work; and search and rescue missions.

The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the [[German Shepherd]].<ref name=\"akc.org\"/>\n\n===Coat and colour ===its colour is the colour of poo, this dog poos a lot as well.a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colours of pure-bred Malinois are a base colour fawn to mahogany and tan with a [[melanistic mask|black mask]] and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The colour tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois.\n\nThe other varieties of Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colours: the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervuren)|Tervuren]] is the same colour as the Malinois but has long hair, the wire-coated [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Laekenois)|Laekenois]] is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Groenendael)|Groenendael]] (registered as Belgian Sheepdog by the American Kennel Club) has long hair and is solid black. When the Malinois was first bred, the four breeds would usually be cross bred; this would result in Malinois with longer hair, or even a darker coat. Today the four breeds are considered different breeds.\n\n===Size===\nMales are about {{convert|61|-|66|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while females are about {{convert|56|-|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the [[withers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/standard.aspx?id=5112 |title=Breed Standard |publisher=The Kennel Club |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Female Malinois average {{convert|20|-|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; males are heavier at {{convert|25|-|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FCI\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Belgian Malinois 01.jpg|A Malinois with a black mask\nFile:Belgian Malinois Male Puppy.jpg|A four-month-old male Belgian Malinois\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Malinois in ring competition Belgium - Apr 2005.jpg|thumbnail|A Malinois in the ring competing in dog agility]]\n\nWell-raised and trained Malinois are usually active, intelligent,<ref name = \"BSDCC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsdcc.org/faq.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Belgian Shepherd Dog Club of Canada  |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref><ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/><ref name = Northern/> friendly,<ref name = BSDCC/> protective,<ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/> alert and hard-working.

The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the [[German Shepherd]].<ref name=\"akc.org\"/>\n\n===Coat and colour ===\nDue to its history as a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colours of pure-bred Malinois are a base colour fawn to mahogany and tan with a [[melanistic mask|black mask]] and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The colour tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois.\n\nThe other varieties of Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colours: the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervuren)|Tervuren]] is the same colour as the Malinois but has long hair, the wire-coated [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Laekenois)|Laekenois]] is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Groenendael)|Groenendael]] (registered as Belgian Sheepdog by the American Kennel Club) has long hair and is solid black. When the Malinois was first bred, the four breeds would usually be cross bred; this would result in Malinois with longer hair, or even a darker coat. Today the four breeds are considered different breeds.\n\n===Size===\nMales are about {{convert|61|-|66|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while females are about {{convert|56|-|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the [[withers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/standard.aspx?id=5112 |title=Breed Standard |publisher=The Kennel Club |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Female Malinois average {{convert|20|-|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; males are heavier at {{convert|25|-|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FCI\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"150\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Belgian Malinois 01.jpg|A Malinois with a black mask\nFile:Belgian Malinois Male Puppy.jpg|A four-month-old male Belgian Malinois\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Malinois in ring competition Belgium - Apr 2005.jpg|thumbnail|A Malinois in the ring competing in dog agility]]\n\nWell-raised and trained Malinois are usually active, intelligent,<ref name = \"BSDCC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bsdcc.org/faq.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Belgian Shepherd Dog Club of Canada  |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref><ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/><ref name = Northern/> friendly,<ref name = BSDCC/> protective,<ref name = \"ABMC faq\"/> alert and hard-working.

The university is located on Davit Anhaght street at the [[Kanakerr-Zeytun]] district of Yerevan. Instruction is primarily in [[French language|French]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].\n\n==History==\nAn agreement on cultural, scientific and technical collaboration was signed on 4 November 1995 between [[Armenia]] and [[France]]. This collaboration was followed by a protocol of 23 November 1998 which was concluded between Ministry of Education of RA and the Embassy of France in Armenia. Artur Baghdasaryan and the government of Armenia has its participation in the establishment of French University in Armenia Foundation (UFAR), taking into consideration the need to improve the educational system and fulfill its rich experience in higher and vocational education programs in the field.\n\nFounder - Artur Baghdasaryan\n\n==Academic culture==\nFrom the outset UFAR has become the lighthouse of collaboration with France and the mainstay of [[Francophonie]] in Armenia.\n\nThe pedagogic principle of granting two Armenian and French state diplomas (Bachelor's and master's degrees) was adopted from the beginning. The duration of studies is four years in the bachelor's degree and two years in the master's degree, considering the peculiarities of the transition stage the Armenian universities are in before they entirely adopt the [[Bologna Process|Bologna system]].\n \nFrench University in Armenia Foundation, which has approximately 1,000 students, aims to prepare highly qualified specialists that correspond to the needs of Armenian labor market and [[Caucasus|Caucasia]] economic region. The graduates of UFAR apply their knowledge to the advantage of relationships between Armenia, France and Europe, as well as the development of Armenia. They are the leaders and managers of tomorrow. At the end of their studies each year, roughly 70% of graduates find a job in their profession, some of whom pursue their education abroad. In three years\u2019 time this percentage amounts to almost 100.\n\nThe UFAR, which according to Armenian law is a foundation, favors the support of Armenian authorities: Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for instance, instructs in the university. The chairman of the Board of Trustees is the secretary of National Security Council (i.e., the third figure in authority), who is also one of the founders of UFAR. Most of the ministers\u2019 and state high-ranking officials\u2019 children prefer to study here.\n\nThe UFAR broadens the scope of its presence in Armenian university life due to its collaboration with other universities in the country.\n\nThe UFAR is a unique institution. In contrast to other institutions awarding French diplomas, Cairo University, for example, which has only a French pro-rector, and the Hanoi Francophone Institute of Information Science, the rector and secretary general must be French according to UFAR regulation. By the decision of the Ministry of External and European Affairs of France from this year on{{when|date=March 2015}} a position for an international volunteer has been made available.\n\n==Faculties==\nAs of 2017, UFAR is home to 4 faculties:\n*Faculty of Law,\n*Faculty of Management, \n*Faculty of Finance, \n*Faculty of Marketing.\n\nThe university awards bachelor's degrees in law, economics, management, finance, as well as in international business law, sales and marketing, finance and auditing. Starting from this year{{when|date=March 2015}} one-year Master's graduate diplomas for the newly opened faculty of Cultural Communication, Tourism and Management commissioned by the government of Armenia.\n\nThe knowledge of [[French language|French]] is not obligatory in entering the university. During the first two years of study the students cover public education and professional subjects and have intensive French classes. The knowledge gained is checked or assessed through an internationally recognized test. The further continuation of study is conditioned by the test results. Thus, 85% of students, who before entering the UFAR had not studied French, starting from the third year become capable of proceeding with their studies in French.\n\nThanks to professors from [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3]] and [[Toulouse 1 University Capitole]] at least 20% of studies at undergraduate (starting from the third year) and about 50% of those at graduate level are conducted in French.\n\nAfter having done their obligatory internship in France, Belgium or Armenia, students submit their graduation paper and orally defend it. The students in this respect demonstrate their capabilities in formulating in writing their assignment accomplished and in defending their graduation thesis in French.\n\nAmong the advantages of this institution, closely collaborating with Armenian and French organizations and French local self-government bodies, are entrance competition, French and Armenian teaching staff, the significant role of Armenian Diaspora, as well as institutional partners. Tuition fees are calculated in accordance with the standard of living of Armenia.

The university is located on Davit Anhaght street at the [[Kanakerr-Zeytun]] district of Yerevan. Instruction is primarily in [[French language|French]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]].\n\n==History==\nAn agreement on cultural, scientific and technical collaboration was signed on 4 November 1995 between [[Armenia]] and [[France]]. This collaboration was followed by a protocol of 23 November 1998 which was concluded between Ministry of Education of RA and the Embassy of France in Armenia. Artur Baghdasaryan and the government of Armenia has its participation in the establishment of French University in Armenia Foundation (UFAR), taking into consideration the need to improve the educational system and fulfill its rich experience in higher and vocational education programs in the field.\n\nFounder - Artur Baghdasaryan\n\n==Academic culture==\nFrom the outset UFAR has become the lighthouse of collaboration with France and the mainstay of [[Francophonie]] in Armenia.\n\nThe pedagogic principle of granting two Armenian and French state diplomas (Bachelor's and master's degrees) was adopted from the beginning. The duration of studies is four years in the bachelor's degree and two years in the master's degree, considering the peculiarities of the transition stage the Armenian universities are in before they entirely adopt the [[Bologna Process|Bologna system]].\n \nFrench University in Armenia Foundation, which has approximately 1,000 students, aims to prepare highly qualified specialists that correspond to the needs of Armenian labor market and [[Caucasus|Caucasia]] economic region. The graduates of UFAR apply their knowledge to the advantage of relationships between Armenia, France and Europe, as well as the development of Armenia. They are the leaders and managers of tomorrow. At the end of their studies each year, roughly 70% of graduates find a job in their profession, some of whom pursue their education abroad. In three years\u2019 time this percentage amounts to almost 100.\n\nThe UFAR, which according to Armenian law is a foundation, favors the support of Armenian authorities: Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for instance, instructs in the university. The chairman of the Board of Trustees is the secretary of National Security Council (i.e., the third figure in authority), who is also one of the founders of UFAR. Most of the ministers\u2019 and state high-ranking officials\u2019 children prefer to study here.\n\nThe UFAR broadens the scope of its presence in Armenian university life due to its collaboration with other universities in the country.\n\nThe UFAR is a unique institution. In contrast to other institutions awarding French diplomas, Cairo University, for example, which has only a French pro-rector, and the Hanoi Francophone Institute of Information Science, the rector and secretary general must be French according to UFAR regulation. By the decision of the Ministry of External and European Affairs of France from this year on{{when|date=March 2015}} a position for an international volunteer has been made available.\n\n==Faculties==\nAs of 2017, UFAR is home to 4 faculties:\n*Faculty of Law,\n*Faculty of Management, \n*Faculty of Finance, \n*Faculty of Marketing.\n\nThe university awards bachelor's degrees in law, economics, management, finance, as well as in international business law, sales and marketing, finance and auditing. Starting from this year{{when|date=March 2015}} one-year Master's graduate diplomas for the newly opened faculty of Cultural Communication, Tourism and Management commissioned by the government of Armenia.\n\nThe knowledge of [[French language|French]] is not obligatory in entering the university. During the first two years of study the students cover public education and professional subjects and have intensive French classes. The knowledge gained is checked or assessed through an internationally recognized test. The further continuation of study is conditioned by the test results. Thus, 85% of students, who before entering the UFAR had not studied French, starting from the third year become capable of proceeding with their studies in French.\n\nThanks to professors from [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3]] and [[Toulouse 1 University Capitole]] at least 20% of studies at undergraduate (starting from the third year) and about 50% of those at graduate level are conducted in French.\n\nAfter having done their obligatory internship in France, Belgium or Armenia, students submit their graduation paper and orally defend it. The students in this respect demonstrate their capabilities in formulating in writing their assignment accomplished and in defending their graduation thesis in French.\n\nAmong the advantages of this institution, closely collaborating with Armenian and French organizations and French local self-government bodies, are entrance competition, French and Armenian teaching staff, the significant role of Armenian Diaspora, as well as institutional partners. Tuition fees are calculated in accordance with the standard of living of Armenia. The UFAR provides scholarships of excellence to its best students, enabling them to fully or partially pay for their tuition fees, as well as those with social conditions owing to private donors or organizations.\n\n== Chairs ==\n* Chair of French language\n* Chair of languages\n* Chair of law\n* Chair of Finance and Accounting\n* Chair of Economics\n* Chair of Marketing\n* Chair of Humanitarian and Social studies\n* Chair of Sports\n\n==Partners==\nThe university cooperates with the organization of European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), which gives qualification to organizations that best prepare specialties in Management.
