{"title_page": "Penrose triangle", "text_new": "{{short description|Impossible object}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Impossible triangle|Impossible trinity}}\n[[Image:Penrose-dreieck.svg|thumb|250px|Penrose triangle]]\nThe '''Penrose triangle''', also known as the '''Penrose tribar''' or the '''impossible tribar''',<ref>Pappas, T. \"The Impossible Tribar.\" The Joy of Mathematics. San Carlos, CA: Wide World Publ./Tetra, p. 13, 1989.</ref> is a triangular [[impossible object]], an [[optical illusion]] consisting of an object which can be depicted in a perspective drawing, but cannot exist as a solid object. It was first created by the Swedish artist [[Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd]] in 1934. Independently from Reutersv\u00e4rd, the triangle was made from unicorn sprinkles and cupcakes and rainbows in the 1950s by psychiatrist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son, prominent mathematician [[Roger Penrose]], who described it as \"impossibility in its purest form\". It is featured prominently in the works of artist [[M. C.

San Carlos, CA: Wide World Publ./Tetra, p. 13, 1989.</ref> is a triangular [[impossible object]], an [[optical illusion]] consisting of an object which can be depicted in a perspective drawing, but cannot exist as a solid object. It was first created by the Swedish artist [[Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd]] in 1934. Independently from Reutersv\u00e4rd, the triangle was devised and popularized in the 1950s by psychiatrist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son, prominent mathematician [[Roger Penrose]], who described it as \"impossibility in its purest form\". It is featured prominently in the works of artist [[M. C.

{"title_page": "Economy of the Iroquois", "text_new": "{{pp-move-indef}}\n[[Image:Iroquois women work.JPG|thumb|Iroquois women grinding corn or dried berries; note infant on [[cradleboard]] in background (1664 engraving)]]\nThe '''economy of the Iroquois''' (also known as ''Haudenosaunee'') historically was based on communal production and combined elements of both [[horticulture]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] systems. Some have described the Iroquois economy as [[primitive communism]]{{sfn|Morgan, L. H. 1881. Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.}}. The [[tribe]]s of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] and other Northern [[Iroquoian la-speaking peoples, including the Huron people|Huron]] had their traditional territory in what is now [[New York (state)|New York State]] and the southern areas bordering the [[Great Lakes]]. The confederacy was originally composed of five tribes; the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca, who had created an alliance long before [[Europeancolonization of the Americas|European contact]]. The Tuscarora were added as a sixth nation in the early eighteenth century after they migrated from North Carolina. The Huron peoples, located mostly in what is now Canada, were also Iroquioan-speaking and shared some culture, but were never part of the Iroquois.\n\nThe Iroquoian people were predominantly agricultural, harvesting the \"[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]\" commonly grown by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups: [[corn]], [[bean]]s, and [[Squash (fruit)|squash]]. They developed certain cultural customs. Among these developments were ideas concerning the nature and management of [[property]]. The Iroquois developed a system very different from the now-dominant Western variety. This system was characterized by such components as [[common ownership]] of land, [[division of labor]] by gender, and [[trade]] mostly based on [[gift economy]].\n\nContact with Europeans in the early 17th century had a profound impact on the economy of the Iroquoians. At first, they became important trading partners, but the expansion of European settlement upset the balance of the Iroquois economy. By 1800, following the American Revolutionary War, in which most of the nations supported the British and had to share their defeat, the Iroquois were reduced to [[Indian reservation|reservations]], primarily in New York in the United States, and Quebec and Ontario in Canada. They had to adapt their traditional economic system to dramatic changes. In the 20th century, some of the Iroquois nations in the United States have benefited from their sovereign status by founding gambling and recreation facilities, which have yielded greater revenues than some other enterprises. Individually, Iroquois have also become part of the larger economies in cities off the reservation.\n\n== Land ownership ==\n[[Image:Long House Iroquois Allen.jpg|thumb|Latter-day Iroquois longhouse housing several hundred people.]]\nThe Iroquois had an essentially [[common ownership|communal]] system of land ownership. The French Catholic missionary [[Gabriel Sagard]] described the fundamentals. The Huron had \"as much land as they need[ed].\"{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=110\u2013111}} As a result, the Huron could give families their own land and still have a large amount of excess land owned communally. Any Huron was free to clear the land and farm on the basis of [[usufruct]]. He maintained possession of the land as long as he continued to actively cultivate and tend the fields. Once he abandoned the land, it reverted to communal ownership, and anyone could take it up for themselves.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=111}} While the Huron did seem to have lands designated for the individual, the significance of this possession may be of little relevance; the placement of corn storage vessels in the [[Native American long house|longhouses]], which contained multiple families in one kinship group, suggests the occupants of a given longhouse held all production in common.{{sfn|Trigger|1969|p=28}}\n\nThe Iroquois had a similar communal system of land distribution.  The tribe owned all lands but gave out tracts to the different clans for further distribution among households for cultivation.  The land would be redistributed among the households every few years, and a clan could request a redistribution of tracts when the Clan Mothers' Council gathered.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71\u201372}} Those clans that abused their allocated land or otherwise did not take care of it would be warned and eventually punished by the Clan Mothers' Council by having the land redistributed to another clan.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}} Land property was really only the concern of the women, since it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men's.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nThe Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans.  Food from such lands, called ''k\u011bndi\u01d4\"gw\u01ce'ge' hodi'y\u011bn'tho'', would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}}\n\n== Division of labor: agriculture and forestry ==\nThe [[division of labor]] reflected the complementary aspects common in Iroquois culture:  The twin gods Sapling (East) and Flint (West) embodied the two complementary halves. Each gender had defined roles in labor to support the people, which complemented each other. Women did all work involving the field, including planting, cultivating and harvesting the crops; while men did all work involving the forest, including the manufacture of anything involving wood.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|pp=120\u2013121}} The Iroquois men carried out [[hunting]] and fishing, [[Trade|trading]], and [[fighting]], while the women took care of [[farming]], [[food gathering]] and processing, rearing of children, and [[Household management|housekeeping]]. This gendered division of labor was the predominant means of dividing work in Iroquois society.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=103}} At the time of contact with Europeans, Iroquois women produced about 65% of the goods and the men 35%.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=122}} The combined production of food made famine and hunger extremely rare; early Europeans settlers often envied the success of Iroquois food production.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=122}}\n\nThe Iroquois system of work reflected their communal land system. Since the Iroquois owned property together, they worked together as well. The women performed difficult work in large groups, going from field to field helping one another work each other's land.  Together they would sow the fields as a \"mistress of the field\" distributed a set amount of seeds to each of the women.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=124\u2013125}} The Iroquois women of each agricultural group would select an old but active member of their group to act as their leader for that year and agree to follow her directions. The women performed other work cooperatively as well.  The women individually cut wood for family use, but their leader would oversee the collective carrying of the wood back to the village.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=32}} The women's clans performed other work. According to [[Mary Jemison]], a white woman assimilated with the Seneca while a young woman, the collective effort averted \"every jealousy of one having done more or less work than another.\"{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=32}}\n\n[[Image:Huron deer hunt V Champlain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samuel de Champlain]]'s sketch of a Huron deer hunt; Huron men make noise and drive animals along a V-shaped fence towards an apex where they are captured and killed.]]\nThe Iroquois men also organized in a cooperative fashion. The men acted collectively during military actions.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=32\u201333}} The other jobs of men, such as hunting and fishing, also involved cooperative elements. The men more often organized as a whole [[village]] rather than as a [[clan]].{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=33}} The men organized hunting parties where they used extensive cooperation to kill a large amount of game.  One firsthand account told of a hunting party that built a large brush fence in a forest to form a ''V''. The hunters set a fire across from the open side of the ''V'', forcing the animals to run towards the point where the hunters awaited them. They could kill one hundred [[deer]] at a time by such a plan.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=36\u201337}}\n\n[[Image:Indians fishing de bry.jpg|thumb|upright|Native Americans of unknown tribe fishing in fashion similar to Iroquois.]]\nThe men also fished in large groups. Fishing expeditions included men in [[canoes]] using [[Fishing weir|weirs]] and [[Fishing net|nets]] to cover entire streams and harvest large amounts of fish, sometimes a thousand in half of a day.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=37\u201338}} A hunting or fishing party's takings were considered common property; they were divided among the party by the leader or taken to the village for a feast.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=70}} Hunting and fishing were not always cooperative efforts, but the Iroquois generally did better in parties than as individuals.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=30}}\n\n== Trade ==\nThe Iroquois traded excess corn and tobacco for the pelts from the tribes to the north and the [[wampum]] from the tribes to the east.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=79\u201380}} The Iroquois used [[present-giving]] more often than any other mode of exchange.  Present-giving reflected the [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] in Iroquois society. The exchange would begin with one clan giving another tribe or clan a present with the expectation of some sort of needed commodity being given in return. This form of trade ties to the Iroquois culture's tendency to share property and cooperate in labor. In all cases no explicit agreement is made, but one service is performed for the community or another member of the community's good with the expectation that the community or another individual would give back.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=81}} External trade offered one of the few opportunities for individual enterprise in Iroquois society. A person who discovered a new trading route had the exclusive right to trade along the same route in the future. Often clans collectivized trading routes to gain a monopoly on a certain type of trade.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=80}}\n\n[[Image:Iroquois western goods.jpg|thumb|left|Iroquois with Western goods, presumably acquired through trade (French engraving, 1722)]]\nThe arrival of Europeans created the opportunity for greatly expanded trade. Furs were in demand in Europe, and they could be acquired cheaply from Indians in exchange for manufactured goods the Indians could not make themselves.{{sfn|Caskey et al.|2001}} Trade did not always benefit the Natives.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] took advantage of the gift-giving culture. They showered the Iroquois with European goods, making them dependent on such items as rifles and metal axes. For a time, the access to guns gave the Mohawk and other Iroquois advantages over other tribes, and they entered trading seriously. The British primarily used these gifts to gain support among the Iroquois for fighting against the French.{{sfn|Johansen|1982|loc=chapter 3}}\n\nThe Iroquois also traded for alcohol, which the Europeans introduced. Eventually, this would have a very negative influence on their society, as they suffered a high rate of alcoholism. By 1753 Scarrooyady, a chief, petitioned the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] to intervene in trade: \n<blockquote>\"Your Traders now bring scarce anything but Rum and Flour; they bring little powder and lead, or other valuable goods . . . and get all the skins that should go to pay the debts we have contracted for goods bought of the Fair Traders; by this means we not only ruin ourselves but them too. These wicked Whiskey Sellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them sell their very clothes from their backs. In short, if this practice be continued, we must be inevitably ruined.\"{{sfn|Caskey et al.|2001}}</blockquote>\n\n== Effect on Iroquois culture and society ==\nThe structure of the Iroquois economy created a unique property and [[work ethic]]. The threat of theft was almost nonexistent, since little was held by the individual except basic tools and implements that were so prevalent they had little value. The only goods worth stealing would have been [[wampum]].{{sfn|Speck|1945|pp=31\u201332}} While a theft-free society can be respected by all, communal systems such as that of the Iroquois are often criticized for providing less of an incentive to work. In order for the Iroquois to succeed without an individual incentive, they had to develop a communal work ethic. Virtue became synonymous with productivity. The idealized Iroquois man was a good warrior and productive hunter while the perfect woman excelled in agriculture and housekeeping.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=144\u2013145}} By emphasizing an individual's usefulness to society, the Iroquois created a mindset that encouraged their members to contribute even though they received similar benefits no matter how hard they worked.\n\nAs a result of their communal system, some would expect the Iroquois to have a culture of dependence without individuality. The Iroquois, however, had a strong tradition of autonomous responsibility. Iroquois men were taught to be self-disciplined, self-reliant, and responsible as well as stoic.{{sfn|Wallace|1969|p=30}} The Iroquois attempted to eliminate any feelings of dependency during childhood and foster a desire for responsibility. At the same time, the child would have to participate in a communal culture, children were taught to think as individuals but work for the community.{{sfn|Wallace|1969|p=34}}\n\n== Land management after the Europeans arrived ==\nThe Iroquois system of land management changed somewhat after encounter with the Europeans. The Mohawk were the first to deal with them and \"sold\" some land to settlers, although it is unlikely either side understood the other's conception of property.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], the victorious Americans forced the nations into reservations much reduced in size from their former territories, even those two, the Oneida and Onondaga, that had supported them.  Most of the other Iroquois nations were forced to give up their territory and retreated to Canada, where they received some land in compensation from the Crown, in addition to existing settlements along the St. Lawrence River.\n\nThe Iroquois had a system of collectively owned land free to be used as needed by their members.  While this system was not wholly collective, as land was distributed for use to individual family groups, the Iroquois lacked the Western conception of property as a [[commodity]].{{sfn|Noon|1949|p={{page needed|date=September 2013}}}} Despite the influence of Western culture, the Iroquois have maintained a unique view of property over the years.\n\nThe contemporary Mohawk [[Doug George-Kanentiio]] sums up his perception of the Iroquois property view: The Iroquois have \n<blockquote>\"no absolute right to claim territory for purely monetary purposes. Our Creator gave us our aboriginal lands in trust with very specific rules regarding its uses.  We are caretakers of our Mother Earth, not lords of the land. Our claims are valid only so far as we dwell in peace and harmony upon her.\"{{sfn|George-Kanentiio|2000|pp=169\u2013170}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1981 the Iroquois Council of Chiefs (or Haudenosaunee) expressed similar ideas. The Council distinguished the \n<blockquote>\"Western European concepts of land ownership\" from the Iroquois view that \"the earth is sacred\" and \"was created for all to use forever\u2014not to be exploited merely for this present generation.\" Land is not just a commodity and \"In no event is land for sale.\" The statement continues, \"Under Haudenosaunee law, 'Gayanerkowa,' the land is held by the women of each clan. It is principally the women who are responsible for the land, who farm it, and who care for it for the future generations. When the Confederacy was formed, the separate nations formed one union. The territory of each nation became Confederacy land even though each nation continued to have a special interest in its historic territory.\"{{sfn|Council of Chiefs}}</blockquote> The Council's statement reflects its unique view of property among the Iroquois.\n\nThe system of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Grand River Iroquois]] (two Iroquois reservations in Canada) integrated the traditional Iroquois property structure with the new way of life after being confined to a reservation. The reservation was established under two deeds by the Crown in the 18th century following the American Revolutionary War.  These deeds gave corporate ownership of the lands to the Six Nations of the Iroquois.{{sfn|Noon|1949|pp=86\u201388}} Individuals were granted leases for a specific plot by the Confederacy.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=88}} The Iroquois idea that land came into one's possession if cared for and reverted to public control if left alone was used in reservation property law.  In one property dispute case, the Iroquois Council sided with a claimant who had made improvements and cultivated the land over one who had left it alone.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=88}}\n\nThe natural resources of the land are considered to belong to the tribe as a whole and not to those who possessed the particular parcel.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=92}} The Iroquois leased the right to extract stone from the lands in one instance and fixed royalties on all the production.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=94}} After natural gas had been discovered on the reservation, the Six Nations took direct ownership of the natural gas wells. They paid persons who had wells on their land compensation only for damages done by gas extraction.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=94}} This setup closely resembled the precontact land distribution system where the tribes owned the land and distributed it for use, but not unconditional ownership.\n\n== Modern economy ==\n{{update|date=April 2015}}\nMany Iroquois have been fully integrated into the surrounding Western economy of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  For others their economic involvement is more isolated in the [[Indian reservation|reservation]].  Whether directly involved in the outside economy or not, most of the Iroquois economy is now greatly influenced by national and world economies.  The Iroquois have been involved in the steel construction industry for over a hundred years, with many men from the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] nations working on such high-steel projects as the [[Empire State Building]] and the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|National Public Radio|2002}}\n\nInside the reservations, which are sometimes isolated from larger cities, the economic situation has often been bleak.  For instance, the U.S. side of the Mohawk St. Regis reservation in northern New York has recently had [[unemployment]] as high as 46 percent.{{sfn|Herald American|1990}} However, in April of 1999, the St Regis Mohawks opened the [[Akwesasne Mohawk Casino]]. It has since been renovated in 2011 and 2012 to enlarge the hotel, amenities and gaming floor. The casino also employs tribal members and local community members as well.\n\nBut many reservations have successful businesses. The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] reservation contains the [[Salamanca (city), New York|City of Salamanca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], a center of the hardwoods industry.{{sfn|City of Salamanca}} The Seneca make use of their sovereignty to sell gasoline and cigarettes tax-free and run high-stakes [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] operations.{{sfn|Adams|2002}} The Senecas have also opened several [[Indian casino]]s, the [[Seneca Niagara Casino]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] and one in Salamanca. In 2007 the Seneca opened a third in Buffalo, the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.{{sfn|Seneca Gaming Corporation|2007}}\n\nThe [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] also operate casinos on their reservations in New York and [[Wisconsin]].  The Oneida are one of the largest employers in northeastern Wisconsin with over 3,000 employees, including 975 people in tribal government. The Tribe manages more than $16 million in federal and private grants, and a wide range of programs, including those authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.{{sfn|Environmental Protection Agency}} The Oneida business ventures have brought millions of dollars into the community and improved the [[standard of living]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n== See

grinding corn or dried berries; note infant on [[cradleboard]] in background (1664 engraving)]]\nThe '''economy of the Iroquois''' (also known as ''Haudenosaunee'') historically was based on communal production and combined elements of both [[horticulture]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] systems. Some have described the Iroquois economy as [[primitive communism]]{{sfn|Morgan, L. H. 1881. Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.}}. The [[tribe]]s of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] and other Northern [[Iroquoian la-speaking peoples, including the Huron people|Huron]], had their traditional territory in what is now [[New York (state)|New York State]] and the southern areas bordering the [[Great Lakes]]. The confederacy was originally composed of five tribes; the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca, who had created an alliance long before [[Europeancolonization of the Americas|European contact]]. The Tuscarora were added as a sixth nation in the early eighteenth century after they migrated from North Carolina. The Huron peoples, located mostly in what is now Canada, were also Iroquioan-speaking and shared some culture, but were never part of the Iroquois.\n\nThe Iroquoian people were predominantly agricultural, harvesting the \"[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]\" commonly grown by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups: [[corn]], [[bean]]s, and [[Squash (fruit)|squash]]. They developed certain cultural customs. Among these developments were ideas concerning the nature and management of [[property]]. The Iroquois developed a system very different from the now-dominant Western variety. This system was characterized by such components as [[common ownership]] of land, [[division of labor]] by gender, and [[trade]] mostly based on [[gift economy]].\n\nContact with Europeans in the early 17th century had a profound impact on the economy of the Iroquoians. At first, they became important trading partners, but the expansion of European settlement upset the balance of the Iroquois economy. By 1800, following the American Revolutionary War, in which most of the nations supported the British and had to share their defeat, the Iroquois were reduced to [[Indian reservation|reservations]], primarily in New York in the United States, and Quebec and Ontario in Canada. They had to adapt their traditional economic system to dramatic changes. In the 20th century, some of the Iroquois nations in the United States have benefited from their sovereign status by founding gambling and recreation facilities, which have yielded greater revenues than some other enterprises. Individually, Iroquois have also become part of the larger economies in cities off the reservation.\n\n== Land ownership ==\n[[Image:Long House Iroquois Allen.jpg|thumb|Latter-day Iroquois longhouse housing several hundred people.]]\nThe Iroquois had an essentially [[common ownership|communal]] system of land ownership. The French Catholic missionary [[Gabriel Sagard]] described the fundamentals. The Huron had \"as much land as they need[ed].\"{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=110\u2013111}} As a result, the Huron could give families their own land and still have a large amount of excess land owned communally. Any Huron was free to clear the land and farm on the basis of [[usufruct]]. He maintained possession of the land as long as he continued to actively cultivate and tend the fields. Once he abandoned the land, it reverted to communal ownership, and anyone could take it up for themselves.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=111}} While the Huron did seem to have lands designated for the individual, the significance of this possession may be of little relevance; the placement of corn storage vessels in the [[Native American long house|longhouses]], which contained multiple families in one kinship group, suggests the occupants of a given longhouse held all production in common.{{sfn|Trigger|1969|p=28}}\n\nThe Iroquois had a similar communal system of land distribution.  The tribe owned all lands but gave out tracts to the different clans for further distribution among households for cultivation.  The land would be redistributed among the households every few years, and a clan could request a redistribution of tracts when the Clan Mothers' Council gathered.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71\u201372}} Those clans that abused their allocated land or otherwise did not take care of it would be warned and eventually punished by the Clan Mothers' Council by having the land redistributed to another clan.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}} Land property was really only the concern of the women, since it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men's.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nThe Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans.  Food from such lands, called ''k\u011bndi\u01d4\"gw\u01ce'ge' hodi'y\u011bn'tho'', would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=123}}\n\n== Division of labor: agriculture and forestry ==\nThe [[division of labor]] reflected the complementary aspects common in Iroquois culture:  The twin gods Sapling (East) and Flint (West) embodied the two complementary halves. Each gender had defined roles in labor to support the people, which complemented each other. Women did all work involving the field, including planting, cultivating and harvesting the crops; while men did all work involving the forest, including the manufacture of anything involving wood.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|pp=120\u2013121}} The Iroquois men carried out [[hunting]] and fishing, [[Trade|trading]], and [[fighting]], while the women took care of [[farming]], [[food gathering]] and processing, rearing of children, and [[Household management|housekeeping]]. This gendered division of labor was the predominant means of dividing work in Iroquois society.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|p=103}} At the time of contact with Europeans, Iroquois women produced about 65% of the goods and the men 35%.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=122}} The combined production of food made famine and hunger extremely rare; early Europeans settlers often envied the success of Iroquois food production.{{sfn|Johansen|1999|p=122}}\n\nThe Iroquois system of work reflected their communal land system. Since the Iroquois owned property together, they worked together as well. The women performed difficult work in large groups, going from field to field helping one another work each other's land.  Together they would sow the fields as a \"mistress of the field\" distributed a set amount of seeds to each of the women.{{sfn|Axtell|1981|pp=124\u2013125}} The Iroquois women of each agricultural group would select an old but active member of their group to act as their leader for that year and agree to follow her directions. The women performed other work cooperatively as well.  The women individually cut wood for family use, but their leader would oversee the collective carrying of the wood back to the village.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=32}} The women's clans performed other work. According to [[Mary Jemison]], a white woman assimilated with the Seneca while a young woman, the collective effort averted \"every jealousy of one having done more or less work than another.\"{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=32}}\n\n[[Image:Huron deer hunt V Champlain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samuel de Champlain]]'s sketch of a Huron deer hunt; Huron men make noise and drive animals along a V-shaped fence towards an apex where they are captured and killed.]]\nThe Iroquois men also organized in a cooperative fashion. The men acted collectively during military actions.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=32\u201333}} The other jobs of men, such as hunting and fishing, also involved cooperative elements. The men more often organized as a whole [[village]] rather than as a [[clan]].{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=33}} The men organized hunting parties where they used extensive cooperation to kill a large amount of game.  One firsthand account told of a hunting party that built a large brush fence in a forest to form a ''V''. The hunters set a fire across from the open side of the ''V'', forcing the animals to run towards the point where the hunters awaited them. They could kill one hundred [[deer]] at a time by such a plan.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=36\u201337}}\n\n[[Image:Indians fishing de bry.jpg|thumb|upright|Native Americans of unknown tribe fishing in fashion similar to Iroquois.]]\nThe men also fished in large groups. Fishing expeditions included men in [[canoes]] using [[Fishing weir|weirs]] and [[Fishing net|nets]] to cover entire streams and harvest large amounts of fish, sometimes a thousand in half of a day.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=37\u201338}} A hunting or fishing party's takings were considered common property; they were divided among the party by the leader or taken to the village for a feast.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=70}} Hunting and fishing were not always cooperative efforts, but the Iroquois generally did better in parties than as individuals.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=30}}\n\n== Trade ==\nThe Iroquois traded excess corn and tobacco for the pelts from the tribes to the north and the [[wampum]] from the tribes to the east.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=79\u201380}} The Iroquois used [[present-giving]] more often than any other mode of exchange.  Present-giving reflected the [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] in Iroquois society. The exchange would begin with one clan giving another tribe or clan a present with the expectation of some sort of needed commodity being given in return. This form of trade ties to the Iroquois culture's tendency to share property and cooperate in labor. In all cases no explicit agreement is made, but one service is performed for the community or another member of the community's good with the expectation that the community or another individual would give back.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=81}} External trade offered one of the few opportunities for individual enterprise in Iroquois society. A person who discovered a new trading route had the exclusive right to trade along the same route in the future. Often clans collectivized trading routes to gain a monopoly on a certain type of trade.{{sfn|Stites|1905|p=80}}\n\n[[Image:Iroquois western goods.jpg|thumb|left|Iroquois with Western goods, presumably acquired through trade (French engraving, 1722)]]\nThe arrival of Europeans created the opportunity for greatly expanded trade. Furs were in demand in Europe, and they could be acquired cheaply from Indians in exchange for manufactured goods the Indians could not make themselves.{{sfn|Caskey et al.|2001}} Trade did not always benefit the Natives.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] took advantage of the gift-giving culture. They showered the Iroquois with European goods, making them dependent on such items as rifles and metal axes. For a time, the access to guns gave the Mohawk and other Iroquois advantages over other tribes, and they entered trading seriously. The British primarily used these gifts to gain support among the Iroquois for fighting against the French.{{sfn|Johansen|1982|loc=chapter 3}}\n\nThe Iroquois also traded for alcohol, which the Europeans introduced. Eventually, this would have a very negative influence on their society, as they suffered a high rate of alcoholism. By 1753 Scarrooyady, a chief, petitioned the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] to intervene in trade: \n<blockquote>\"Your Traders now bring scarce anything but Rum and Flour; they bring little powder and lead, or other valuable goods . . . and get all the skins that should go to pay the debts we have contracted for goods bought of the Fair Traders; by this means we not only ruin ourselves but them too. These wicked Whiskey Sellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them sell their very clothes from their backs. In short, if this practice be continued, we must be inevitably ruined.\"{{sfn|Caskey et al.|2001}}</blockquote>\n\n== Effect on Iroquois culture and society ==\nThe structure of the Iroquois economy created a unique property and [[work ethic]]. The threat of theft was almost nonexistent, since little was held by the individual except basic tools and implements that were so prevalent they had little value. The only goods worth stealing would have been [[wampum]].{{sfn|Speck|1945|pp=31\u201332}} While a theft-free society can be respected by all, communal systems such as that of the Iroquois are often criticized for providing less of an incentive to work. In order for the Iroquois to succeed without an individual incentive, they had to develop a communal work ethic. Virtue became synonymous with productivity. The idealized Iroquois man was a good warrior and productive hunter while the perfect woman excelled in agriculture and housekeeping.{{sfn|Stites|1905|pp=144\u2013145}} By emphasizing an individual's usefulness to society, the Iroquois created a mindset that encouraged their members to contribute even though they received similar benefits no matter how hard they worked.\n\nAs a result of their communal system, some would expect the Iroquois to have a culture of dependence without individuality. The Iroquois, however, had a strong tradition of autonomous responsibility. Iroquois men were taught to be self-disciplined, self-reliant, and responsible as well as stoic.{{sfn|Wallace|1969|p=30}} The Iroquois attempted to eliminate any feelings of dependency during childhood and foster a desire for responsibility. At the same time, the child would have to participate in a communal culture, children were taught to think as individuals but work for the community.{{sfn|Wallace|1969|p=34}}\n\n== Land management after the Europeans arrived ==\nThe Iroquois system of land management changed somewhat after encounter with the Europeans. The Mohawk were the first to deal with them and \"sold\" some land to settlers, although it is unlikely either side understood the other's conception of property.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolutionary War]], the victorious Americans forced the nations into reservations much reduced in size from their former territories, even those two, the Oneida and Onondaga, that had supported them.  Most of the other Iroquois nations were forced to give up their territory and retreated to Canada, where they received some land in compensation from the Crown, in addition to existing settlements along the St. Lawrence River.\n\nThe Iroquois had a system of collectively owned land free to be used as needed by their members.  While this system was not wholly collective, as land was distributed for use to individual family groups, the Iroquois lacked the Western conception of property as a [[commodity]].{{sfn|Noon|1949|p={{page needed|date=September 2013}}}} Despite the influence of Western culture, the Iroquois have maintained a unique view of property over the years.\n\nThe contemporary Mohawk [[Doug George-Kanentiio]] sums up his perception of the Iroquois property view: The Iroquois have \n<blockquote>\"no absolute right to claim territory for purely monetary purposes. Our Creator gave us our aboriginal lands in trust with very specific rules regarding its uses.  We are caretakers of our Mother Earth, not lords of the land. Our claims are valid only so far as we dwell in peace and harmony upon her.\"{{sfn|George-Kanentiio|2000|pp=169\u2013170}}</blockquote>\n\nIn 1981 the Iroquois Council of Chiefs (or Haudenosaunee) expressed similar ideas. The Council distinguished the \n<blockquote>\"Western European concepts of land ownership\" from the Iroquois view that \"the earth is sacred\" and \"was created for all to use forever\u2014not to be exploited merely for this present generation.\" Land is not just a commodity and \"In no event is land for sale.\" The statement continues, \"Under Haudenosaunee law, 'Gayanerkowa,' the land is held by the women of each clan. It is principally the women who are responsible for the land, who farm it, and who care for it for the future generations. When the Confederacy was formed, the separate nations formed one union. The territory of each nation became Confederacy land even though each nation continued to have a special interest in its historic territory.\"{{sfn|Council of Chiefs}}</blockquote> The Council's statement reflects its unique view of property among the Iroquois.\n\nThe system of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Grand River Iroquois]] (two Iroquois reservations in Canada) integrated the traditional Iroquois property structure with the new way of life after being confined to a reservation. The reservation was established under two deeds by the Crown in the 18th century following the American Revolutionary War.  These deeds gave corporate ownership of the lands to the Six Nations of the Iroquois.{{sfn|Noon|1949|pp=86\u201388}} Individuals were granted leases for a specific plot by the Confederacy.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=88}} The Iroquois idea that land came into one's possession if cared for and reverted to public control if left alone was used in reservation property law.  In one property dispute case, the Iroquois Council sided with a claimant who had made improvements and cultivated the land over one who had left it alone.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=88}}\n\nThe natural resources of the land are considered to belong to the tribe as a whole and not to those who possessed the particular parcel.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=92}} The Iroquois leased the right to extract stone from the lands in one instance and fixed royalties on all the production.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=94}} After natural gas had been discovered on the reservation, the Six Nations took direct ownership of the natural gas wells. They paid persons who had wells on their land compensation only for damages done by gas extraction.{{sfn|Noon|1949|p=94}} This setup closely resembled the precontact land distribution system where the tribes owned the land and distributed it for use, but not unconditional ownership.\n\n== Modern economy ==\n{{update|date=April 2015}}\nMany Iroquois have been fully integrated into the surrounding Western economy of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  For others their economic involvement is more isolated in the [[Indian reservation|reservation]].  Whether directly involved in the outside economy or not, most of the Iroquois economy is now greatly influenced by national and world economies.  The Iroquois have been involved in the steel construction industry for over a hundred years, with many men from the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] nations working on such high-steel projects as the [[Empire State Building]] and the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|National Public Radio|2002}}\n\nInside the reservations, which are sometimes isolated from larger cities, the economic situation has often been bleak.  For instance, the U.S. side of the Mohawk St. Regis reservation in northern New York has recently had [[unemployment]] as high as 46 percent.{{sfn|Herald American|1990}} However, in April of 1999, the St Regis Mohawks opened the [[Akwesasne Mohawk Casino]]. It has since been renovated in 2011 and 2012 to enlarge the hotel, amenities and gaming floor. The casino also employs tribal members and local community members as well.\n\nBut many reservations have successful businesses. The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] reservation contains the [[Salamanca (city), New York|City of Salamanca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], a center of the hardwoods industry.{{sfn|City of Salamanca}} The Seneca make use of their sovereignty to sell gasoline and cigarettes tax-free and run high-stakes [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] operations.{{sfn|Adams|2002}} The Senecas have also opened several [[Indian casino]]s, the [[Seneca Niagara Casino]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] and one in Salamanca. In 2007 the Seneca opened a third in Buffalo, the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.{{sfn|Seneca Gaming Corporation|2007}}\n\nThe [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] also operate casinos on their reservations in New York and [[Wisconsin]].  The Oneida are one of the largest employers in northeastern Wisconsin with over 3,000 employees, including 975 people in tribal government. The Tribe manages more than $16 million in federal and private grants, and a wide range of programs, including those authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.{{sfn|Environmental Protection Agency}} The Oneida business ventures have brought millions of dollars into the community and improved the [[standard of living]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n== See

By contrast, [[McDonald's]] focused on profitability ''at'' the franchise level. Krispy Kreme also had supermarkets and gas stations carry their donuts, which soon contributed up to half of the chain's sales, creating further market saturation as well as increasing competition to its franchisees. All this expansion devalued Krispy Kreme brand's novelty, by making the once-specialty donuts ubiquitous, particularly as the newer sales outlets required pre-made donuts as opposed to the ones made fresh in factory stores, which alienated brand devotees.<ref name=\"cfo\" />\n\nBesides royalty payments from new stores, the parent company also enjoyed significant profits by requiring franchisees to purchase mix and doughnut-making equipment from the parent's Krispy Kreme Manufacturing and Distribution (KKM&D) division. KKM&D earned $152.7 million in 2003, which made up 31 percent of sales, with a reported operating margin of 20 percent or higher, but these mark-ups were largely at the expense of its franchisees. By comparison, rival chain Dunkin' Donuts generally avoids selling equipment or materials to its franchisees which \"keeps company and franchisee interests aligned\", as well as having a royalty stream based on same-store sales.<ref name=\"cfo\" />\n\nKrispy Kreme has been accused of [[channel stuffing]] by franchisees, whose stores reportedly \"received twice their regular shipments in the final weeks of a quarter so that headquarters could make its numbers\".<ref name=\"cfo\" /> The company was also dogged by questionable transactions and self-dealing accusations over the buybacks of franchisees, including those operated by company insiders.<ref name=\"businessweek\" /> A report released in August 2005 singled out then-CEO Scott Livengood and then-COO John W.

The uncle and nephew focused solely on selling their doughnuts and opened \"The Krispy Kreme Doughnut Company\" in a rented store on Gallatin Road.<ref name=Chronicle /> The shop did so well that Vernon's father, Plumie, also left Kentucky and moved to Nashville to help sell doughnuts.\n\nIn 1937, Vernon Rudolph opened his own store, deciding on Winston-Salem, North Carolina for the location when he learned that his favorite cigarette company, [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], was headquartered in the small North Carolina city.<ref name=Chronicle /> Rudolph primarily sold to convenience stores; however, he also sold hot doughnuts to individual customers who came during production time between midnight and 4 a.m.<ref name=Chronicle /> The first store in North Carolina was located in a rented building on South Main Street in Winston-Salem in what is now called historic [[Old Salem]]. The Krispy Kreme logo was designed by Benny Dinkins, a local architect. The first Krispy Kreme bakery outside the South opened in [[Akron, Ohio]], in 1939.\n\nExpansion occurred in the 1950s, including an early store in Savannah, Georgia. By the 1960s, Krispy Kreme was known throughout the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], and it began to expand into other areas. In 1976, Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation became a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[Beatrice Foods]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The headquarters for Krispy Kreme remained in Winston-Salem.\n\nA group of [[Franchising|franchisees]] purchased the corporation back from Beatrice Foods in 1982.\n\nIn May 2016, [[JAB Holding Company|JAB Beech]], a German investment firm, announced it made an offer to purchase the company for $1.35 billion over the following two months that would make the company privately owned.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-krispykreme-m-a-jab-idUSKCN0Y01EM JAB to take Krispy Kreme private for $1.35 billion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603112057/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-krispykreme-m-a-jab-idUSKCN0Y01EM |date=June 3, 2016 }} Reuters, Retrieved May 10, 2016.</ref> The transaction closed on July 27, 2016.

The stock reached what would be its all-time high of $50 on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2003, a gain of 135 percent from its IPO price. For the fiscal year ending in February 2004, the company reported sales of $665.6 million and operating profits of $94.7 million from almost 400 stores (including international locations). The market initially considered the company as having \"solid fundamentals, adding stores at a rapid clip and showing steadily increasing sales and earnings.\"\n<ref name=\"cfo\" /> Since then, it had lost 75-80% of its value by 2005, amid earnings declines, as well as an [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] investigation over the company's alleged improper accounting practices.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jan2005/pi20050119_0925_pi015.htm |title=The Holes in a Krispy Kreme Rally |magazine=Businessweek |accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2004, the company missed quarterly estimates for the first time and suffered its first loss as a public company. Chairman and CEO [[Scott Livengood]] attributed the poor results to the [[low-carbohydrate diet]] craze. This explanation was viewed with skepticism by analysts, as \"blaming the Atkins diet for disappointing earnings carried a whiff of desperation\",<ref name=\"cfo\">{{cite journal |author=O'Sullivan, Kate |url=http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/4007436?f=options |title=Kremed! |via=CFO.com |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2012-08-09 |journal=[[CFO Mag.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115234101/http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/4007436?f=options |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and as rival donut chain, [[Dunkin' Donuts]] has not suffered from the low-carb trend over the same compared period.<ref name=\"businessweek\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_02/b3915649.htm |title=Scott Livengood |magazine=Businessweek |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref>\n\nAnalysts suggested that Livengood had expanded the chain too rapidly after the IPO, which concentrated certain markets with too many stores.<ref name=\"businessweek\" /> While this approach initially grew revenues and profits at the parent-company level, due to royalty payments from new franchisees, which also increased sales, this reduced the profitability of individual franchisees in the long run as they were forced to compete with one another. For the 2003-04 fiscal year, while the parent enjoyed a 15 percent increase in second-quarter revenues, same-store sales increased only a tenth of a percent during that time. By contrast, [[McDonald's]] focused on profitability ''at'' the franchise level. Krispy Kreme also had supermarkets and gas stations carry their donuts, which soon contributed up to half of the chain's sales, creating further market saturation as well as increasing competition to its franchisees. All this expansion devalued Krispy Kreme brand's novelty, by making the once-specialty donuts ubiquitous, particularly as the newer sales outlets required pre-made donuts as opposed to the ones made fresh in factory stores, which alienated brand devotees.<ref name=\"cfo\" />\n\nBesides royalty payments from new stores, the parent company also enjoyed significant profits by requiring franchisees to purchase mix and doughnut-making equipment from the parent's Krispy Kreme Manufacturing and Distribution (KKM&D) division. KKM&D earned $152.7 million in 2003, which made up 31 percent of sales, with a reported operating margin of 20 percent or higher, but these mark-ups were largely at the expense of its franchisees. By comparison, rival chain Dunkin' Donuts generally avoids selling equipment or materials to its franchisees which \"keeps company and franchisee interests aligned\", as well as having a royalty stream based on same-store sales.<ref name=\"cfo\" />\n\nKrispy Kreme has been accused of [[channel stuffing]] by franchisees, whose stores reportedly \"received twice their regular shipments in the final weeks of a quarter so that headquarters could make its numbers\".<ref name=\"cfo\" /> The company was also dogged by questionable transactions and self-dealing accusations over the buybacks of franchisees, including those operated by company insiders.<ref name=\"businessweek\" /> A report released in August 2005 singled out then-CEO Scott Livengood and then-COO John W. Tate to blame for the accounting scandals although it did not find that the executives committed intentional fraud.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/11/business/11place.html |work=The New York Times |first=Melanie |last=Warner |title=Report Details Some Failures That Hurt Krispy Kreme |date=2005-08-11}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2009, the SEC issued a cease and desist order against Krispy Kreme for its actions inflating their revenues and engaging in illicit activities regarding the purchasing of its own stores to prop up revenues and setting up mechanisms to guarantee it beat earnings estimates by $0.01 which eventually resulted in Krispy Kreme reducing net income over 2 years of over $10.5 million.

The doughnut has 84 [[Joule|kJ]] (20 [[Food energy|kilocalories]] in most countries, or 20 [[Calorie]]s in the US) fewer than the original glazed (754 kJ vs. 837 kJ) and contains more fiber (2&nbsp;grams vs. 0.5&nbsp;grams). As of January 2008, the [[trans fat]] content of all Krispy Kreme doughnuts was reduced to 0.5 of a gram or less. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], in its guidelines, allows companies to round down to 0&nbsp;g in its [[nutrition facts label]] even if the food contains as much as 0.5 of a gram per serving.
