Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture.

Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]].

Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]].

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]].

On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s.

These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

Historically, they inhabited vast parts of it, as well as the western side of the [[island]] of [[Krk]] until 1875. However, due to several factors such as the [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]] of Istria during the [[socialist]] regime of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], many Istro-Romanians [[emigrated]] to other places, be they cities in [[Croatia]] like [[Pula]] and [[Rijeka]] or areas such as [[New York City]], [[Trieste]] or [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanians dwindled severely in number, being reduced to eight [[Human settlement|settlements]] on the Croatian side of Istria in which they do not represent the [[Ethnic majority|majority]].\n\nIt is known that the Istro-Romanians are actually not indigenous to Istria, since the differences between the [[Istro-Romanian language]] and the now [[Language death|extinct]] [[geographically]] close [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]] are notable. In addition, they count several similarities with the [[Transylvania]]n [[Romanians]] and [[Timok Vlachs]], suggesting that the Istro-Romanians originate from the current areas west of [[Romania]] or [[Serbia]]. Although it is not known exactly how and when, the Istro-Romanians settled in Istria, where they would remain for [[centuries]] until they began to suffer [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Even now, with several [[Voluntary association|associations]] and projects that aim to preserve their [[culture]] and with the support of both [[Croatian Government|Croatian]] and [[Romanian Government|Romanian]] [[government]]s, the Istro-Romanians are not officially recognized as a [[Minority languages of Croatia|national minority]].\n\nAlthough it has become widely popular and is now used almost exclusively, the term \"Istro-Romanian\" is a somewhat controversial [[scientific]] invention, which is not used by them to identify themselves. The Istro-Romanians prefer to use names derived from their native [[village]]s, which are [[Jesenovik]], [[Kostr\u010dani]], [[Letaj, Croatia|Letaj]], [[Nova Vas, Kr\u0161an|Nova Vas]], [[\u0160u\u0161njevica]], [[Zankovci]], the Brdo area and the isolated [[\u017dejane]]. Others also use \"[[Vlach]]\", but to refer to the entire Istro-Romanian population, the names ''rum\u00e2ri'' and ''rumeri'' are often employed. Their [[language]] is highly similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both being part of the [[Balkan Romance languages]] family alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] and [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]], all descending from [[Proto-Romanian]]. However, Romania regards these ethnic groups as part of a \"broad definition\" of what a Romanian is, which is debatable and does not have a widely accepted view.\n\nThe Istro-Romanian culture has [[Folk costume|costumes]], [[Folk dance|dances]] and [[Folk song|songs]] with many similarities to those of Romania. [[Literature]] in Istro-Romanian is small, with the first [[book]] published in 1905. Historically, they were [[peasant]]s and [[shepherd]]s, with many of them being [[poor]] and without having received [[education]] until the 20th century. Today, the Istro-Romanian language has little use in education, [[News media|media]] and [[religion]], with the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] imposition in these and other domains. They are so few that they have been described as \"the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]\". It is thought that if their situation does not change, the Istro-Romanians will disappear in the following decades.\n\n==Names==\n===Endonym===\n[[File:Gheorghe Asachi (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gheorghe Asachi]], the first person to use the name \"Istro-Romanian\"]]\nThe term \"Istro-Romanian\" is commonly used among [[researcher]]s and [[linguist]]s to identify this [[Balkan Romance languages|Balkan Romance people]] from the [[Istrian Peninsula]].

The communities south of the U\u010dka and \u017dejane have historically had very few contacts until the intervention of Romanian researchers, as they spoke Croatian at local [[fair]]s. Because of this, the feeling of ethnic and linguistic unity between both communities is weak.<ref name=\":15\" /> Currently, very few Istro-Romanians identify themselves as Romanian, and never with much enthusiasm. A large part of them affiliate with the [[Regions of Croatia|region]] in which they live, that is, Istria. This not only happens in the Istro-Romanians; approximately 25,000 people in Istria declare to be Istrian before any other [[nationality]], which is sometimes referred to as \"Istrianess\". Those Istro-Romanians who preferred to declare a national affiliation chose Croatian and a few Italian. Many Istro-Romanians think that the [[Croatian Government]] is not doing enough for the survival of their language and culture. They express a strong [[National pride|ethnic pride]] and their desire to pass their language to other [[generation]]s, although those in the villages south of the U\u010dka are more pessimistic about their future. There, the [[language shift]] to Croatian is more advanced than in \u017dejane, but the inhabitants are more protectionist regarding their culture. In \u017dejane, some Istro-Romanians still speak in Istro-Romanian with their grandchildren, and express less awareness about their extinction.<ref name=\":23\" /> Nowadays, the biggest goal of the Istro-Romanians is the full recognition by Croatia as an ethnic minority and a wider use of their language in education, newspapers, [[TV broadcasting]] and [[radio]], all of this with the support of the Croatian Government.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Istro-Romanian villages.png|thumb|250px|Villages populated by the Istro-Romanians nowadays]]\nThe territory where the Istro-Romanians live was once covered with [[forest]]s, [[pasture]]s and [[lake]]s, ideal for [[livestock]] or [[charcoal]] production.

All this caused a decrease in the number of Istro-Romanians, which have been reduced to only eight settlements today.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\nNow, there are two identifiable groups of Istro-Romanians.

Thus, \u017dejane, \u0160u\u0161njevica, Nova Vas, Jesenovik, Letaj, Kostr\u010dani, Zankovci and Brdo become ''Jei\u0103n'', ''Su\u0219\u0144\u00e9vi\u021b\u0119'', ''N\u00f3selo'' or ''N\u00f3solo'', ''Suc\u00f3dru'', ''Let\u00e5i'', ''Cost\u00e2r\u010dan'', ''Zankovci'' and ''B\u00e2rdo'' (''Brig'' for the hamlet). Other regions such as \u0106i\u0107arija or Istria are called ''Cicearia''<ref name=\":0\" /> and ''Istrie'', respectively.<ref name=\":32\" /> According to the memory of some, Istro-Romanian was also spoken in [[Gradinje, Cerovlje|Gradinje]] and [[Grobnik, Istria County|Grobnik]] and the hamlets Doli\u0161\u0107ina, Trkovci and Perasi until recently.<ref name=\":27\" /> All of these villages at the south of the U\u010dka constituted the Italian municipality of Valdarsa.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nDetailed information of an unspecified date reports that, of the 134 inhabitants of \u017dejane, 53 (39%) can speak Istro-Romanian.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the southern villages, the Istro-Romanians make up a bit more than a quarter of the population, with approximately 75 (27%) speakers out of 276 in 2016. Therefore, there are about 120 Istro-Romanians living in their villages. Both communities, although now connected with roads, live in different [[Administrative divisions of Croatia|Croatian administrative regions]]; the southern villages are located in the Istria County and \u017dejane, despite being geographically in Istria, is part of [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].<ref name=\":23\" /> However, the number of ethnic Istro-Romanians or people with Istro-Romanian ancestry in Istria could be as high as 1,500, even if they no longer speak the language and practice only some (or none) of their traditions.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, many Istro-Romanians abandoned their native villages. In fact, the population of the villages today are less than a fifth of what they were in 1945. Many of them moved to nearby cities and towns, such as [[Kr\u0161an]], [[Labin]], [[Matulji]], [[Opatija]], Pazin, [[Pula]] and Rijeka. It is estimated that a total of 450 Istro-Romanians live in Croatia outside their settlements. Others decided to emigrate to other parts of the world, especially to [[New York City]] and [[Western Australia]]. The Istro-Romanian community living outside Croatia is made up of around 500 people.<ref name=\":23\" /> It is estimated that the total of Istro-Romanians of \u017dejane who now live abroad is 195, four times larger than the population residing in \u017dejane. Although the exact number of the diaspora of the Istro-Romanians from the south of the U\u010dka is unknown, it is probably higher than that of \u017dejane since the emigration there was more potent and the population itself of the villages together was bigger than that of \u017dejane.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Folklore===\n====Dances and songs====\n[[File:Dormanfalva.jpg|thumb|Similar costume of a Romanian women in [[D\u0103rm\u0103ne\u0219ti]], in the Romanian part of [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]]]]\nIstro-Romanian [[art]] is characterized by the domination of [[dance]]s and songs.<ref name=\":16\" /> Istro-Romanian [[holiday]]s tend to be somewhat austere, but accompanied by traditional [[Folk instrument|musical instruments]] and [[Folk dance|dances]]. In one of these dances, called ''Columbaro'', the peasants of the villages spend hours holding each other's [[hand]]s in a closed circle, giving steps without order and with jumps without cadence. Dancers often form an arch with their hands through which a human chain passes underneath. According to Leca Morariu, this dance is similar to those of [[Bukovina]] (a part of which is in Romania). One of the favorite dances of the Istro-Romanians is the ''Kolo'', initially with a circular shape and then developing in ''skkocigori'', that is, with high jumps. The dancers hold their hands and form a circle, slowly spinning all together under the [[music]]. Another dance is literally called \"under the feet\", in which a man and a woman or two of each dance together while [[hugging]]. Researchers who have studied Istro-Romanian dances have highlighted their [[primitivism]].<ref name=\":31\">{{cite journal|url=https://revistatransilvania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14-Elena-Ramona-Potoroaca-Istro-Romanians\u2019-heritages-.-A-comparative-analysis.pdf|title=Tradi\u021bii istrorom\u00e2ne - trecut \u0219i prezent.

That is why some of them have classified them into the following categories: songs, elegant songs, [[satires]] and diverse creations. Traian Cantemir, a Romanian researcher, published in 1935 ''Motivele dispari\u021biei poeziei populare la istrorom\u00e2ni'' (\"Reasons for the disappearance of popular poetry of the Istro-Romanians\") in the magazine ''F\u0103t-Frumos'', expressing concern regarding the future of their [[poetry]]. Most of the time, the [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] of the [[poem]]s were accompanied by a song, becoming [[popular song]]s for [[travel]]s. Some foreign non-native travelers reported that their songs were like \"ancient poems\" and that \"a long exclamation or rather, a barbaric and prolonged cry precedes any verse\". The Istro-Romanian traveler could casually find a partner with whom he had a musical dialogue, keeping both entertained and with whom they practiced [[improvisation]]. Another author who investigated in depth the Istro-Romanian songs was the Romanian writer Petru Iroaie, identifying their similarities with those of [[Maramure\u0219]] and Bukovina and the main [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] of them. Italian and especially Croatian influence diminished the knowledge of these songs, being mostly maintained by the [[elderly]] during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, songs with some Croatian influences gradually began to circulate in the villages. Today, some young Istro-Romanians have some distrust or even fear of giving voice to those songs. In the Istro-Romanian language, as in other ones, the song is related to social realities, whereby the main subjects dealt with work in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]], [[love]], warfare and interethnic relations. Today, the Istro-Romanians cannot remember certain words of their language, and therefore some old [[lyrics]] and verses can no longer be read. This has led Cantemir to define them as \"fossils\".<ref name=\":31\" /> However, some Istro-Romanian songs have managed to prevail until today. Among them are ''Knd am tire'' (\"When [I asked] you\"), ''Mes-am o\u010da \u0161i kola'' (\"I went around\"), ''Oj ljepure nu \u017euka'' (\"Do not dance, rabbit\") and ''Fina feta'' (\"A nice girl\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nThe famous [[folk group]] \u017dejanski Zvon\u010dari (\u017dejane's Bell Ringers), founded by Mauro Dori\u010di\u0107<ref name=\":15\" /> in 1997, advocates the preservation of the old [[carnival]]esque Istro-Romanian traditions. It is made up of the [[zvon\u010dari]] (bell ringers), an exclusively male carnival dance group, and the \"Kntaduri\" ([[singers]]), an ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group. The association has also published new songs mainly in the Istro-Romanian dialect of \u017dejane, such as ''Tu ver fi ama'' (\"You will be mine\"), ''Pustu an \u017dejan'' (\"Carnival in \u017dejane\") and even an [[anthem]], ''\u017dejanska'', in both Croatian and Istro-Romanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vlaski-zejanski.com/upload_data/editor/files/Resources-Music_library-Zejanski_kntaduri-fin-eng.pdf|title=\u017dejanski Kntaduri (The \u017dejanan Singers)|first=Mauro|last=Dori\u010di\u0107|publisher=Preservation of the Vla\u0161ki and \u017dejanski Language|location=\u017dejane|year=2009}}</ref> On the day of the carnival, the zvon\u010dari ring their [[bell]]s from [[morning]] to [[evening]], going from house to house and receiving food like [[bacon]] or [[Egg as food|eggs]]. At [[night]], [[sandwich]]es made with the food received from the houses are distributed. On the day of the carnival there are also ''crabulele'', boys and girls between 10 and 20 years old with [[harmonic]]s and [[mask]]s, who go from house to house dancing and telling [[joke]]s. One of the children has a [[basket]] for the [[gift]]s and the rest sticks to defend against [[stranger]]s if necessary.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n====Costumes====\n[[File:Zejanski i halubajski zvoncari EM 300109.jpg|thumb|left|Costumes of the [[zvon\u010dari]] of \u017dejane during the [[Night of Museums]] at the [[Ethnographic Museum, Zagreb|Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb]]]]\nThe inhabitants of \u017dejane wore unique [[hat]]s that \"scared\" the nearby populations. These were put so that the back of the hat covered the [[face]], so that they could [[Theft|steal]] to those who had [[money]], for reasons that researchers have described as \"well grounded\". Another hat worn in \u017dejane was the ''comaracu'', with several colored [[rope]]s. The lower rope was made of [[velvet]] and the rest of [[silk]]. In the elderly, these ropes were dark, and in the [[youth]], colorful and bright (dominating [[blue]], [[yellow]], [[red]] and [[green]]). The hats of the latter were decorated with [[peacock feather]]s and [[flower bouquet]]s. These hats were similar to the ones worn between the [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u0219]] and [[T\u00e2rnava]] rivers in Transylvania. The [[costume]]s of men had a tight [[shirt]] with long, low and narrow [[suspenders]], as well as ''[[Opanak|opinci]]'' (traditional [[shoe]]s, similar to those of the Romanians). On the shirt, they wore a [[waistcoat]] called ''crujat''. In [[winter]], they wore a [[cape]] called ''halea'', and on the [[neck]] they had a [[scarf]] called ''fa\u0219\u0103''. During the 18th century, women wore a [[headscarf]] with their [[hair]] [[Braid (hairstyle)|braided]]. In the 19th century they used a ''tulpan''. The white shirt reached to the [[knees]] and was covered by a colorful [[dress]] called ''barhan''. They also had ''opinci''. According to Burada, their [[leg]]s were covered by [[sock]]s called ''bicivele'' and with [[garter]]s called ''podvezi''. Today's Istro-Romanians have difficulty describing the [[traditional costume]]s of their ancestors and few know the names of each [[clothes]].<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThese traditional costumes are still preserved in \u017dejane, but only during the carnival or artistic events. However, the number of owners is very low, most of them being [[parent]]s or [[grandparent]]s, who pass them to the youth as a special symbol of the Istro-Romanian identity. Today's women's costumes are made up of a ''fa\u021bo'' (red scarf), an ''opleici'' (white shirt with an [[embroidery]] at the base of the neck), a ''pocirneka'' (black dress with a red [[ribbon]] and sleeveless) and a ''firtuhu'' (an [[apron]] put on the dress). Under the dress there is a white and tight [[skirt]], to give a special look to the costume. At the [[waist]], the dress is connected with the ''coani\u021ba'' (the widest \"[[Belt (clothing)|belt]]\") and the ''tisuta'' (the thinnest \"belt\"), both with different colors. The legs, covered with the ''bicivi'', wear black ''postole'' as [[footwear]]. Now, men wear a shirt or a black [[jacket]]. The [[pants]], which can be white or black, are called ''braghesi''. On the [[head]] they wear a black hat, and on the [[feet]], ''postole'', like women.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe costume of the zvon\u010dari consists of a typical [[sailor shirt]] with two ''fa\u021bole'' (white [[batiste]]s). On the [[back]] is a [[sheepskin]] garment to which three large bells are attached. A ''kumaroak'' is carried on the head, in which hundreds of colorful strips that extend to the person's back are connected. Above the strips, there are two [[rose]]s that symbolize the [[sun]]. The pants and footwear are not really different from those of the traditional costume.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Istro-Romanian language}}\n[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Position of the Romance languages in [[Europe]], with Istro-Romanian and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] marked in Istria]]\nIstro-Romanians speak the Istro-Romanian language (sometimes abbreviated as IR), part of the Balkan Romance languages spoken exclusively natively in Istria, Croatia. They have been described as the smallest [[ethnolinguistic group]] in [[Europe]]. Their language is classified by the [[UNESCO]] as a \"seriously endangered language\" because of the small number of fluent speakers the language has, education in Istro-Romanian is limited and the language is not usually used in many domains and the majority of younger speakers are adults, among others. Vrzi\u0107's [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] project fulfills some of these points, however.<ref name=\":29\" /> According to several mostly Romanian researchers,<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":31\" /> the Istro-Romanian language is one of the four traditional and historical [[dialect]]s of Romanian, alongside [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]] and Daco-Romanian (linguistic name for the Romanian from Romania and its surroundings), all with a common ancestor, [[Proto-Romanian]].<ref name=\":29\" /> However, Istro-Romanian can also be considered a language separated from Romanian by others, so there is no widely accepted view.<ref name=\":16\" /> Anyway, it is considered the [[daughter language]] (descendant) of Daco-Romanian, both being closer to each other than Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are.<ref name=\":29\" /> Nevertheless, Istro-Romanian is strongly influenced by Croatian, with it affecting its [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and with many linguistic loans, including [[function word]]s. This has led some authors to describe it as a \"[[mixed language]]\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Istro-Romanian consists of two main variants, a northern one (in \u017dejane) and a southern one (in the villages south of the U\u010dka). For example, for the [[oblique case]], the variety of \u017dejane (\"Zejanski\") preserves synthetic marking, while the southern variety (\"Vlaski\") uses only [[preposition]]al marking, but neither of them marks the [[accusative case]] (e.g. \"I can see Lara\" would be \"po\u010d ved\u0119 Lara\", literally \"can see Lara\"). Another difference is that in Zejanski, generally [[Masculine gender|masculine]] nouns of Slavic origin mark the [[vocative case]] with \"-e\", while those of Latin origin with \"-(u)le\". In Vlaski, some nouns are marked with \"-e\" and some \"-u\".<ref name=\":29\" /> But although Istro-Romanian has two main dialects, each village has its own speech, differing slightly among the southern villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HwyAAAAIAAJ|title=Enciclopedia limbilor romanice|first=Mioara|last=Avram|editor-first=Marius|editor-last=Sala|publisher=Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103|location=Bucharest|p=335|year=1989|language=ro|isbn=9789732900437}}</ref> The dialect of Krk, called by Croatian researchers as ''kr\u010dkorumunjski'' (literally \"Krko-Romanian\"), has been little studied and knowledge of it is minimal. The only texts known are [[Hail Mary]] and The [[Lord's Prayer]]. Even so, it is known that \"Krko-Romanian\" was an Istro-Romanian dialect as it had its characteristic rhotacism, as can be seen in Fint\u0209ra and ''\u0161piri\u0161\u00f4r''.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nThere has never been a consensus on what [[writing system]] should be used for the [[Istro-Romanian alphabet]], so Croatian and Romanian researchers have been recording and transcribing texts using different systems, with [[Croatian orthography|Croatian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]] or mixed orthographic elements. Vrzi\u0107 has proposed the idea of unifying the writing system, which has been implemented on her website and is based on Croatian [[spelling]]. These changes may vary, for example, the word \"when\", to ''k\u00e2nd'' (Croatian-based), ''c\u0103nd'' (Romanian-based) and ''c\u00e2nd'' (mixed).<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nHowever, Istro-Romanian is not the only language spoken by the Istro-Romanians. In fact, they represent a [[diglossic]] community (that is, they use more than one language), with no [[monolingual]] speakers of Istro-Romanian remaining. They usually also use the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Croatian and the elderly who attended to Italian schools, Italian or Istro-Venetian (the Istrian dialect of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]). Generally, the youth have no knowledge or understanding of the language, and prefer to use Croatian. Those Istro-Romanians who left the villages and migrated to the cities often use Croatian as the [[family]] language. The diaspora does not usually have knowledge of the language, result of intermarriages.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://istro-romanian.com/history/1995_orbanic-status.htm|title=Status attuale delle comunit\u00e0 istroromene|first=Sr\u0111a|last=Orbani\u0107|journal=Annales.

These are built in [[stone]], with double walls, one or two [[floor]]s and are covered with [[reed mace]] or burnt [[clay]]. Inside this \"carp\", there is a large [[chimney]] with a [[column]] above where \"a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] that receives the [[smoke]] and takes it to the [[oven]]\" is placed. Near the chimney is the ''paleta'' or ''lop\u0103ri\u021ba'', a long [[metal]] \"[[shovel]]\" or \"pole\" with which the [[wood]] is moved or removed. In the center of the vault above the chimney there is usually a large [[chain]] called ''catena'' where the ''cadera'' (a [[cauldron]]) is attached. In it, water is boiled for [[cooking]] and ''[[polenta]]'' ([[m\u0103m\u0103liga]]). According to Burada, [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and [[cutlery]] were hung around the chimney.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe \"carp\" that covers the house, bigger than the Romanian ones in Transylvania, serves as a refuge for people and also for [[animal]]s such as [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and sometimes, goats. To the left of the carp there is a [[room]] without chimney, with the door with the other room always open in winter to warm it. In this room there are several objects that are used only at special moments of the life of the owners. There is a ''mis\u0103'' ([[Table (furniture)|table]]), ''scanie'' ([[chair]]s) and a ''scriniu'' ([[closet]]), and on the boards over the [[ceiling]], several portions of [[food]] such as cheese, bacon and pork legs, where \"they [[Smoking (cooking)|smoke]] very well, as if they were in the vault of the chimney\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThe [[sheets]] are of great importance among Istro-Romanian women. These can be in square stone [[Structural support|supports]] or in wooden [[bed]]s. In these beds there can be sacks of [[straw]] or [[maize]] on which there were [[pillow]]s at their ends, some of them stuffed with straw and maize as well and others with [[goose]] [[feather]]s or [[horsehair]]. With the exception of the shirts and headscarfs that cover women's heads, every [[textile]] products used at home are usually made of [[wool]] and worked at home.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nThose Istro-Romanians with [[social status]] or numerous families may have another room. Their houses have retained much of the [[architectural]] features of the past, and therefore have not changed much over time.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\n===Literature and proverbs===\n[[File:Title page Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie 1905.png|thumb|[[Title page]] of ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'']]\n[[Literature]] written in the Istro-Romanian language is scarce and quite recent. The first book written in this language, ''Calindaru lu rumeri din Istrie'',<ref name=\":8\" /> was barely published in 1905. Its two authors were Glavina, an Istro-Romanian who always advocated the education of his people,<ref name=\":20\" /> and Diculescu.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this book, they gather words, [[proverb]]s and stories of the Istro-Romanians. Glavina would publish more works later, such as ''I romeni dell'Istria'' (The Romanians of Istria) and ''L'educazione nazionale'' (The national education) in the early 1920s. However, these texts, although about the Istro-Romanians, are in the Italian language. After his death, his wife Fiorella Zagabria published ''Promemoria e lettere'', a [[posthumous work]] in which Glavina's last texts are collected. The \"Istro-Romanian [[hymn]]\", showed below, is located there.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Imnul istro-romanilor (Romanian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Inno istrorumeno (Italian)'''<ref name=\":19\" />||'''Istro-Romanian hymn (English)'''<ref name=\":19\" />\n|-\n||\nRoma, Roma e mama noastr\u0103<br>noi romani r\u0103m\u00e2nem<br>Rom\u00e2nia e sora noastr\u0103<br>tot un s\u00e2nge avem.\n\nNu suntem singuri pe lume<br>\u0219i ne-avem fra\u021bi<br>italiani cu mare nume<br>m\u00e2na cu noi da\u021bi.\n\nCa sa fim frate \u0219i sor\u0103<br>cum a dat Dumnezeu<br>sa tr\u0103im p\u00e2n\u0103 la moarte<br>eu \u0219i tu \u0219i tu \u0219i eu.\n||\nRoma Roma \u00e8 la nostra madre<br>noi rimaniamo romani<br>la Romenia \u00e8 la nostra sorella<br>abbiamo tutti un sangue.\n\nNon siamo soli al mondo<br>se abbiamo fratelli<br>gli Italiani dal nome illustre<br>ci hanno dato una mano.\n\nSiamo fratelli e sorelle<br>come l'ha stabilito il Signore<br>cos\u00ec lo sosterremo fino alla morte<br>lo con te e tu con me.\n||\nRome, Rome is our mother<br>we remain Roman<br>Romania is our sister<br>we all have one blood.\n\nWe are not alone in the world<br>and we have each other as brothers<br>Italians of great name<br>you give your hands with us.\n\nSo we are brothers and sisters<br>as God has established<br>may we live to death<br>me and you and you and me.\n|}\n\nThe second book in Istro-Romanian, ''Lu frati no\u0219tri: libru lu rumeri din Istrie'', was published in 1928. Its author was a Romanian, Alexandru Leca Morariu, who made a trip to Istria in 1927 and another one in 1928 to study the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":32\" /> The first Istro-Romanian newspaper, ''Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer'', has been publishing cult literature, such as the poems of the brothers from Nova Vas Gabriela and Gabriel Vretenar of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://istro-romanian.com/literature/vretenar_poetry.htm|title=Poesie di Gabriela e Gabriel Vretenar|newspaper=Scrisoare c\u0103tre fr\u00e5\u021b rumer|year=1997|language=it}}</ref> In 2011, the Istro-Romanian Antonio Dianich publishes ''Vocabolario istroromeno\u2011italiano.

Today, they know less than before. Some of the best known proverbs are ''nu ie c\u00e5rne far de ose'' (\"there is no [[meat]] without [[bone]]s\"), ''lu Domnu \u0219i lu Dr\u00eecu nu se pote sluji o vot\u0119'' (\"you cannot serve [[God]] and the [[Devil]] at the same\ntime\"), ''mora bure m\u00e5cire \u0219i bov\u00e5n'' (\"the good [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] can [even] grind [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]\"), ''din cala lu omu bet \u0219i Domnu se d\u00e5ie la o bande'' (\"even God avoids the [[drunk]]\") and ''c\u00e5sta lume f\u0103cuta ie cu sc\u00e5le: uri mergu \u0103n sus, \u00e5l'\u021bi \u0103n jos'' (\"the world is made of [[stairs]]: some go up, others down\").<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n===Occupations===\n[[File:Postavljanje oglarske kope leta 1931.jpg|thumb|left|Pile of wood for making charcoal, similar to the Istro-Romanian ones, in 1931, Slovenia]]\nTraditionally and historically, the Istro-Romanians were shepherds, an occupation that would disappear with the centuries. They carried their [[sheep]] dressed in wool suits, a hat and ''opinci'' with [[knot]]s around the feet. They also had a [[walking stick]] [[Carving|carved]] with things of [[daily life]] that were sung to pass the time faster. The sheep were taken to pastures in which they would remain a month, time in which a small shepherd [[hut]] of wood was built. Inside it were sheepherding [[tool]]s such as a cauldron for ''[[ca\u0219]]'' (a type of cheese), a kind of [[container]] of dry soil where food was eaten and [[spoon]]s, the ''kikara'' (a [[cup]]), where fresh ''ca\u0219'' was placed during a day, and the [[bucket]] with which the sheep were [[Milking|milked]], among others. The process of making ''ca\u0219'' of the Istro-Romanians is the same as in Romania.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, the economy and [[wealth]] of the Istro-Romanians has weakened severely. Their [[wine]] [[crop]]s dried up, and agriculture is no longer as productive as before. They tried to replace the dried [[grapevine]]s with American ones, which became increasingly difficult for them. [[Drought]]s are another problem. The situation in livestock is no different. They never practiced [[animal breeding]] much. \"The [[horse]]s can't stand. In \u0160u\u0161njevica there are only three horses. Among the [[bird]]s there are only chickens. Sheepherding is weak. I have barely been able to find cheese for sale in \u017dejane. There are few sheep, and no goats\".<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nA characteristic of the inhabitants of \u017dejane was the production of charcoal, taking place in the mountains and then selling them in mostly Rijeka or Opatija. To produce it, once the wood (always [[beech]]) was collected, the Istro-Romanians stayed in a [[haystack]] called ''gljevaricsa'', two to three meters high and six to seven meters wide. Then, the wood was placed in the middle surrounded by straw and dry wood so that the [[fire]] could extend when it was lighted. Once produced, the charcoal was taken to the cities in order to market them.<ref name=\":31\" />  Specially practiced by men was cultivation in \u0160u\u0161njevica of culinary sage, \"undertaking a great business\". Burada is, however, the only one to present this occupation. Many of them worked in other places outside the villages. Women, on the other hand, were generally [[Housewife|housewives]], although they could also be ''furlani'', a kind of itinerant weavers.<ref name=\":31\" /> Other Istro-Romanians became [[miner]]s or sailors.<ref name=\":15\" /> From the 20th century onwards, the Istro-Romanians' [[needs]] and occupations change due to the modernization of the [[society]] in which they live. Some choose to go to the cities and others stay.<ref name=\":31\" />\n\nCurrently, the Istro-Romanians in \u017dejane are mainly engaged in agriculture and wood exploitation; very few continue with sheepherding. A good part of the men are workers in nearby cities. In the southern villages, agriculture is the largest source of [[income]]. There are still people cultivating grapevines in Brdo. Material conditions are relatively better in \u017dejane than in the southern villages, and therefore it has a better quality of life.<ref name=\":0\" /> The production of charcoal is no longer very active, and is generally practiced for [[tourist]]s.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Cefal\u00f9 Pantocrator retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]] [[mosaic]] in the [[Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]\nThe Istro-Romanians are [[Christians]], being the only Balkan Romance people belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=\":15\" /> Historically, the [[Christian Church|church]] has been the largest point of exposure for the Istro-Romanians to Croatian assimilation. Currently, it does not support the Istro-Romanian cause, with all services being given in Croatian.<ref name=\":23\" /> This has been the case since the second half of the 19th century. In fact, it is recorded that Croatian priests attracted mayors and other persons through [[corruption]] to act as they liked, disfavoring the Istro-Romanians.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nPrior to this, the Austrian Empire allowed the [[ordination]] of priests among the Istro-Romanians (such as Micetici, born in Brdo), with services given in Istro-Romanian. Nowadays, it has been proposed that the [[Catholic Church in Romania]] could delegate three or four Romanian-speaking priests to the villages.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nExamples of religious terms in Istro-Romanian are ''bes\u0119reca'' (\"church\"), ''catolica'' (\"Catholic\"), ''Domnedzeu'' (\"God\"), ''Isus'' (\"[[Jesus]]\") and ''sv\u00e2nt\u0103'' (\"holy\").<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nIt is possible that the Istro-Romanians were originally [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. In 1861, the Italian linguist [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] stated that Jesenovik's church was Orthodox before becoming a Catholic one.<ref name=\":30\" />\n\n==Notable figures==\n*[[Branko \u010crnac Tusta]] (family from unspecified location at \u0106i\u0107arija), singer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.muzika.hr/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta/|title=Ja sje\u0107am se \u2013 Branko \u010crnac Tusta|date=14 October 2014|publisher=Muzika.hr|accessdate=21 January 2020|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004329/http://www.muzika.hr/clanak/48303/komentari/ja-sjecam-se-branko-crnac-tusta.aspx|archivedate=23 March 2015|language=hr}}</ref>\n*Alberto Cvecich (Nova Vas), priest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.editfiume.com/archivio/lavoce/2007/070224/esuli.htm|title=\u00c8 scomparso a Pisa don Alberto Cvecich|first=Roberto|last=Palisca|newspaper=[[La Voce del Popolo]]|date=24 February 2007|language=it}}</ref>\n*Antonio Dianich (father from \u0160u\u0161njevica, mother from Kostr\u010dani),<ref name=\":25\">{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33038322|title=Societas et universitas.

{"title_page": "Erik Morse", "text_new": "{{update|date=February 2011}}\n'''Erik Morse''' (or '''Eric Morse''') (born November 1979), is an [[United States|American]] underground author, rock writer and journalist.\nMorse was born and grew up in the small town of Conroe, [[Texas]] near a farm where [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]] once lived in the 1940s.  Despite a tumultuous teenage life in a [[Houston]] private school where [[juvenile crime]] ultimately led him to a stint in [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], Morse went on to graduate from [[New York University]] with a degree in film and philosophy.\n\nAt the same time, Morse also met and worked extensively with [[New York City]] downtown writers and journalists - among them, punk laureate and [[Andy Warhol]] associate [[Victor Bockris]], [[International Times]]' founder and [[Beatles']] biographer [[Barry Miles]] and [[Please Kill Me]] ''bon vivant'' [[Legs McNeil]].  After a chance meeting with [[Spacemen 3]] founder and [[avant-garde]] musician, Sonic Boom (A.K.A. [[Peter Kember]]) in an [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] club in 2001, Morse began penning a lengthy and exhausting biography of the band during his final year of college.  The completed text, known alternatively as [[Spacemen 3 and the Birth of Spiritualized]] or [[Dreamweapon]] \u2013 which detailed the two decade history of the legendary narcotic outfit \u2013 was published by [[Omnibus Press]] UK in 2004 and in the US in 2005.  The book was featured in US and UK magazines [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]], [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]], [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], Harp, and Magnet as well as [[BBC]] Radio, and critically praised by [[Simon Reynolds]], [[Thurston Moore]], [[Dennis Cooper]] and [[Christian Fennesz]].  Morse has also written for various magazines and journals throughout the US and Europe, with features in [[Filmmaker Magazine]], ''[[Frieze (magazine)]]'', [[Interview Magazine]], [[Arthur Magazine]], [[Bomb Magazine]], [[Bookforum]] and [[Semiotext(e)]]'s [[Animal Shelter]].  He is currently a contributing writer for the [[San Francisco Bay Guardian]].\n\nErik Morse has collaborated with [[Southern rock]] legend, [[filmmaker]] and [[photographer]] [[Tav Falco]] on a dual, 450-page encyclopedic history and [[psychogeography]] of the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The two volumes together are entitled ''Mondo Memphis''.

Burroughs]] once lived in the 1940s.  Despite a tumultuous teenage life in a [[Houston]] private school where [[juvenile crime]] ultimately led him to a stint in [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], Morse went on to graduate from [[New York University]] with a degree in film and philosophy.\n\nAt the same time, Morse also met and worked extensively with [[New York City]] downtown writers and journalists - among them, punk laureate and [[Andy Warhol]] associate [[Victor Bockris]], [[International Times]]' founder and [[Beatles']] biographer [[Barry Miles]] and [[Please Kill Me]] ''bon vivant'' [[Legs McNeil]].  After a chance meeting with [[Spacemen 3]] founder and [[avant-garde]] musician, Sonic Boom (A.K.A. [[Peter Kember]]) in an [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] club in 2001, Morse began penning a lengthy and exhausting biography of the band during his final year of college.  The completed text, known alternatively as [[Spacemen 3 and the Birth of Spiritualized]] or [[Dreamweapon]] \u2013 which detailed the two decade history of the legendary narcotic outfit \u2013 was published by [[Omnibus Press]] UK in 2004 and in the US in 2005.  The book was featured in US and UK magazines [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]], [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]], [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], Harp, and Magnet as well as [[BBC]] Radio, and critically praised by [[Simon Reynolds]], [[Thurston Moore]], [[Dennis Cooper]] and [[Christian Fennesz]].  Morse has also written for various magazines and journals throughout the US and Europe, with features in [[Filmmaker Magazine]], ''[[Frieze (magazine)]]'', [[Interview Magazine]], [[Arthur Magazine]], [[Bomb Magazine]], [[Bookforum]] and [[Semiotext(e)]]'s [[Animal Shelter]].  He is currently a contributing writer for the [[San Francisco Bay Guardian]].\n\nErik Morse has collaborated with [[Southern rock]] legend, [[filmmaker]] and [[photographer]] [[Tav Falco]] on a dual, 450-page encyclopedic history and [[psychogeography]] of the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The two volumes together are entitled ''Mondo Memphis''. Falco's book is a study of Memphis beginning with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] up to more recent autobiographical accounts in the city. Erik Morse's roman noir follows a West Coast graduate student and his encounters with a Memphis [[secret society]]. The volumes are published by [[Creation Books]], and the limited edition hardcover was released in July 2011.<ref>Creation Books (May 2011) \"MONDO MEMPHIS : TAV FALCO / ERIK MORSE\" {{cite web|url=http://www.creationbooks.com/creation-titles/MONDOMEMPHIS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315151034/http://www.creationbooks.com/creation-titles/MONDOMEMPHIS.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/music/2007/09/thats_saint_stephen_morrissey.html Morse's Feature on Morrissey for SFBG]\n*[http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/music/2007/10/thirty_years_of_sister_lovers.html Morse's Feature on Big Star and Alex Chilton for SFBG]\n*[http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/inland-empire/ Interview with 3:AM (2012)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morse, Erik}}\n[[Category:Writers from Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male writers]]\n[[Category:1979 births]]\n[[Category:New York University alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Morse"}

The university's history dates back to the emergence of dental schools in Russia in the [[19th century in Russia|19th century]].\n\n= History =\n== Establishment ==\nThe history of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) dates back to the 19th century, when the first dental school was opened in [[Moscow]] by I.M. Kovarsky. Later, when the [[Soviet-Russia|Soviets came to power in Russia]], it was turned into the House of Soviet Dentistry, and was called upon to tackle a tremendous task of organizing dental health services for the population. The main purpose of MSUMD has always been to train highly qualified medical professionals. Several prominent Russian health care figures who had played a prominent role in establishing the university made a point of including dentistry in the curriculum of the medical school, including [[N.A. Semashko]], [[P.G. Dauge]], [[M.\u0412. Yankovsky]] and [[A.I. Yevdokimov]].\n\n== Early Soviet years==\n\nIn February 1920, when the Kovarsky dental school went under the jurisdiction of Narkomzdrav ([[People's Commissariat of Health|the People's Commissariat of Health]]), the Kovarsky school was transformed into a dental research center by the decision of Narkomzdrav's dental health division in order to bring together all dental care units that existed at the time in different parts of Moscow \u2014 a demonstration dispensary, a chemical laboratory, and the Kovarsky institution itself. The center was named the House of Soviet Dentistry (HSD) and among its main purposes were the retraining of former dentists into oral care consultants, and the preparation of secondary dental personnel, such as dental mechanics, filling and prosthetic specialists, and chair side assistants. \n\nFirst renamed in December, 1920, the HSD's official opening took place two years later in April 1922, when again it was given a different name. This time it was the State Institute of Dentistry (SID), which was to be headed by M.\u0412. Yankovsky, who directed his staff in an in-depth study of Dentistry and [[Odontology]] before anything else; the two major problems to be solved were [[tooth decay]] and [[periodontal disease]]. Among those who joined efforts in the study of these problems were scientists such as professors Ya.S. Utshtem, M.S. Nemenov, M.\u041e. Kovarsky, N.M.  Vilnik, and A.I. Yevdokimov, who replaced M.\u0412. Yankovsky at the post after his death in January 1923. A.I. Yevdokimov made large contributions of his own in the SID's development and that earned him the titles of [[Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation]], a corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR and of [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]. Another new name, that of the State Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SISO) was given in April 1927 by decree of the [[Sovnarkom]] (the Soviet government). The SISO was to continue the job of training dentists through a specially organized refresher course for dental professionals and a dental specialization course for general medicine faculties. This helped to streamline the public dental health care as well as carry on with scientific research in the fields of dental and oral pathology and therapy, [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[orthodontics]], and [[prosthodontics]].\n\nIn 1932, the SISO was renamed yet again, this time to the State Research Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SRISO) and from then on it was concerned mostly with scientific research problems. There were no educational departments in it at the time, those having been replaced by newly formed divisions for pathological [[physiology]], morphology, [[surgery]] and social dentistry instead, to which a steel prosthetics laboratory was added. Another, central, laboratory for prosthetics research was set up a year later in 1933 to manufacture steel dentures on a large scale.\n\n== Years as Moscow Stomatological Institute ==\n\nThe Moscow Stomatological Institute (MSI) as a higher dental school was established under the Narkomzdrav's order dated June 9, 1935, as a subdivision within the SRISO's framework. Both institutions were housed in one building, sharing administration, finances and facilities. Thus, the MSI became the only institution in the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (RSFSR) that was to conduct scientific research in dentistry, translate the results obtained into everyday dental care practices and train dental professionals as well. Since 1935 a whole number of departments were being added to the institute those of normal anatomy, biology, general chemistry, histology, embryology, and, finally, in 1937 the departments of oral therapy, oral surgery and prosthodontics.\n\nIn line with the resolution of the RSFSR Narkomzdrav of September 1, 1939, the SRISO and MSI were united to become the Moscow State Stomatology Institute (MSSI) with associate professor D. S. Dyshlis as Director. That year witnessed the first batch of 79 graduates trained by the new institution. By the time World War II broke out, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute included 25 departments involved in the studies of dental caries, [[periodontitis]], oral mucous membrane lesions, and maxillofacial injuries.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the MSSI's 1941 graduates were called up to serve in the Red Army or Navy. Among the graduates were V.I. Zausaev who operated on an open heart in a field hospital and who later became a professor and a department head, G.M. Ivaschenko who joined the Army as Chief Dentist, A.I. Doimkov and V.F. Rudko who also gained professorship after the war. To provide the front with dentists, the MSSI put up a special crash course in October, 1941. The MSSI's director, associate professor D.S. Dyshlis, was sent to Izhevsk to make all the necessary arrangements for evacuating the institute to that town, but then the idea was given up. Instead, the MSSI premises in Dolgorukovskaya Street were used to lay out a 50-bed maxillofacial hospital staffed with the institute's polyclinical personnel and the Dentistry department undergraduates. Because of this, over 85% of soldiers with maxillofacial wounds were able to return to the front unscathed. On October 1, 1943, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute opened its doors to students again and about a year later, in February, 1944, A.I.  Yevdokimov was appointed its director.\n\n== After [[World War II]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw]] ==\n\nAfter the war the training of dental care professionals became vital again. So on October 15, 1949, by decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, former dental schools were reorganized into general medicine and dentistry institutes with a 5-year course of studies. The Moscow State Stomatology Institute was again renamed to become the Moscow Medical Stomatology Institute (MMSI), which became famous as the country's research and consulting center on all dentistry-related issues.\n\nIn 1950, associate professor G.N. Beletskiy, a prominent public health worker, was appointed as MMSI director Under his leadership, a student enrollment to the institution went up significantly, the existing clinical medicine facilities were enlarged and new teaching hospitals went under construction, the standards of training research and teaching staff also having much improved. Moreover, two more faculties were launched, part-time and correspondence ones.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, the institute was headed by Prof A.I. Doimkov. For many years professor he acted as Chief Dentist of the USSR Ministry of Health administration division No 4 that was in charge of providing dental services to members of the Soviet government and top officials from other countries.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, the post of Rector of the MMSI was held by Professor S.I. Babichev, head of the institute's Surgical Disease department. It was he who initiated the idea of incorporating a General Medicine Faculty into the MMSI. On the basis of the Eye Disease department led by Prof S.N. Fyodorov an ophthalmologic research laboratory was created in 1967. The research staff under Prof S.N. Fyodorv looked into a wide range of scientific and practical problems of eye disorders and that, having eventually crowned with success, allowed him to turn the laboratory into what is now known internationally as the Microsurgery of the Eye scientific research institute.\n\n== [[Brezhnev era|Brezhnev years]] and [[Perestroika]] ==\n\nDuring the period of time from 1968 to 1974 when the institute was headed by Prof A.Z. Belousov, the proposal of setting up a general medicine faculty won his support and was realized in 1968. The emergence of the new faculty that was to cater for the need in medical professionals by the city of Moscow and its surroundings called for employment of more teaching staff for a number of the existing departments (those of Foreign Languages, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, Histology, Physics and General Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology and others) as well as for putting up new courses and departments. These were launched a year later, staffed with qualified specialists and office workers that helped improve the work of the Faculty's administration and dean's offices. That same year, the MMSI opened an advanced training faculty for medical professionals with departments for dental and general practitioners which was followed by opening in 1975 of a faculty for advanced training of teaching staff.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Professor \u041a.M. Lakin, corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], headed the institution. He proved very successful with his studies of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disease prevention and treatment, the results of which have been widely applied in medical practice. Working in this field he virtually laid the foundation of the hemostasis pharmacology school. His time at the MMSI is marked by putting into operation a Clinical Dentistry Center in Moscow in 1976. It was designed to cater for 2 000 out-patients and 50 in-patients a day and housed a number of the Institute's dental teaching hospital departments.\n\n== In [[Russian federation|modern Russia]] ==\n\nThe decades that followed (1982 to 2002) saw Professor Ye.I. Sokolov as the Rector. As head of the Internal Disease department, he became known for his research into the problems of ischemic heart disease, correction of hemostasis disturbances, and clinical psychophysiology, which brought him success and were immediately put to medical use. Under Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's leadership, the Dentistry faculty premises were greatly enlarged and new departments added to both Dentistry and General Medicine faculties, as well as output of graduates increased. In 1986 \u0430 part-time faculty for dental students was opened, in 1995 - that for post-graduate students, and, in 1998, a secondary medical education faculty was launched to train dental mechanics. Two more to come were a refresher course for dental specialists and the Clinical Psychology faculty, in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Towards the end of the decade, another change of name was in store for the Institution, this time by the orders of the Ministries for General and Vocational Education and that for Public Health of the Russian Federation (RF) dated June 10, 1999. These granted the MMSI a university status with a full name from then on of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) under the RF Ministry of Public Health.\n\n= Rector of the University =\n\nDuring the five years after Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's resignation in 2002 the University was led by Professor N.D. Yushchuk, a RAS and RAMS academician, RF Honored Scientist, government prize winner, head of the University's Infectious Disease and Epidemiology department. The department's staff is known to take an active part in the work of the Moscow and All-Russia scientific societies of infectionists, microbiologists, epidemiologists and parasitologists, many being members on those societies' boards. This helped to spread new ideas within the country's medical community. The rector paid great attention to the introduction of latest techniques of teaching and assessment of higher school and post-graduate students into the university's practice taking due account of latest pedagogy and medical psychology techniques. Professor N.D. Yuschuk was an active participant in the development of a new effective test control system aimed at better assessment of students' progress. The system was first tried at the time of state assessment of MSMDU students upon graduation and later approved for use by other medical colleges in Russia. It was under Prof N.D. Yuschuk that a scheme was developed, and is now successfully used, for a continuous medical education when a higher medical is to be followed by postgraduate courses (internship, residency, specialization, retraining, and refresher). As to the university's new educational facilities that sprang into being in 2002, they include the faculty of Health Economics and Management (2004), the Moscow Region faculty (2005), and that of Penitentiary Medicine (2006).\n\nOn May 15, 2007, Professor O.O. Yanushevich, head of the MSMDU Periodontology and Geriatric Dentistry department, was elected rector in a ballot by a university staff meeting that was also unanimous in voting for the former rector, academician N.D. Yuschuk, as the University President.\n\nHimself a graduate of the MSUMD, the Rector elected worked for a number of years at the University's Hospital Oral Therapy Department. Today, he has over 50 scientific papers on topical periodontal problems to his credit.\n\n= Notable faculty =\n* Oleg Yanushevich, DDM - rector of MSUMD, professor, honored doctor of Russia.\n* [[Anatoly Sharpenak]] (1895 - 1969) - scholar and biochemist, Professor. In 1939, he founded the Department of Biological Chemistry, and was the head of the department until 1969.

The university's history dates back to the emergence of dental schools in Russia in the [[19th century in Russia|19th century]].\n\n= History =\n== Establishment ==\nThe history of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) dates back to the 19th century, when the first dental school was opened in [[Moscow]] by I.M. Kovarsky. Later, when the [[Soviet-Russia|Soviets came to power in Russia]], it was turned into the House of Soviet Dentistry, and was called upon to tackle a tremendous task of organizing dental health services for the population. The main purpose of MSUMD has always been to train highly qualified medical professionals. Several prominent Russian health care figures who had played a prominent role in establishing the university made a point of including dentistry in the curriculum of the medical school, including [[N.A. Semashko]], [[P.G. Dauge]], [[M.\u0412. Yankovsky]] and [[A.I. Yevdokimov]].\n\n== Early Soviet years==\n\nIn February 1920, when the Kovarsky dental school went under the jurisdiction of Narkomzdrav ([[People's Commissariat of Health|the People's Commissariat of Health]]), the Kovarsky school was transformed into a dental research center by the decision of Narkomzdrav's dental health division in order to bring together all dental care units that existed at the time in different parts of Moscow \u2014 a demonstration dispensary, a chemical laboratory, and the Kovarsky institution itself. The center was named the House of Soviet Dentistry (HSD) and among its main purposes were the retraining of former dentists into oral care consultants, and the preparation of secondary dental personnel, such as dental mechanics, filling and prosthetic specialists, and chair side assistants. \n\nFirst renamed in December, 1920, the HSD's official opening took place two years later in April 1922, when again it was given a different name. This time it was the State Institute of Dentistry (SID), which was to be headed by M.\u0412. Yankovsky, who directed his staff in an in-depth study of Dentistry and [[Odontology]] before anything else; the two major problems to be solved were [[tooth decay]] and [[periodontal disease]]. Among those who joined efforts in the study of these problems were scientists such as professors Ya.S. Utshtem, M.S. Nemenov, M.\u041e. Kovarsky, N.M.  Vilnik, and A.I. Yevdokimov, who replaced M.\u0412. Yankovsky at the post after his death in January 1923. A.I. Yevdokimov made large contributions of his own in the SID's development and that earned him the titles of [[Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation]], a corresponding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR and of [[Hero of Socialist Labor]]. Another new name, that of the State Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SISO) was given in April 1927 by decree of the [[Sovnarkom]] (the Soviet government). The SISO was to continue the job of training dentists through a specially organized refresher course for dental professionals and a dental specialization course for general medicine faculties. This helped to streamline the public dental health care as well as carry on with scientific research in the fields of dental and oral pathology and therapy, [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[orthodontics]], and [[prosthodontics]].\n\nIn 1932, the SISO was renamed yet again, this time to the State Research Institute of Stomatology and Odontology (SRISO) and from then on it was concerned mostly with scientific research problems. There were no educational departments in it at the time, those having been replaced by newly formed divisions for pathological [[physiology]], morphology, [[surgery]] and social dentistry instead, to which a steel prosthetics laboratory was added. Another, central, laboratory for prosthetics research was set up a year later in 1933 to manufacture steel dentures on a large scale.\n\n== Years as Moscow Stomatological Institute ==\n\nThe Moscow Stomatological Institute (MSI) as a higher dental school was established under the Narkomzdrav's order dated June 9, 1935, as a subdivision within the SRISO's framework. Both institutions were housed in one building, sharing administration, finances and facilities. Thus, the MSI became the only institution in the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic (RSFSR) that was to conduct scientific research in dentistry, translate the results obtained into everyday dental care practices and train dental professionals as well. Since 1935 a whole number of departments were being added to the institute those of normal anatomy, biology, general chemistry, histology, embryology, and, finally, in 1937 the departments of oral therapy, oral surgery and prosthodontics.\n\nIn line with the resolution of the RSFSR Narkomzdrav of September 1, 1939, the SRISO and MSI were united to become the Moscow State Stomatology Institute (MSSI) with associate professor D. S. Dyshlis as Director. That year witnessed the first batch of 79 graduates trained by the new institution. By the time World War II broke out, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute included 25 departments involved in the studies of dental caries, [[periodontitis]], oral mucous membrane lesions, and maxillofacial injuries.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the MSSI's 1941 graduates were called up to serve in the Red Army or Navy. Among the graduates were V.I. Zausaev who operated on an open heart in a field hospital and who later became a professor and a department head, G.M. Ivaschenko who joined the Army as Chief Dentist, A.I. Doimkov and V.F. Rudko who also gained professorship after the war. To provide the front with dentists, the MSSI put up a special crash course in October, 1941. The MSSI's director, associate professor D.S. Dyshlis, was sent to Izhevsk to make all the necessary arrangements for evacuating the institute to that town, but then the idea was given up. Instead, the MSSI premises in Dolgorukovskaya Street were used to lay out a 50-bed maxillofacial hospital staffed with the institute's polyclinical personnel and the Dentistry department undergraduates. Because of this, over 85% of soldiers with maxillofacial wounds were able to return to the front unscathed. On October 1, 1943, the Moscow State Stomatology Institute opened its doors to students again and about a year later, in February, 1944, A.I.  Yevdokimov was appointed its director.\n\n== After [[World War II]] and [[Khrushchev Thaw]] ==\n\nAfter the war the training of dental care professionals became vital again. So on October 15, 1949, by decision of the USSR Council of Ministers, former dental schools were reorganized into general medicine and dentistry institutes with a 5-year course of studies. The Moscow State Stomatology Institute was again renamed to become the Moscow Medical Stomatology Institute (MMSI), which became famous as the country's research and consulting center on all dentistry-related issues.\n\nIn 1950, associate professor G.N. Beletskiy, a prominent public health worker, was appointed as MMSI director Under his leadership, a student enrollment to the institution went up significantly, the existing clinical medicine facilities were enlarged and new teaching hospitals went under construction, the standards of training research and teaching staff also having much improved. Moreover, two more faculties were launched, part-time and correspondence ones.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, the institute was headed by Prof A.I. Doimkov. For many years professor he acted as Chief Dentist of the USSR Ministry of Health administration division No 4 that was in charge of providing dental services to members of the Soviet government and top officials from other countries.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1968, the post of Rector of the MMSI was held by Professor S.I. Babichev, head of the institute's Surgical Disease department. It was he who initiated the idea of incorporating a General Medicine Faculty into the MMSI. On the basis of the Eye Disease department led by Prof S.N. Fyodorov an ophthalmologic research laboratory was created in 1967. The research staff under Prof S.N. Fyodorv looked into a wide range of scientific and practical problems of eye disorders and that, having eventually crowned with success, allowed him to turn the laboratory into what is now known internationally as the Microsurgery of the Eye scientific research institute.\n\n== [[Brezhnev era|Brezhnev years]] and [[Perestroika]] ==\n\nDuring the period of time from 1968 to 1974 when the institute was headed by Prof A.Z. Belousov, the proposal of setting up a general medicine faculty won his support and was realized in 1968. The emergence of the new faculty that was to cater for the need in medical professionals by the city of Moscow and its surroundings called for employment of more teaching staff for a number of the existing departments (those of Foreign Languages, Anatomy, Physiology, Biology, Histology, Physics and General Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology and others) as well as for putting up new courses and departments. These were launched a year later, staffed with qualified specialists and office workers that helped improve the work of the Faculty's administration and dean's offices. That same year, the MMSI opened an advanced training faculty for medical professionals with departments for dental and general practitioners which was followed by opening in 1975 of a faculty for advanced training of teaching staff.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Professor \u041a.M. Lakin, corresponding member of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]], headed the institution. He proved very successful with his studies of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disease prevention and treatment, the results of which have been widely applied in medical practice. Working in this field he virtually laid the foundation of the hemostasis pharmacology school. His time at the MMSI is marked by putting into operation a Clinical Dentistry Center in Moscow in 1976. It was designed to cater for 2 000 out-patients and 50 in-patients a day and housed a number of the Institute's dental teaching hospital departments.\n\n== In modern Russia ==\n\nThe decades that followed (1982 to 2002) saw Professor Ye.I. Sokolov as the Rector. As head of the Internal Disease department, he became known for his research into the problems of ischemic heart disease, correction of hemostasis disturbances, and clinical psychophysiology, which brought him success and were immediately put to medical use. Under Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's leadership, the Dentistry faculty premises were greatly enlarged and new departments added to both Dentistry and General Medicine faculties, as well as output of graduates increased. In 1986 \u0430 part-time faculty for dental students was opened, in 1995 - that for post-graduate students, and, in 1998, a secondary medical education faculty was launched to train dental mechanics. Two more to come were a refresher course for dental specialists and the Clinical Psychology faculty, in 1999 and 2001 respectively. Towards the end of the decade, another change of name was in store for the Institution, this time by the orders of the Ministries for General and Vocational Education and that for Public Health of the Russian Federation (RF) dated June 10, 1999. These granted the MMSI a university status with a full name from then on of Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry (MSUMD) under the RF Ministry of Public Health.\n\n= Rector of the University =\n\nDuring the five years after Professor Ye.I. Sokolov's resignation in 2002 the University was led by Professor N.D. Yushchuk, a RAS and RAMS academician, RF Honored Scientist, government prize winner, head of the University's Infectious Disease and Epidemiology department. The department's staff is known to take an active part in the work of the Moscow and All-Russia scientific societies of infectionists, microbiologists, epidemiologists and parasitologists, many being members on those societies' boards. This helped to spread new ideas within the country's medical community. The rector paid great attention to the introduction of latest techniques of teaching and assessment of higher school and post-graduate students into the university's practice taking due account of latest pedagogy and medical psychology techniques. Professor N.D. Yuschuk was an active participant in the development of a new effective test control system aimed at better assessment of students' progress. The system was first tried at the time of state assessment of MSMDU students upon graduation and later approved for use by other medical colleges in Russia. It was under Prof N.D. Yuschuk that a scheme was developed, and is now successfully used, for a continuous medical education when a higher medical is to be followed by postgraduate courses (internship, residency, specialization, retraining, and refresher). As to the university's new educational facilities that sprang into being in 2002, they include the faculty of Health Economics and Management (2004), the Moscow Region faculty (2005), and that of Penitentiary Medicine (2006).\n\nOn May 15, 2007, Professor O.O. Yanushevich, head of the MSMDU Periodontology and Geriatric Dentistry department, was elected rector in a ballot by a university staff meeting that was also unanimous in voting for the former rector, academician N.D. Yuschuk, as the University President.\n\nHimself a graduate of the MSUMD, the Rector elected worked for a number of years at the University's Hospital Oral Therapy Department. Today, he has over 50 scientific papers on topical periodontal problems to his credit.\n\n= Notable faculty =\n* Oleg Yanushevich, DDM - rector of MSUMD, professor, honored doctor of Russia.\n* [[Anatoly Sharpenak]] (1895 - 1969) - scholar and biochemist, Professor.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

(humanity)|human development]] by combining measurements of [[life expectancy]], [[education]], and [[per capita income]] into the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) in its annual [[Human Development Report]].\n\nThe HDI is a summary index using [[life expectancy at birth]], expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults, and [[GNI per capita]]. The final HDI is a value between 0 and 1 with countries grouped into four categories depending on the value, very high for HDI of 0.800 and above, high from 0.700 to 0.799, medium from 0.550 to 0.699 and low below 0.550.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Technical notes 2019\">{{cite web |title=Human Development Report 2019 \u2013 Technical notes |url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019_technical_notes.pdf |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Human Development Report has been published most years since 1990.

The report stated that while the HDI remains useful, \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality)\" and \"the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human development (or the maximum IHDI that could be achieved if there were no inequality)\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Human Development Report 2010 |date=2010 |publisher=[[United Nations Development

Tolkien]]'s world of [[Middle-earth]], but the ''[[Rolemaster]]'' rules system, and its science-fiction equivalent, ''Spacemaster'', have been the foundation of ICE's business.\n\n==History==\nIn college in the late 1970s, while running a six-year ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' campaign set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, [[Pete Fenlon]], [[S. Coleman Charlton]], and [[Kurt Fischer (game designer)|Kurt Fischer]] began to develop a set of unique house rules; after most of them had graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1980, many of the group's principals decided to turn their rules into a business and formed Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), named after a regalia of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|133}} Besides Fenlon and Charlton, the original ICE also included [[Rick Britton|Richard H. Britton]], [[Terry K. Amthor]], [[Bruce Shelley]], [[Bruce Neidlinger]], Kurt Fischer, [[Heike Kubasch]], Olivia Johnston, and a few others.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nICE was incorporated in 1980, shortly after the youngest of the principal founders graduated from the [[University of Virginia]]. Among the founders were [[Pete Fenlon]] (then in Law school), [[Rick Britton]], [[S. Coleman Charlton]], Bruce Neidlinger, [[Terry K. Amthor]], Kurt Fischer, [[Bruce Shelley]], and [[Heike Kubasch]]. The company originally only had a few full-time staff, relying on volunteer work from the other founders. But as income increased, it brought more on as employees.<ref>http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/tabletop/columns/days-of-high-adventure/7337-Rolemaster-Puppetmaster-Catan-Master-Pete-Fenlon</ref>\n\nICE quickly published three products: ''[[Arms Law]]'' (1980), ''The Iron Wind'' (1980), and ''Manassas'' (1981).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}} ''Arms Law'' was the first release of the house rules from the University of Virginia days, and thus became the start of ''[[Rolemaster]]'', although at that time ''Rolemaster'' was not seen as a standalone RPG but was offered as an alternative combat system for ''AD&D''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}} ''The Iron Wind'' was a system-generic campaign centered on a fantastic island, and although it was unsupplemented for years it would eventually be recognized as the first release in ICE's ''Loremaster'' campaign setting.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}} ''Manassas'' was a Civil War era [[Miniature wargaming|wargame]] set in ICE's home state of Virginia.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nICE began by publishing a series of rules supplements, beginning with \"[[Arms Law]]\", which were intended to serve as modular add-ons to other RPG systems offering greater detail. This was followed by \"[[Spell Law]]\" and Character/Campaign Law.\" In time, these supplements were tied together to form an RPG system of their own, ''[[Rolemaster]]''. Concurrent with the rules supplements, ICE began releasing world campaign content materials in what was originally called the \"Loremaster\" series, beginning with \"Iron Wind\".\n\n''Rolemaster'' had grown out of a Middle-earth game, so ICE approached [[Tolkien Enterprises]] seeking a license to ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', which Tolkien Enterprises granted because no one else had ever asked.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|134}} Tolkien Enterprises signed an exclusive, worldwide license with ICE in 1982, and ICE started the Middle-earth line off with a generic sourcebook that could be used with AD&D or other games, called ''A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth'' (1982).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nThe company enjoyed a sudden jump in status when it acquired the license to produce an official fantasy RPG based upon [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of [[Middle-earth]], which would come to be known as ''MERP'' (\"[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]\"). According to some interpretations, at the time of its publication ICE's ''Middle-earth Role Playing'' was the second best selling fantasy RPG after [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\nICE then added the science fiction RPGs ''[[Spacemaster]]'' and ''[[Cyberspace (role-playing game)|Cyberspace]]'' to its line, and, with the rise of [[collectible card game]]s, the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''. ICE also published a moderately successful space miniatures battle game called ''[[Silent Death]]'', based on ''Spacemaster'' but with simpler mechanics. ''Silent Death'' was released in two major editions, with supplemental books and a fair number of paintable lead miniatures.<ref name=\"bh8\">{{cite web |last=Appelcline  |first=Shannon  |coauthors= |title= #8:  ICE, Part One: 1980-1992 |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory8.phtml |date=2006-11-21 |work=A Brief History of Game  |publisher=RPGnet |accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref> ICE also expanded its original Loremaster supplements into a full-blown fantasy world to support [[Rolemaster]], called the [[Shadow World (role playing game)|Shadow World]], supported by dozens of adventures and sourcebooks. ICE signed in 1986 a publication contract to take over [[Hero Games]]' production and distribution.  Later with Hero Games staff leaving for other jobs, ICE took over the creative reins of Hero's products.<ref name=\"bh8\"/>\n\nIron Crown branched out into the solo gaming books under the Tolkien Quest (later called Middle-earth Quest) and Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries book lines.<ref name=\"bh8\"/> Unknown to ICE at the time, the Middle-earth Quest books violated ICE and Tolkien Enterprises' contract with Tolkien's book publishing licensee, George Allen & Unwin. (ICE and TE considered the books to be games, and so fall under their license, but the format came too close to being literary books). ICE was forced to recall and destroy the whole line of books, at devastating cost.  Meanwhile, ICE sued the Narnia licensor as they turned out to not have the necessary rights to license Narnia to ICE.  That company went bankrupt from the legal settlement and was unable to pay ICE their damages.  ICE reached terms in 1988 for a gamebook license with the estate of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Allen & Unwin for four new Middle-earth Quest books, beginning with \"Spy in Isengard\".  However, the solo game book market was going soft by this time.  ICE canceled all solo game book lines, with dozens of books still in development.  Returns were high on the [[Sherlock Holmes]] Solo Mysteries line.  All this brought ICE to near bankruptcy in a \"voluntary-type of receivership\".<ref name=\"bh8\"/>\n\nDespite ICE's many successes and overcoming many setbacks over 17 years, in 1997 ICE suffered financial difficulties from a rapid decline in its distribution net; nearly 70% of ICE's distributors either went bankrupt or became moribund. There has been some debate over whether Tolkien Enterprises forced ICE into bankruptcy in order to get the gaming license in anticipation of the upcoming new movie franchise.<ref name=\"rpg.net\">https://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory9.phtml</ref>\n\nThe company entered bankruptcy and filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] in October 2000. This bankruptcy cost ICE the Middle-earth license, ending both the [[MERP]] and [[Collectible card game|CCG]] lines. Many of the authors and illustrators were not paid for substantial amounts of work.<ref name=\"rpg.net\"/>\n\n===Aurigas Aldebaron===\n[[File:Ironcrownenterprises.png|thumb|right|ICE's logo since relaunch]]\nIn December 2001, ICE's assets were purchased by [[Aurigas Aldebaron]] LLLC, an [[intellectual property]] ownership company backed by several wealthy individuals.  The new owners licensed the Iron Crown Enterprise name and other assets to [[Mjolnir LLC]] until 2011. Starting in January 2011, licensing was transferred to Guild Companion Publications Ltd.\n\nIn 2016 Aurigas Alderbaron merged with Guild Companion Publications Ltd to create a single company: Guild Companion Publications.

Many of ICE's better-known products were related to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of [[Middle-earth]], but the ''[[Rolemaster]]'' rules system, and its science-fiction equivalent, ''Spacemaster'', have been the foundation of ICE's business.\n\n==History==\nIn college in the late 1970s, while running a six-year ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' campaign set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, [[Pete Fenlon]], [[S. Coleman Charlton]], and [[Kurt Fischer (game designer)|Kurt Fischer]] began to develop a set of unique house rules; after most of them had graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1980, many of the group's principals decided to turn their rules into a business and formed Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE), named after a regalia of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|133}} Besides Fenlon and Charlton, the original ICE also included [[Rick Britton|Richard H. Britton]], [[Terry K. Amthor]], [[Bruce Shelley]], [[Bruce Neidlinger]], Kurt Fischer, [[Heike Kubasch]], Olivia Johnston, and a few others.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nICE was incorporated in 1980, shortly after the youngest of the principal founders graduated from the [[University of Virginia]]. Among the founders were [[Pete Fenlon]] (then in Law school), [[Rick Britton]], [[S. Coleman Charlton]], Bruce Neidlinger, [[Terry K. Amthor]], Kurt Fischer, [[Bruce Shelley]], and [[Heike Kubasch]]. The company originally only had a few full-time staff, relying on volunteer work from the other founders. But as income increased, it brought more on as employees.<ref>http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/tabletop/columns/days-of-high-adventure/7337-Rolemaster-Puppetmaster-Catan-Master-Pete-Fenlon</ref>\n\nICE quickly published three products: ''[[Arms Law]]'' (1980), ''The Iron Wind'' (1980), and ''Manassas'' (1981).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}} ''Arms Law'' was the first release of the house rules from the University of Virginia days, and thus became the start of ''[[Rolemaster]]'', although at that time ''Rolemaster'' was not seen as a standalone RPG but was offered as an alternative combat system for ''AD&D''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}} ''The Iron Wind'' was a system-generic campaign centered on a fantastic island, and although it was unsupplemented for years it would eventually be recognized as the first release in ICE's ''Loremaster'' campaign setting.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}} ''Manassas'' was a Civil War era [[Miniature wargaming|wargame]] set in ICE's home state of Virginia.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|133}}\n\nICE began by publishing a series of rules supplements, beginning with \"[[Arms Law]]\", which were intended to serve as modular add-ons to other RPG systems offering greater detail. This was followed by \"[[Spell Law]]\" and Character/Campaign Law.\" In time, these supplements were tied together to form an RPG system of their own, ''[[Rolemaster]]''. Concurrent with the rules supplements, ICE began releasing world campaign content materials in what was originally called the \"Loremaster\" series, beginning with \"Iron Wind\".\n\n''Rolemaster'' had grown out of a Middle-earth game, so ICE approached [[Tolkien Enterprises]] seeking a license to ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', which Tolkien Enterprises granted because no one else had ever asked.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|134}} Tolkien Enterprises signed an exclusive, worldwide license with ICE in 1982, and ICE started the Middle-earth line off with a generic sourcebook that could be used with AD&D or other games, called ''A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth'' (1982).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\nThe company enjoyed a sudden jump in status when it acquired the license to produce an official fantasy RPG based upon [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s world of [[Middle-earth]], which would come to be known as ''MERP'' (\"[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]\"). According to some interpretations, at the time of its publication ICE's ''Middle-earth Role Playing'' was the second best selling fantasy RPG after [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]'s ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\nICE then added the science fiction RPGs ''[[Spacemaster]]'' and ''[[Cyberspace (role-playing game)|Cyberspace]]'' to its line, and, with the rise of [[collectible card game]]s, the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''. ICE also published a moderately successful space miniatures battle game called ''[[Silent Death]]'', based on ''Spacemaster'' but with simpler mechanics. ''Silent Death'' was released in two major editions, with supplemental books and a fair number of paintable lead miniatures.<ref name=\"bh8\">{{cite web |last=Appelcline  |first=Shannon  |coauthors= |title= #8:  ICE, Part One: 1980-1992 |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory8.phtml |date=2006-11-21 |work=A Brief History of Game  |publisher=RPGnet |accessdate=10 July 2009}}</ref> ICE also expanded its original Loremaster supplements into a full-blown fantasy world to support [[Rolemaster]], called the [[Shadow World (role playing game)|Shadow World]], supported by dozens of adventures and sourcebooks. ICE signed in 1986 a publication contract to take over [[Hero Games]]' production and distribution.  Later with Hero Games staff leaving for other jobs, ICE took over the creative reins of Hero's products.<ref name=\"bh8\"/>\n\nIron Crown branched out into the solo gaming books under the Tolkien Quest (later called Middle-earth Quest) and Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries book lines.<ref name=\"bh8\"/> Unknown to ICE at the time, the Middle-earth Quest books violated ICE and Tolkien Enterprises' contract with Tolkien's book publishing licensee, George Allen & Unwin. (ICE and TE considered the books to be games, and so fall under their license, but the format came too close to being literary books). ICE was forced to recall and destroy the whole line of books, at devastating cost.  Meanwhile, ICE sued the Narnia licensor as they turned out to not have the necessary rights to license Narnia to ICE.  That company went bankrupt from the legal settlement and was unable to pay ICE their damages.  ICE reached terms in 1988 for a gamebook license with the estate of J.R.R. Tolkien and George Allen & Unwin for four new Middle-earth Quest books, beginning with \"Spy in Isengard\".  However, the solo game book market was going soft by this time.  ICE canceled all solo game book lines, with dozens of books still in development.  Returns were high on the [[Sherlock Holmes]] Solo Mysteries line.  All this brought ICE to near bankruptcy in a \"voluntary-type of receivership\".<ref name=\"bh8\"/>\n\nDespite ICE's many successes and overcoming many setbacks over 17 years, in 1997 ICE suffered financial difficulties from a rapid decline in its distribution net; nearly 70% of ICE's distributors either went bankrupt or became moribund. There has been some debate over whether Tolkien Enterprises forced ICE into bankruptcy in order to get the gaming license in anticipation of the upcoming new movie franchise.<ref name=\"rpg.net\">https://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory9.phtml</ref>\n\nThe company entered bankruptcy and filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] in October 2000. This bankruptcy cost ICE the Middle-earth license, ending both the [[MERP]] and [[Collectible card game|CCG]] lines. Many of the authors and illustrators were not paid for substantial amounts of work.<ref name=\"rpg.net\"/>\n\n===Aurigas Aldebaron===\n[[File:Ironcrownenterprises.png|thumb|right|ICE's logo since relaunch]]\nIn December 2001, ICE's assets were purchased by [[Aurigas Aldebaron]] LLLC, an [[intellectual property]] ownership company backed by several wealthy individuals.  The new owners licensed the Iron Crown Enterprise name and other assets to [[Mjolnir LLC]] until 2011. Starting in January 2011, licensing was transferred to Guild Companion Publications Ltd.\n\nIn 2016 Aurigas Alderbaron merged with Guild Companion Publications Ltd to create a single company: Guild Companion Publications.
