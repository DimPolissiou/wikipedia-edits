Club DJs picked up on this and both tracks became club floor-fillers. The concept of the [[big beat]] sound was later picked up on and adapted by many club DJs and went on to become widely used by many successful musicians throughout the 1990s.\n\n===1989: Arabic Circus Tour===\n[[File:Laurence Malice and Iain Williams of Big Bang performing on stage during their 1989 Arabic Circus Tour-horz.jpg|thumb|left|Laurence Malice (left) and Iain Williams (right) of Big Bang performing on stage during their 1989 Arabic Circus Tour]]\nDuring 1989, Big Bang performed several concerts to publicise the release of ''[[Voulez-Vous (song)|Voulez-Vous]]'' with their lavish Arabic Circus Tour that consisted of various circus acts including acrobats, one-wheel bicycle riders, fire-eaters, jugglers, flying trapeze artists and a belly-dancing troupe.<ref name=to200989>''Time Out'', 20 September 1989, page 5 & 93, Big Bang Arabic Circus Tour</ref> Big Bang were joined on stage by the vocalists Teresa Revill and Jasmine Ventura.
