Released nineteen years after [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|the previous film]], the film is set in 1957, pitting [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|agents]]\u2014led by Irina Spalko ([[Cate Blanchett]])\u2014searching for a [[telepath]]ic [[crystal skull]]. Jones is aided by his former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), and her son, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Mutt Williams|Mutt Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]). [[Ray Winstone]], [[John Hurt]], and [[Jim Broadbent]] are also part of the supporting cast.\n\nScreenwriters [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]], [[Jeffrey Boam]], [[Frank Darabont]], and [[Jeff Nathanson]] wrote drafts before [[David Koepp]]'s script satisfied the producers. The filmmakers intended to pay tribute to the [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)|science fiction B-movies of the 1950s era]]. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in [[New Mexico]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Fresno, California]], as well as on [[sound stage]]s in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional [[Stunt|stunt work]] instead of computer-generated [[stunt double]]s, and [[cinematographer]] [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] studied [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style from the previous films.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 18, 2008, and was released worldwide on May 22, 2008 and received generally mixed reviews, with critics praising the film for the performances, action scenes, John Williams' musical score, and the costume design, but criticizing the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and overuse of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $790 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, as well as the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2008]]. A fifth film is scheduled for release on July 9, 2021, with Ford set to reprise his role.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/indiana-jones-5-release-date-pushed-again-2021-1125975 |title=Disney Pushes 'Indiana Jones 5' a Year to 2021; Dates 'Maleficent,' 'Jungle Cruise' |last=McClintock |first=Pamela |date=July 10, 2018 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1957, [[Indiana Jones]] and his partner George \"Mac\" McHale are kidnapped from Mexico where they were digging for trinkets by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB|agents]] under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko, who infiltrate a secret [[Nevada]] warehouse labeled \"[[Area 51|Hangar 51]]\" and force Jones to locate a mummified corpse (implied to come from the [[Roswell UFO incident]],10 years earlier, on which he was forced to work). Upon its discovery, Mac reveals he has become a [[double agent]] working for the Soviets. After an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the body and a fight with Spalko's henchman Dovchenko, Jones escapes to a model town at the [[Nevada Test Site]], minutes before an [[atomic bomb]] test. He takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator and is rescued, decontaminated, and interrogated by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, who suspect him of working for the Soviets. Though freed by the recommendation of General Ross, he ends up put on indefinite [[leave of absence]] from Marshall College. His leaving also causes the dean's resignation to keep Indiana's job at the college.\n\nJones is approached by [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] Mutt Williams, who tells him Harold Oxley found a [[crystal skull]] in Peru and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator, and Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient language. [[KGB]] agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape and,  finding and following the riddle's meaning, reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of [[Francisco de Orellana]], a [[Conquistador]] who searched for Akator. They find the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning Oxley had returned it there.\n\nJones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the [[Amazon jungle]], where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, [[Marion Ravenwood]], who reveals that Mutt is Jones\u2019 son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great [[psychic]] power, and finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his allies try to escape, but Marion and Jones get caught in a [[Dry quicksand|dry sandpit]], and are recaptured by the Soviets. While on their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] double-agent to regain Jones' trust. Jones and his team fight their way out of the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by [[Dorylus|siafu ants]]. After surviving three waterfalls in an [[GAZ 46|amphibious vehicle]], Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.\n\nJones' team evade the city's guardians, gain access to the temple, and find it filled with artifacts from many [[Civilization|ancient civilizations]], identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional \"[[Ancient astronauts|archaeologists]]\" [[Xenoarchaeology|studying]] the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing thirteen crystal skeletons, the tenth missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. Spalko immediately demands to know everything and the aliens transfer their knowledge into her mind. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into it. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley (who has regained his sanity) escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is sucked in too after he willingly lets go of Jones' whip. Jones' team escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a [[flying saucer]] rising from under the ground and vanishing into the \"space between spaces\", while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.\n\nThe following year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean, and he and Marion are married.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Indianajones4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|[[Harrison Ford]] during the filming of the movie.]]\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]; To prepare for the role, the 64<!-- don't change, he turned 65 during filming which is after the training-->-year-old Ford spent three hours a day at a gym, practiced with the [[bullwhip]] for two weeks,<ref name=pre/> and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1270011.php |title=Indiana Jones 4: A fit Ford |last= |first= |date=February 27, 2007 |work=Monsters and Critics |accessdate=March 29, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601184608/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_1270011.php|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-02-12-indiana-jones_N.htm |title=Here come Harrison (in fine form) and 'Indiana Jones' |author=Bowles |first=Scott |date=February 12, 2008 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=February 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Gannett]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620071127/https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-02-12-indiana-jones_N.htm|archive-date=2009-06-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> He performed many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance.<ref name=\"ford\" /> He argued, \"The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness.

Skull''''' is a 2008 American [[action film|action]]-[[adventure film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and the fourth installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' series]]. Released nineteen years after [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|the previous film]], the film is set in 1957, pitting [[Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Espionage|agents]]\u2014led by Irina Spalko ([[Cate Blanchett]])\u2014searching for a [[telepath]]ic [[crystal skull]]. Jones is aided by his former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), and her son, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Mutt Williams|Mutt Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]). [[Ray Winstone]], [[John Hurt]], and [[Jim Broadbent]] are also part of the supporting cast.\n\nScreenwriters [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]], [[Jeffrey Boam]], [[Frank Darabont]], and [[Jeff Nathanson]] wrote drafts before [[David Koepp]]'s script satisfied the producers. The filmmakers intended to pay tribute to the [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)|science fiction B-movies of the 1950s era]]. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in [[New Mexico]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Fresno, California]], as well as on [[sound stage]]s in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional [[Stunt|stunt work]] instead of computer-generated [[stunt double]]s, and [[cinematographer]] [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] studied [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style from the previous films.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 18, 2008, and was released worldwide on May 22, 2008 and received generally mixed reviews, with critics praising the film for the performances, action scenes, John Williams' musical score, and the costume design, but criticizing the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and overuse of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $790 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, as well as the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2008]]. A fifth film is scheduled for release on July 9, 2021, with Ford set to reprise his role. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/indiana-jones-5-release-date-pushed-again-2021-1125975 |title=Disney Pushes 'Indiana Jones 5' a Year to 2021; Dates 'Maleficent,' 'Jungle Cruise' |last=McClintock |first=Pamela |date=July 10, 2018 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1957, [[Indiana Jones]] and his partner George \"Mac\" McHale are kidnapped from Mexico where they were digging for trinkets by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB|agents]] under Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko, who infiltrate a secret [[Nevada]] warehouse labeled \"[[Area 51|Hangar 51]]\" and force Jones to locate a mummified corpse (implied to come from the [[Roswell UFO incident]],10 years earlier, on which he was forced to work). Upon its discovery, Mac reveals he has become a [[double agent]] working for the Soviets. After an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve the body and a fight with Spalko's henchman Dovchenko, Jones escapes to a model town at the [[Nevada Test Site]], minutes before an [[atomic bomb]] test. He takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator and is rescued, decontaminated, and interrogated by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, who suspect him of working for the Soviets. Though freed by the recommendation of General Ross, he ends up put on indefinite [[leave of absence]] from Marshall College. His leaving also causes the dean's resignation to keep Indiana's job at the college.\n\nJones is approached by [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] Mutt Williams, who tells him Harold Oxley found a [[crystal skull]] in Peru and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator, and Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient language. [[KGB]] agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape and,  finding and following the riddle's meaning, reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles on the walls and floor of his cell lead them to the grave of [[Francisco de Orellana]], a [[Conquistador]] who searched for Akator. They find the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning Oxley had returned it there.\n\nJones and Mutt are captured by Mac and the Soviets and taken to their camp in the [[Amazon jungle]], where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, [[Marion Ravenwood]], who reveals that Mutt is Jones\u2019 son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great [[psychic]] power, and finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his allies try to escape, but Marion and Jones get caught in a [[Dry quicksand|dry sandpit]], and are recaptured by the Soviets. While on their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] double-agent to regain Jones' trust. Jones and his team fight their way out of the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by [[Dorylus|siafu ants]]. After surviving three waterfalls in an [[GAZ 46|amphibious vehicle]], Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.\n\nJones' team evade the city's guardians, gain access to the temple, and find it filled with artifacts from many [[Civilization|ancient civilizations]], identifying the aliens as extra-dimensional \"[[Ancient astronauts|archaeologists]]\" [[Xenoarchaeology|studying]] the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing thirteen crystal skeletons, the tenth missing its skull. Spalko arrives and presents the skull to its skeleton, whereupon the aliens reanimate and telepathically offer a reward in ancient Mayan through Oxley. Spalko immediately demands to know everything and the aliens transfer their knowledge into her mind. A portal to their dimension becomes activated, and the other remaining Soviets are drawn into it. As Jones, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley (who has regained his sanity) escape, the thirteen beings fuse into one, and in the process of receiving the overwhelming knowledge, Spalko is disintegrated and sucked into the portal. Mac is sucked in too after he willingly lets go of Jones' whip. Jones' team escape and watch as the city crumbles, revealing a [[flying saucer]] rising from under the ground and vanishing into the \"space between spaces\", while the hollow in the valley floor left by its departure is flooded by the waters of the Amazon.\n\nThe following year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College and made an associate dean, and he and Marion are married.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Indianajones4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|[[Harrison Ford]] during the filming of the movie.]]\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]; To prepare for the role, the 64<!-- don't change, he turned 65 during filming which is after the training-->-year-old Ford spent three hours a day at a gym, practiced with the [[bullwhip]] for two weeks,<ref name=pre/> and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1270011.php |title=Indiana Jones 4: A fit Ford |last= |first= |date=February 27, 2007 |work=Monsters and Critics |accessdate=March 29, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601184608/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_1270011.php|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-02-12-indiana-jones_N.htm |title=Here come Harrison (in fine form) and 'Indiana Jones' |author=Bowles |first=Scott |date=February 12, 2008 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=February 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Gannett]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620071127/https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-02-12-indiana-jones_N.htm|archive-date=2009-06-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> He performed many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance.<ref name=\"ford\" /> He argued, \"The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness.

{"title_page": "List of NHS trusts", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2019}}\nThis is a list of [[NHS trust]]s established in [[England]]. It includes Acute Hospital Trusts, [[NHS ambulance services prior to 2006|Ambulance Trusts]], Mental Health Trusts, and the unique [[Isle of Wight NHS Trust]]. Many trusts have dissolved or have changed their name, and each is listed separately, under each significant name.  If the same trust has continued with only a slight name change, it is only listed once, with the latest name.\n\n[[Community Health NHS Trust]]s present particular difficulties. Like all the trusts they were originally established under the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]]. They have been frequently merged, split and reorganised, sometimes combined with hospital trusts or mental health trusts. After 2001 most of them were  subsumed into [[Primary Care Trust]]s and under the [[Transforming Community Services]] programme they were then re-established in various organisational forms, not always within the NHS. A further wave of community trusts were established between 2010 and 2013 when PCTs were abolished, sometimes reusing a previous name.\n\nThere is a separate [[List of Primary Care Trusts in England]] which did not have the same legal status.\n\nDates of mergers and dissolutions are generally the date of legislation.  The operational date may be different.\n\n* For the distinct system of [[NHS Health Board]]s in Scotland, see [[NHS Scotland]]\n* For the system in Northern Ireland, see [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]\n* For the system in Wales, see [[NHS Wales]]\n\n[[NHS Foundation Trusts]] were regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]].  Trusts that had not attained Foundation Trust status were supervised by the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]].  From 1 April 2016 they are all supervised by [[NHS Improvement]].\n\n__NOTOC__\n{{compact ToC|num=yes|refs=yes|extlinks=yes}}\n\n==0-9==\n* [[2gether NHS Foundation Trust]] merged into

(England)]]\n[[Category:NHS trusts|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2019}}\nThis is a list of [[NHS trust]]s established in [[England]]. It includes Acute Hospital Trusts, [[NHS ambulance services prior to 2006|Ambulance Trusts]], Mental Health Trusts, and the unique [[Isle of Wight NHS Trust]]. Many trusts have dissolved or have changed their name, and each is listed separately, under each significant name.  If the same trust has continued with only a slight name change, it is only listed once, with the latest name.\n\n[[Community Health NHS Trust]]s present particular difficulties. Like all the trusts they were originally established under the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]]. They have been frequently merged, split and reorganised, sometimes combined with hospital trusts or mental health trusts. After 2001 most of them were  subsumed into [[Primary Care Trust]]s and under the [[Transforming Community Services]] programme they were then re-established in various organisational forms, not always within the NHS. A further wave of community trusts were established between 2010 and 2013 when PCTs were abolished, sometimes reusing a previous name.\n\nThere is a separate [[List of Primary Care Trusts in England]] which did not have the same legal status.\n\nDates of mergers and dissolutions are generally the date of legislation.  The operational date may be different.\n\n* For the distinct system of [[NHS Health Board]]s in Scotland, see [[NHS Scotland]]\n* For the system in Northern Ireland, see [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland]]\n* For the system in Wales, see [[NHS Wales]]\n\n[[NHS Foundation Trusts]] were regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]].  Trusts that had not attained Foundation Trust status were supervised by the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]].  From 1 April 2016 they are all supervised by [[NHS Improvement]].\n\n__NOTOC__\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}\n\n==0-9==\n* [[2gether NHS Foundation Trust]] merged into [[Gloucestershire

It gives mid-card wrestlers on ROH's roster something to fight for in the context of trying to win a wrestling match to \"move up the company ladder.\" Caldwell further remarked that \"ROH bringing back the TV Title to national TV is consistent with ROH's current marketing under Jim Cornette to \"re-capture an old-school flavor\" to their product.\"<ref name=\"PWTorchannounced\"/>\n\nAfter the ''Ring of Honor Wrestling'' show was cancelled in March 2011, the title became inactive. Although Daniels stopped defending it, he still carried the belt with him as part of his villainous character. With the sale of ROH to the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] and a new television show scheduled to air in September, ROH reinstated the title for June's Best in The World event.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Will Represent ROH On Broadcast TV?|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/who-will-represent-roh-on-broadcast-tv/|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|accessdate=2011-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=ROH TV Title match announced for \"Best in the World\" Internet PPV this month|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_50599.shtml|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2011-06-08|date=2011-06-07}}</ref>\n\n===Tournament===\n[[File:Eddie_Edwards_at_Smash_2015.jpg|thumb|155px|Inaugural-champion [[Eddie Edward]]]]\nThe tournament was scheduled to span over a two-day weekend, starting on February 5 and ending on February 6 at events recorded for later broadcast on ''Ring of Honor Wrestling''.<ref name=\"WVannounced\"/> However, due to [[February 5\u20136, 2010 North American blizzard#Mid-Atlantic|severe weather conditions]] in the Philadelphia area, the second day of taping was canceled.<ref name=\"cancel\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38804.shtml|title=Ring of Honor cancels tonight's ROH TV taping |last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-02-06|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2010-02-06}}</ref> It was not until almost a month later, on March 5, that ROH held the second recorded event, which closed out the tournament.<ref name=\"WOROHMarch5results\">{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/12560/105/|title=ROH TV tapings from Friday & Saturday night|last=Sosnowski|first=Paul|date=2010-03-05|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref> The first four seeds of eight in the tournament were announced on January 22, 2010: [[Rhett Titus]] (8), [[El Generico]] (7), [[Eddie Edwards (wrestler)|Eddie Edwards]] (6), and [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]] (5).<ref name=\"PWTorchtvtournament1\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38349.shtml|title=ROH News: First four wrestlers announced for TV Title tournament|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-01-22|work=PWTorch.com|publisher=TDH Communications Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> The other four seeds were announced on January 26, 2010: [[Kevin Owens|Kevin Steen]] (1), [[Kenny King (wrestler)|Kenny King]] (2), [[Colt Cabana]] (3), and [[Davey Richards]] (4).<ref name=\"PWTorchtvtournament2\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38445.shtml|title=ROH News: Top four seeds announced for TV Title tournament, Complete Bracket|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-01-26|work=PWTorch.com|publisher=TDH Communications Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> The first round was determined at the first event on February 5, with Steen, King, Richards, and Edwards all advancing to round two.<ref name=\"TVtapingsnight1\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38797.shtml|title=ROH News: Spoilers -

The two small outer plates have a caricature of the earth and a [[satellite]] in [[orbit]]. The middle plates have figures resembling a [[camera operator|cameraman]] filming a television production.

During that reign, Lethal also won the [[ROH World Championship]] in a Title vs. Title match at [[Best in the World 2015]].\n\n==History==\nThe creation of the ROH World Television Championship was announced via ROH's official website on January 20, 2010.<ref name=\"PWTorchannounced\"/><ref name=\"WVannounced\"/> An [[Single-elimination tournament|eight-man single elimination tournament]] was then planned to determine the inaugural champion. The tournament was to start on February 4 and conclude on February 6, 2010 at [[The Arena (Philadelphia)|The Arena]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] at the [[Broadcast delay|tapings]] of ROH's television program ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]''.<ref name=\"WVannounced\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1264017860|title=Ring of Honor to add new TV title|last=Gerweck|first=Steve|date=2010-01-20|work=[[Ring of Honor]]|publisher=WrestleView.com|accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref> Regarding the new championship addition, ROH President Cary Silkin said, \"We\u2019ve been talking about adding a secondary championship for some time. Not only will this give the athletes of Ring of Honor another tremendous goal to work towards, it will also give our great partner, HDNet, a championship that is sure to be defended on the television program. We\u2019re happy to publicly give thanks to HDNet for giving us the chance to add this title to the television show...\".<ref name=\"WVannounced\"/>\n\nIt is ROH's second secondary singles championship in their history. The [[ROH Pure Championship]] was used from February 14, 2004 to August 12, 2006, prior its [[Championship unification#Professional wrestling|unification]] with the [[ROH World Championship]].<ref name=\"titlehistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/rohpuretitle.php|title=ROH Pure Championship reign history|publisher=ROH Wrestling.com|accessdate=2010-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404064124/http://www.rohwrestling.com/rohpuretitle.php <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2010-04-04}}</ref> After the championship announcement, wrestling columnist James Caldwell gave his comments: \"I like the idea. It gives mid-card wrestlers on ROH's roster something to fight for in the context of trying to win a wrestling match to \"move up the company ladder.\" Caldwell further remarked that \"ROH bringing back the TV Title to national TV is consistent with ROH's current marketing under Jim Cornette to \"re-capture an old-school flavor\" to their product.\"<ref name=\"PWTorchannounced\"/>\n\nAfter the ''Ring of Honor Wrestling'' show was cancelled in March 2011, the title became inactive. Although Daniels stopped defending it, he still carried the belt with him as part of his villainous character. With the sale of ROH to the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] and a new television show scheduled to air in September, ROH reinstated the title for June's Best in The World event.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Will Represent ROH On Broadcast TV?|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/who-will-represent-roh-on-broadcast-tv/|publisher=[[Ring of Honor]]|accessdate=2011-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=ROH TV Title match announced for \"Best in the World\" Internet PPV this month|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_50599.shtml|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2011-06-08|date=2011-06-07}}</ref>\n\n===Tournament===\n[[File:Eddie_Edwards_at_Smash_2015.jpg|thumb|155px|Inaugural-champion [[Eddie Edward]]]]\nThe tournament was scheduled to span over a two-day weekend, starting on February 5 and ending on February 6 at events recorded for later broadcast on ''Ring of Honor Wrestling''.<ref name=\"WVannounced\"/> However, due to [[February 5\u20136, 2010 North American blizzard#Mid-Atlantic|severe weather conditions]] in the Philadelphia area, the second day of taping was canceled.<ref name=\"cancel\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38804.shtml|title=Ring of Honor cancels tonight's ROH TV taping |last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-02-06|publisher=PWTorch|accessdate=2010-02-06}}</ref> It was not until almost a month later, on March 5, that ROH held the second recorded event, which closed out the tournament.<ref name=\"WOROHMarch5results\">{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/12560/105/|title=ROH TV tapings from Friday & Saturday night|last=Sosnowski|first=Paul|date=2010-03-05|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|accessdate=2010-04-07}}</ref> The first four seeds of eight in the tournament were announced on January 22, 2010: [[Rhett Titus]] (8), [[El Generico]] (7), [[Eddie Edwards (wrestler)|Eddie Edwards]] (6), and [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]] (5).<ref name=\"PWTorchtvtournament1\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38349.shtml|title=ROH News: First four wrestlers announced for TV Title tournament|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-01-22|work=PWTorch.com|publisher=TDH Communications Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> The other four seeds were announced on January 26, 2010: [[Kevin Owens|Kevin Steen]] (1), [[Kenny King (wrestler)|Kenny King]] (2), [[Colt Cabana]] (3), and [[Davey Richards]] (4).<ref name=\"PWTorchtvtournament2\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38445.shtml|title=ROH News: Top four seeds announced for TV Title tournament, Complete Bracket|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-01-26|work=PWTorch.com|publisher=TDH Communications Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> The first round was determined at the first event on February 5, with Steen, King, Richards, and Edwards all advancing to round two.<ref name=\"TVtapingsnight1\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/ROH_News_29/article_38797.shtml|title=ROH News: Spoilers -

The title's base is a black leather strap that is covered with four small silver plates. The center of the title has one large silver plate. All plates have an inner blue covering. The two small outer plates have a caricature of the earth and a [[satellite]] in [[orbit]]. The middle plates have figures resembling a [[camera operator|cameraman]] filming a television production. Underneath each figure, lies the ROH logo and the words \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\". The central plate has the engravings of the ROH logo as well as the statement \"World Television Wrestling Champion\" hovering above the backdrop of a city, with a television lying on top of a globe with an overhead shot of a wrestling ring between them in front of the [[skyline]].<ref group=\"N\" name=\"design\">This description is based on the first design of the ROH World Television Championship, as seen in the images throughout the article.</ref> The design was changed again in November 2012 to its current design during the reign of Adam Cole, the new design seemed to be based on the [[WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"tvresults\">[http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/roh-tv-results ROH TV Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124200616/http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/roh-tv-results |date=2013-01-24 }}, rohwrestling.com</ref> During [[Jay Lethal]]'s record-setting reign, the belt design was modified to emphasize the \"ROH Champion\" portion of the title, with Lethal claiming the championship was more prestigious than the [[ROH World Championship]] because he was the champion.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, ROH announced on their YouTube page that their World Tag, Six Man World Tag Team, and World Television Championships will receive new designs which will debut at the next set of television tapings.\n\n==Reigns==\nOverall, there have been 23 reigns by 19 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Eddie Edwards, who defeated Davey Richards in the finals of an eight-man tournament on March 5, 2010.<ref name=\"WOROHTVChamp\"/>\n\nThe current champion is Dragon Lee, who is in his first reign as champion.

These legends can be entertainment, but often concern mysterious peril or troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects. They may also be moralistic confirmation of prejudices or ways to make sense of societal anxieties.<ref>{{cite|title = Urban Legend Definition| publisher = Snopes.com| url = https://www.snopes.com/what-are-urban-legends/|ref = none}}</ref>\n\nUrban legends are most often circulated orally, but can be spread by any media, including newspapers, [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations.

Brunvand used his collection of legends, ''[[The Vanishing Hitchhiker|The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings]]'' (1981) to make two points: first, that [[legend]]s and [[folklore]] do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.\n\nMany urban legends are framed as complete [[fable|stories]] with [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Fictional character|characters]]. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], fear or humor. Often they serve as [[cautionary tale]]s.<ref name=\"Epoch\"/> Some urban legends are [[moral|morality tales]] that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.<ref name=\"Epoch\">{{cite news |title=Urban legends: Modern morality tales |author=Elissa Michele Zacher |newspaper=[[The Epoch Times]] |date=18 July 2010 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |accessdate=29 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140443/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nUrban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of [[disgust]] in the reader which tends to make these stories more memorable and potent.

These legends can be entertainment, but often concern mysterious peril or troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects. They may also be moralistic confirmation of prejudices or ways to make sense of societal anxieties.<ref>{{cite|title = Urban Legend Definition| publisher = Snopes.com| url = https://www.snopes.com/what-are-urban-legends/|ref = none}}</ref>\n\nUrban legends are most often circulated orally, but can be spread by any media, including newspapers, [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. Some urban legends have passed through the years with only minor changes to suit regional variations. Recent legends tend to reflect modern circumstances: for instance, the common legend of a person being ambushed and anesthetized, only to wake up and realize that they are now missing a kidney that was supposedly [[organ theft|surgically removed]] for [[organ transplant|transplantation]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/robbery/kidney.asp|title=snopes.com:Kidney Thief|website=[[Snopes|Urban Legends Reference Pages]]|date=12 March 2008|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and structure ==\nThe term \"urban legend,\" as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at least 1968.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed. 1989, entry for \"urban legend,\" citing R. M. Dorson in T. P. Coffin, ''Our Living Traditions'', xiv. 166 (1968). See also William B. Edgerton, ''The Ghost in Search of Help for a Dying Man'', Journal of the Folklore Institute, Vol. 5, No. 1. pp. 31, 38, 41 (1968).</ref> [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], professor of English at the [[University of Utah]], introduced the term to the general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, ''[[The Vanishing Hitchhiker|The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings]]'' (1981) to make two points: first, that [[legend]]s and [[folklore]] do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.\n\nMany urban legends are framed as complete [[fable|stories]] with [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[Fictional character|characters]]. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], fear or humor. Often they serve as [[cautionary tale]]s.<ref name=\"Epoch\"/> Some urban legends are [[moral|morality tales]] that depict someone, usually a child, acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.<ref name=\"Epoch\">{{cite news |title=Urban legends: Modern morality tales |author=Elissa Michele Zacher |newspaper=[[The Epoch Times]] |date=18 July 2010 |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |accessdate=29 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724140443/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39382/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nUrban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of [[disgust]] in the reader which tends to make these stories more memorable and potent.

While at least one classic legend, the \"Death Car\", has been shown to have some basis in fact,<ref>Richard Dorson. \"American Folklore\" University of Chicago Press, 1959, pp. 250-52.</ref> folklorists have an interest in debunking those narratives only to the degree that establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the tales are told, re-told and believed.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Adam Brooke Davis. \"[http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm Davis, Adam Brooke. \"Devil's Night and Hallowe'en: The Linked Fates of Two Folk Festivals.\" Missouri Folklore Society Journal XXIV(2002) 69-82] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160305105514/http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/Missouri%20Folklore%20Studies/devilsnight.htm |date= 2016-03-05 }}</ref> As in the case of [[myth]], the narratives are believed because they construct and reinforce the [[worldview]] of the group within which they are told, or \"because they provide us with coherent and convincing explanations of complex events\".<ref>John Mosier \"WAR MYTHS\" Historically Speaking: The Bulletin of the Historical Society: VI: 4, March/April 2005.</ref>\n\nSocial scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to help explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to [[crime]], [[childcare]], [[fast food]], [[SUVs]] and other \"family\" choices.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Croft |first= Robin |year= 2006 |title= Folklore, Families and Fear: Exploring the Influence of the Oral Tradition on Consumer Decision-making |journal= Journal of Marketing Management |volume= 22 |issue= 9 & 10 |pages= 1053\u20131076 |url= |doi= 10.1362/026725706778935574}}</ref> The authors make an explicit connection between urban legends and popular folklore, such as ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', where similar themes and motifs arise.

These stories usually revolve around someone seeing or encountering something of a supernatural caliber. These most well known type of these stories are known as [[List of cryptids|cryptid]] encounters. [[Cryptozoology|Cryptids]] are creatures that have no actual evidence in existing but have been claimed to be seen by a large number of people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptid|title=Definition of CRYPTID|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> The most notable cryptids include creatures such as [[Bigfoot]] or [[Mothman]].

2011 interview, she stated that, \"[swimming] really helped me get more fit and stronger, and helped me live a more independent life in a wheelchair.\" Swimming also allowed her to discover her competitive drive.<ref name=\":0\" /> While she had previously been first in her class academically, it was her introduction to the world of competitive racing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Sport==\nWhen she was eighteen, Pierre Pomerleau, a trainer at [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] in [[Quebec City]], introduced her to [[wheelchair]] sports. Using a homemade wheelchair, she took part in her first race and came last, well behind the other competitors. However, she had fallen in love with wheelchair racing and a long and fruitful career had begun.\n\nWhile Petitclerc was developing her skills as a wheelchair athlete, she pursued her studies, first in [[social sciences]] at the [[CEGEP de Sainte-Foy]] and then in history at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton, where she registered in order to be able to train with [[Peter Eriksson (coach)|Peter Eriksson]], who remains her coach to this day.\n\nPetitclerc competed in the [[Paralympic Games]] for the first time in [[Barcelona]] in [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992]], returning with two bronze medals, the start of collection that now includes twenty one Paralympic medals, fourteen of them gold. Four years later, at the [[1996 Summer Paralympics|Atlanta games]], she took gold medals in the 100 and 200 m events and three silvers in the 400, 800, and 1500 m races. At the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], she won two golds, in the 200 m and 800 m, and two silvers, in the 100 m and 400 m races. She won three gold medals (in 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m, and 400&nbsp;m) and a bronze (800&nbsp;m) at the 2002 World Championships and a gold at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in the 800&nbsp;m. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] (where wheelchair racing was an exhibition sport) she won the 800&nbsp;m, and went on to an impressive showing with 5 gold medals at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]]. When she returned from Athens in 2004, Petitclerc told reporters the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Beijing]] would be her last big international meeting but that she will continue training and road racing for a while.

2011 interview, she stated that, \"[swimming] really helped me get more fit and stronger, and helped me live a more independent life in a wheelchair.\" Swimming also allowed her to discover her competitive drive.<ref name=\":0\" /> While she had previously been first in her class academically, it was her introduction to the world of competitive racing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Sport==\nWhen she was eighteen, Pierre Pomerleau, a trainer at [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]] in [[Quebec City]], introduced her to [[wheelchair]] sports. Using a homemade wheelchair, she took part in her first race and came last, well behind the other competitors. However, she had fallen in love with wheelchair racing and a long and fruitful career had begun.\n\nWhile Petitclerc was developing her skills as a wheelchair athlete, she pursued her studies, first in [[social sciences]] at the [[CEGEP de Sainte-Foy]] and then in history at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton, where she registered in order to be able to train with [[Peter Eriksson (coach)|Peter Eriksson]], who remains her coach to this day.\n\nPetitclerc competed in the [[Paralympic Games]] for the first time in [[Barcelona]] in [[1992 Summer Paralympics|1992]], returning with two bronze medals, the start of collection that now includes twenty one Paralympic medals, fourteen of them gold. Four years later, at the [[1996 Summer Paralympics|Atlanta games]], she took gold medals in the 100 and 200 m events and three silvers in the 400, 800, and 1500 m races. At the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], she won two golds, in the 200 m and 800 m, and two silvers, in the 100 m and 400 m races. She won three gold medals (in 100&nbsp;m, 200&nbsp;m, and 400&nbsp;m) and a bronze (800&nbsp;m) at the 2002 World Championships and a gold at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in the 800&nbsp;m. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] (where wheelchair racing was an exhibition sport) she won the 800&nbsp;m, and went on to an impressive showing with 5 gold medals at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]]. When she returned from Athens in 2004, Petitclerc told reporters the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Beijing]] would be her last big international meeting but that she will continue training and road racing for a while.
