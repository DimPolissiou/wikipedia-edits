An ardent believer in British [[imperialism]], Rhodes and his [[British South Africa Company]] founded the southern African territory of [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), which the company named after him in 1895. South Africa's [[Rhodes University]] is also named after him.  Rhodes set up the provisions of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which is funded by his estate. He also put much effort towards his vision of a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]] through British territory.{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe son of a [[vicar]], Rhodes was born at [[Rhodes Arts Complex|Netteswell House]], [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire. Growing up in Hertfordshire, he was a sickly child.  He was sent to South Africa by his family when he was 17 years old in the hope that the climate might improve his health.  He entered the diamond trade at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1871, when he was 18, and over the next two decades gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market.  His [[De Beers]] diamond company, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century. Rhodes entered the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] at the age of 27 in 1880, and a decade later became Prime Minister. After overseeing the formation of Rhodesia during the early 1890s, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in 1896 after the disastrous [[Jameson Raid]], an unauthorised attack on [[Paul Kruger]]'s [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal).\n\nOne of Rhodes's primary motivations in politics and business was his professed belief that the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon race]] was, to quote his [[Will and testament|will]], \"the first race in the world\".{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} Under the reasoning that \"the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race\",{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} he advocated vigorous [[settler colonialism]] and ultimately a reformation of the [[British Empire]] so that each component would be self-governing and [[Imperial Federation|represented in a single parliament]] in London.  Ambitions such as these, juxtaposed with his policies regarding indigenous Africans in the Cape Colony\u2014describing the country's native black population as largely \"in a state of barbarism\",{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}} he advocated their governance as a \"subject race\",{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}} and was at the centre of actions to marginalise them politically\u2014have led recent critics to characterise him as a white supremacist and \"an architect of [[apartheid]]\".{{sfn|Castle|2016}}\n\nHistorian Richard A.

The land was unsuitable for cotton, and the venture failed.\n\nIn October 1871, 18-year-old Rhodes and his 26-year-old brother Herbert left the colony for the diamond fields of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in Northern Cape Province. Financed by [[N M Rothschild & Sons]], Rhodes succeeded over the next 17 years in buying up all the smaller diamond mining operations in the Kimberley area.\n\nHis monopoly of the world's diamond supply was sealed in 1890 through a strategic partnership with the London-based Diamond Syndicate. They agreed to control world supply to maintain high prices.{{sfn|Epstein|1982|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Knowles|2005|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Rhodes supervised the working of his brother's claim and [[speculation|speculated]] on his behalf. Among his associates in the early days were [[John X. Merriman]] and [[Charles Rudd]], who later became his partner in the [[De Beers|De Beers Mining Company]] and the Niger Oil Company.\n\nDuring the 1880s, [[Boschendal|Cape vineyards]] had been devastated by a [[phylloxera]] epidemic. The diseased vineyards were dug up and replanted, and farmers were looking for alternatives to wine. In 1892, Rhodes financed The [[Pioneer Fruit Growing Company]] at [[Nooitgedacht, South Africa|Nooitgedacht]], a venture created by Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience with fruit-growing in California.{{sfn|Boschendal|2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}  The shipping magnate [[Percy Molteno]] had just undertaken the first successful refrigerated export to Europe.

He was admitted to [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but stayed for only one term in 1873. He returned to South Africa and did not return for his second term at Oxford until 1876. He was greatly influenced by [[John Ruskin]]'s inaugural lecture at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British [[imperialism]].\n\nAmong his Oxford associates were [[James Rochfort Maguire]], later a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] and a director of the [[British South Africa Company]], and Charles Metcalfe {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

Before his departure for Oxford, he and C.D. Rudd had moved from the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] to invest in the more costly claims of what was known as old De Beers (''Vooruitzicht''). It was named after Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and his brother, Diederik Arnoldus, who occupied the farm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetowndiamondmuseum.org/about-diamonds/famous-people/|title=FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY|publisher=Cape Town Diamond Museum|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing the land in 1839 from David Danser, a [[Griqua people|Koranna]] chief in the area, David Stephanus Fourie, forebearer for Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor, had allowed the de Beers and various other Afrikaner families to cultivate the land.

They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard [[Kimberlite|blue ground]] that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had been worked out. During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious. Rhodes and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping water out of the three main mines. After Rhodes returned from his first term at Oxford, he lived with Robert Dundas Graham, who later became a mining partner with Rudd and Rhodes.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=76-}}\n\nOn 13 March 1888, Rhodes and Rudd launched [[De Beers Consolidated Mines]] after the amalgamation of a number of individual claims. With \u00a3200,000 of capital, the company, of which Rhodes was secretary, owned the largest interest in the mine (\u00a3200,000 in 1880 = \u00a312.9m in 2004 = $22.5m USD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/ |title=Purchasing Power of Pound |publisher=Measuring Worth |date=15 February 1971 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> Rhodes was named the chairman of [[De Beers]] at the company's founding in 1888.

With the earlier incorporation of [[Griqualand West]] into the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] under the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno Ministry]] in 1877, the area had obtained six seats in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape House of Assembly]].

The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the [[Basotho]] nation, who resisted.\n\nIn 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. He introduced the [[Glen Grey Act]] to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development. Rhodes's view was that black people needed to be driven off their land to \"stimulate them to labour\" and to change their habits.{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}} \"It must be brought home to them\", Rhodes said, \"that in future nine-tenths of them will have to spend their lives in manual labour, and the sooner that is brought home to them the better.\"{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}}\n\nGiven the growing number of enfranchised black people in the Cape, Rhodes raised the franchise property requirements in 1892 to counter this preponderance.

Rhodes' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts, also called the \"imperial factor\", as he often collaborated with the British Government. He befriended its local representatives, the British [[Commissioner]]s, and through them organised British [[protectorate]]s over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties. In this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations. He could then attract more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe imperial factor was a double-edged sword: Rhodes did not want the [[bureaucrat]]s of the [[Colonial Office]] in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him on a collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British [[missionaries]], who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[Germany|Germans]] or the [[Boers]] from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes's companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\n=== Treaties, concessions and charters ===\n\nRhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from [[Lobengula]], king of the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] of [[Matabeleland]]. In 1888 he tried again. He sent [[John Smith Moffat|John Moffat]], son of the missionary [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes's proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the [[Rudd Concession]], which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nDuring the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions (hundreds of millions in current pounds) over the coming years through what has been described as a \"''[[:wiktionary:suppressio veri|suppressio veri]]''&nbsp;... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions\".{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}} Contrary to what the British government and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and a few others called the ''Central Search Association'', which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the ''United Concessions Company'' in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] [[Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford|Knutsford]] to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}}\n\nArmed with the Rudd Concession, in 1889 Rhodes obtained a [[charter]] from the British Government for his [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) to rule, police, and make new treaties and concessions from the [[Limpopo River]] to the great lakes of Central Africa. He obtained further concessions and treaties north of the [[Zambezi]], such as those in [[Barotseland]] (the Lochner Concession with King ''[[Lewanika]]'' in 1890, which was similar to the Rudd Concession); and in the [[Lake Mweru]] area ([[Alfred Sharpe]]'s 1890 [[Kazembe]] concession). Rhodes also sent Sharpe to get a concession over mineral-rich [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], but met his match in ruthlessness: when Sharpe was rebuffed by its ruler ''[[Msiri]]'', King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] obtained a concession over Msiri's dead body for his [[Congo Free State]].{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nRhodes also wanted [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] (now [[Botswana]]) incorporated in the BSAC charter. But three [[Tswana people|Tswana]] kings, including [[Khama III]], travelled to Britain and won over British public opinion for it to remain governed by the British Colonial Office in London. Rhodes commented: \"It is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers.\"{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nThe British [[Colonial Office]] also decided to administer [[British Central Africa]] ([[Malawi|Nyasaland, today's Malawi]]) owing to{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} the activism of [[David Livingstone]] trying to end the  [[Arab slave trade|East African Arab-Swahili slave trade]]. Rhodes paid much of the cost so that the British Central Africa Commissioner [[Sir Harry Johnston]], and his successor Alfred Sharpe, would assist with security for Rhodes in the BSAC's north-eastern territories. Johnston shared Rhodes's expansionist views, but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as Rhodes, and disagreed on dealings with Africans.\n\n=== Rhodesia ===\n{{main|Company rule in Rhodesia}}\n[[File:Rhodes matabele 1896.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Rhodes and the Ndebele ''izinDuna'' make peace in the [[Matopos Hills]], as depicted by [[Robert Baden-Powell]], 1896]]\nThe BSAC had its own police force, the [[British South Africa Police]], which was used to control [[Matabeleland]] and [[Mashonaland]], in present-day [[Zimbabwe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The company had hoped to start a \"new [[Witwatersrand|Rand]]\" from the ancient gold mines of the ''[[Shona people|Shona]]''.

Shortly after learning of the assassination of the Ndebele spiritual leader, ''Mlimo'', by the American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in [[Matobo Hills]].{{sfn|Panton|2015|p=321}} He persuaded the ''[[Impi]]'' to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.{{sfn|Farwell|2001|pp=539\u2013}}\n\nBy the end of 1894, the territories over which the BSAC had concessions or treaties, collectively called \"Zambesia\" after the [[Zambezi River]] flowing through the middle, comprised an area of 1,143,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> between the [[Limpopo River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. In May 1895, its name was officially changed to \"Rhodesia\", reflecting Rhodes's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891. The designation [[Southern Rhodesia]] was officially adopted in 1898 for the part south of the Zambezi, which later became Zimbabwe; and the designations [[North-Western Rhodesia|North-Western]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] were used from 1895 for the territory which later became [[Northern Rhodesia]], then [[Zambia]].{{sfn|Gray|1956}}{{sfn|Gray|1954}}\n\nRhodes decreed in his will that he was to be buried in Matopos Hills (now Matobo Hills).

We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa\".{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=108}} Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony \"in a state of barbarism and communal tenure\" as \"a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote.&nbsp;... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.\"{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}}\n\nHowever historian Raymond C. Mensing, notes that Rhodes has the reputation  as the most flamboyant exemplar of the British imperial spirit, and always believed that British institutions were the best. Mensing argues that Rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in Africa and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic. According to {{harvnb|Mensing|1986|pp=99\u2013106}} and front page, \"Rhodes was not a [[Scientific racism|biological or maximal racist]]. Despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system, he is best seen as a [[Cultural racism|cultural or minimal racist]]\".\n\nOn domestic politics within Britain, Rhodes was a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Pinney|1995|p=72}} Rhodes' only major impact was his large-scale support of the Irish nationalist party, led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846\u20131891).{{sfn|McCracken|2003|pp=22-24}}\n\nRhodes worked well with the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony. He supported teaching Dutch as well as English in public schools. While Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, he helped to remove most of their legal disabilities. {{sfn|Flint|2009}} He was a friend of [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|Jan Hofmeyr]], leader of the [[Afrikaner Bond]], and it was largely because of Afrikaner support that he became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} Rhodes advocated greater self-government for the Cape Colony, in line with his preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by London.\n\nScholar and Zimbabwean author [[Peter Godwin]], whilst critical of Rhodes, writes that he needs to be viewed via the prisms and cultural and social perspective of his epoch, positing that Rhodes \"was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time...Rhodes and the white pioneers in southern Africa did behave despicably by today's standards, but no worse than the white settlers in North America, South America, and Australia; and in some senses better, considering that the genocide of natives in Africa was less complete. For all the former African colonies are now ruled by indigenous peoples, unlike the Americas and the Antipodes, most of whose aboriginal natives were all but exterminated.\"\n\nGodwin goes on to say \"Rhodes and his cronies fit in perfectly with their surroundings and conformed to the morality (or lack of it) of the day. As is so often the case, history simply followed the gravitational pull of superior firepower.\"\n\n== Personal relationships ==\n\n=== Personal life ===\nRhodes never married, pleading, \"I have too much work on my hands\" and saying that he would not be a dutiful husband.{{sfn|Plomer|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Subsequent historians such as Robin Brown have suggested that Rhodes was a homosexual who was in love with his private secretary, Neville Pickering. Rhodes made Pickering the sole beneficiary of his will, but an accident resulted in Pickering catching septicaemia, during which time Rhodes spent six weeks trying to nurse Pickering back to health. Pickering eventually died in Rhodes' arms.<ref>http://thecasualobserver.co.za/rhodes-enigma-close-male-personal-relationships/</ref><ref>https://city-press.news24.com/Voices/Rhodes-and-his-sexuality-20151106</ref><ref>Robin Brown, ''The Secret Society: Cecil John Rhodes' Plan for a New World Order'' (Penguin: 2015).</ref><ref>https://showme.co.za/lifestyle/the-secret-rhodes/</ref>\n\n=== Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 ===\n\nIn the last years of his life, Rhodes was [[stalking|stalked]] by Polish princess [[Catherine Radziwill|Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], born [[Rzewuski family|Rzewuska]], who had married into the [[szlachta|noble]] Polish family [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. The princess falsely claimed that she was engaged to Rhodes, and that they were having an affair. She asked him to marry her, but Rhodes refused. In reaction, she accused him of loan [[fraud]].

The military felt he was more of a liability than an asset and found him intolerable. The officer commanding the garrison of Kimberley, Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], experienced serious personal difficulties with Rhodes because of the latters' inability to co-operate;{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=321\u2013323}}{{sfn|Phelan|1913|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDespite these differences, Rhodes's company was instrumental in the defence of the city, providing water, refrigeration facilities, constructing fortifications, manufacturing an [[armoured train]], shells and a one-off gun named [[Long Cecil]].{{sfn|Roberts|1976|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nRhodes used his position and influence to lobby the British government to relieve the siege of Kimberley, claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate. The military wanted to assemble a large force to take the Boer cities of [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Pretoria]], but they were compelled to change their plans and send three separate smaller forces to relieve the sieges of Kimberley, [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]] and [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]].{{sfn|Thompson|2007|pp=131\u2013}}\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\n[[File:Cecil Rhodes funeral.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral of Rhodes in Adderley St, Cape Town, on 3 April 1902]]\nAlthough Rhodes remained a leading figure in the politics of southern Africa, especially during the [[Second Boer War]], he was dogged by ill health throughout his relatively short life.\n\nHe was sent to Natal aged 16 because it was believed the climate might help problems with his heart. On returning to England in 1872, his health again deteriorated with heart and lung problems, to the extent that his doctor, Sir [[Morell Mackenzie]], believed he would only survive six months. He returned to Kimberley where his health improved. From age 40 his heart condition returned with increasing severity until his death from heart failure in 1902, aged 48, at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.{{sfn|The Times|27 March 1902}}\n\nThe government arranged an epic journey by train from the Cape to Rhodesia, with the funeral train stopping at every station to allow mourners to pay their respects. It was reported that at Kimberley, \"practically the entire population marched in procession past the funeral car\".<ref>Mr. Rhodes's Bequests,New-York Tribune, 6 April 1902, Page 4</ref> He was finally laid to rest at World's View, a hilltop located approximately {{convert|35|km|mi}} south of [[Bulawayo]], in what was then [[Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=848}} Today, his grave site is part of [[Matobo National Park]], Zimbabwe.\n\nThe continued presence of Rhodes's grave in the Matopos (now Matobos) hills has not been without controversy in contemporary Zimbabwe. In December 2010, [[Cain Mathema]], the governor of Bulawayo, branded the grave outside the country's second city an \"insult to the African ancestors\" and said he believed its presence had brought bad luck and poor weather to the region. The grave site is considered an important national and historic monument on protected land which attracts many tourist visitors every year.{{sfn|Gore|2013}}\n\nIn February 2012, Mugabe loyalists and [[ZANU-PF]] activists visited the grave site demanding permission from the local chief to exhume Rhodes's remains and return them to Britain. This was considered a nationalist political stunt in the run up to an election, rather than representing any genuine national desire to remove the grave. Local Chief Masuku and Godfrey Mahachi, one of the country's foremost archaeologists, strongly expressed their opposition to the grave being removed due to its historical significance to Zimbabwe. Then-president [[Robert Mugabe]] also opposed the move.{{sfn|Laing|2012}}\n\nIn 2004, he was voted 56th in the [[SABC 3]] television series ''[[Great South Africans (television series)|Great South Africans]]''.{{sfn|Blair|2004}}\n\nAt his death, he was considered one of the wealthiest men in the world.

When asked if there was any double standard or hypocrisy in being funded by the Rhodes Scholarship fund and benefiting from the opportunity, whilst at the same time, campaigning against the legacy of Rhodes, one of the South African campaigners, [[Ntokozo Qwabe]], replied that \"this scholarship does not buy our silence...There is no hypocrisy in being a recipient of a Rhodes scholarship and being publicly critical of Cecil Rhodes and his legacy...

Its members eventually achieve the secret of time travel and use it to restrain World War I and prevent World War II, and to perpetuate the world ascendancy of the British Empire up to the end of the Twentieth Century. The book contains a vivid description of Cecil Rhodes himself, seen through the eyes of a traveller from the future British Empire.\n* In the British film ''[[Rhodes of Africa]]'' (1936, directed by Austrian filmmaker [[Berthold Viertel]]), Rhodes was portrayed by Canadian actor [[Walter Huston]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028176/ ''Rhodes of Africa'' (1936)].</ref>\n* Rhodes was played by [[Ferdinand Marian (actor)|Ferdinand Marian]] in the Nazi propaganda film ''[[Ohm Kr\u00fcger]]'' (1941), where he \u2013 like all other British characters in the film \u2013 was presented as an outright villain.\n* In 1901, Rhodes bought [[Dalham Hall]], Suffolk. In 1902, Colonel [[Frank Rhodes (British Army officer)|Frank Rhodes]] erected the village hall{{sfn|Dalham}} in the village of [[Dalham]], near [[Bury St Edmunds]], to commemorate the life of his brother, who had died before taking possession of the estate.\n* Rhodes was a peripheral but influential character in the historical novel ''[[The Covenant (novel)|The Covenant]]'' by [[James Michener]].\n* His memorial at Devil's Peak also served as a temple in ''[[The Adventures of Sinbad]]'' episode \"The Return of the Ronin\".\n* The 1976 [[Hugh Masekela]] album ''[[Colonial Man]]'' has a song  titled \"Cecil Rhodes\".\n* In 1996, BBC-TV made an eight-part television drama about Rhodes called ''[[Rhodes (TV series)|Rhodes: The Life and Legend of Cecil Rhodes]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115335/ \"Rhodes\" on IMDB]</ref> It was produced by David Drury and written by Antony Thomas. It tells the story of Rhodes' life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by [[Martin Shaw]], the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 is played by [[Frances Barber]]. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual.{{sfn|Godwin|1998}} Countering the implication of Rhodes' homosexuality, historian and journalist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote that Rhodes had been falsely smeared by the programme, commenting: \"In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent \u00a310m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.\" [[Peter Godwin]] said of the film that \"it feels like a work overwhelmingly informed by malice, consistently seizing on the very worst interpretation of the man without really attempting to get under his skin. Rhodes was no 19th-century Hitler.

British businessman, mining [[magnate]] and [[politician]] in southern Africa who served as [[Prime Minister of the Cape Colony|Prime Minister]] of the [[Cape Colony]] from 1890 to 1896.  An ardent believer in British [[imperialism]], Rhodes and his [[British South Africa Company]] founded the southern African territory of [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), which the company named after him in 1895. South Africa's [[Rhodes University]] is also named after him.  Rhodes set up the provisions of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which is funded by his estate. He also put much effort towards his vision of a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]] through British territory.{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe son of a [[vicar]], Rhodes was born at [[Rhodes Arts Complex|Netteswell House]], [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire. Growing up in Hertfordshire, he was a sickly child.  He was sent to South Africa by his family when he was 17 years old in the hope that the climate might improve his health.  He entered the diamond trade at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1871, when he was 18, and over the next two decades gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market.  His [[De Beers]] diamond company, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century. Rhodes entered the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] at the age of 27 in 1880, and a decade later became Prime Minister. After overseeing the formation of Rhodesia during the early 1890s, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in 1896 after the disastrous [[Jameson Raid]], an unauthorised attack on [[Paul Kruger]]'s [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal).\n\nOne of Rhodes's primary motivations in politics and business was his professed belief that the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon race]] was, to quote his [[Will and testament|will]], \"the first race in the world\".{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} Under the reasoning that \"the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race\",{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} he advocated vigorous [[settler colonialism]] and ultimately a reformation of the [[British Empire]] so that each component would be self-governing and [[Imperial Federation|represented in a single parliament]] in London.  Ambitions such as these, juxtaposed with his policies regarding indigenous Africans in the Cape Colony\u2014describing the country's native black population as largely \"in a state of barbarism\",{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}} he advocated their governance as a \"subject race\",{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}} and was at the centre of actions to marginalise them politically\u2014have led recent critics to characterise him as a white supremacist and \"an architect of [[apartheid]]\".{{sfn|Castle|2016}}\n\nHistorian Richard A. McFarlane has described Rhodes \"as integral a participant in southern African and British imperial history as [[George Washington]] or [[Abraham Lincoln]] are in their respective eras in United States history.\"{{sfn|McFarlane|2007}} After Rhodes's death in 1902, at the age of 48, he was buried in the [[Matopos Hills]] in what is now Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/9098490/Robert-Mugabe-blocks-Cecil-John-Rhodes-exhumation.html|title=Robert Mugabe blocks Cecil John Rhodes exhumation|newspaper=Telegraph|author=Aislinn Laing}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nRhodes was born in 1853 in [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire, England, the fifth son of the Reverend Francis William Rhodes (1807-1878) and his wife Louisa Peacock.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/cecil-john-rhodes|title=Cecil John Rhodes|publisher =South African History Online|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Francis was a [[Church of England]] [[clergyman]] who served as [[perpetual curate]] of Brentwood, Essex (1834-1843) and then as vicar of nearby Bishops Stortford (1849-1876).

Sutherland]], in [[Pietermaritzburg]], Rhodes took an interest in agriculture. He joined his brother Herbert on his cotton farm in the [[Umkomazi]] valley in Natal. The land was unsuitable for cotton, and the venture failed.\n\nIn October 1871, 18-year-old Rhodes and his 26-year-old brother Herbert left the colony for the diamond fields of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in Northern Cape Province. Financed by [[N M Rothschild & Sons]], Rhodes succeeded over the next 17 years in buying up all the smaller diamond mining operations in the Kimberley area.\n\nHis monopoly of the world's diamond supply was sealed in 1890 through a strategic partnership with the London-based Diamond Syndicate. They agreed to control world supply to maintain high prices.{{sfn|Epstein|1982|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Knowles|2005|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Rhodes supervised the working of his brother's claim and [[speculation|speculated]] on his behalf. Among his associates in the early days were [[John X. Merriman]] and [[Charles Rudd]], who later became his partner in the [[De Beers|De Beers Mining Company]] and the Niger Oil Company.\n\nDuring the 1880s, [[Boschendal|Cape vineyards]] had been devastated by a [[phylloxera]] epidemic. The diseased vineyards were dug up and replanted, and farmers were looking for alternatives to wine. In 1892, Rhodes financed The [[Pioneer Fruit Growing Company]] at [[Nooitgedacht, South Africa|Nooitgedacht]], a venture created by Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience with fruit-growing in California.{{sfn|Boschendal|2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}  The shipping magnate [[Percy Molteno]] had just undertaken the first successful refrigerated export to Europe. In 1896, after consulting with Molteno, Rhodes began to pay more attention to export fruit farming and bought farms in Groot Drakenstein, [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]] and Stellenbosch. A year later, he bought Rhone and [[Boschendal]] and commissioned [[Sir Herbert Baker]] to build him a cottage there.{{sfn|Boschendal|2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Picton-Seymour|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}  The successful operation soon expanded into [[Rhodes Fruit Farms]], and formed a cornerstone of the modern-day Cape fruit industry.{{sfn| Oberholster |1987|p=91}}\n\n=== Education ===\n\n[[File:Rhodes' portrait bust.JPG|thumb|A portrait bust of Rhodes on the first floor of No. 6 [[King Edward Street]] marks the place of his residence whilst in [[Oxford]].]]\n\nIn 1873, Rhodes left his farm field in the care of his business partner, Rudd, and sailed for England to study at university. He was admitted to [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but stayed for only one term in 1873. He returned to South Africa and did not return for his second term at Oxford until 1876. He was greatly influenced by [[John Ruskin]]'s inaugural lecture at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British [[imperialism]].\n\nAmong his Oxford associates were [[James Rochfort Maguire]], later a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] and a director of the [[British South Africa Company]], and Charles Metcalfe {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Due to his university career, Rhodes admired the Oxford \"system\". Eventually, he was inspired to develop his scholarship scheme: \"Wherever you turn your eye\u2014except in science\u2014an Oxford man is at the top of the tree\".{{sfn|Alexander|1914|p=259}}\n\nWhile attending Oriel College, Rhodes became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in the [[Apollo University Lodge]].{{sfn|Apollo University Lodge}} Although initially he did not approve of the organisation, he continued to be a [[Freemasonry in South Africa|South African Freemason]] until his death in 1902. The shortcomings of the Freemasons, in his opinion, later caused him to envisage his own secret society with the goal of bringing the entire world under British rule.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to [[Carroll Quigley]], he set up the [[Round Table movement]] to this end.\n\n== Diamonds and the establishment of De Beers ==\n[[File:De Beers Consolidated Mines 1902.jpg|thumb|Preference Share of the De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., issued 1. March 1902]]\n[[File:Cecil Rhodes by Violet manners.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Rhodes by [[Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland|Violet Manners]] ]]\n\nDuring his years at Oxford, Rhodes continued to prosper in Kimberley. Before his departure for Oxford, he and C.D. Rudd had moved from the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] to invest in the more costly claims of what was known as old De Beers (''Vooruitzicht''). It was named after Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and his brother, Diederik Arnoldus, who occupied the farm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetowndiamondmuseum.org/about-diamonds/famous-people/|title=FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY|publisher=Cape Town Diamond Museum|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing the land in 1839 from David Danser, a [[Griqua people|Koranna]] chief in the area, David Stephanus Fourie, forebearer for Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor, had allowed the de Beers and various other Afrikaner families to cultivate the land. The region extended from the [[Modder River]] via the Vet River up to the [[Vaal River]].{{sfn|Rosenthal|1965|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1874 and 1875, the diamond fields were in the grip of depression, but Rhodes and Rudd were among those who stayed to consolidate their interests. They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard [[Kimberlite|blue ground]] that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had been worked out. During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious. Rhodes and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping water out of the three main mines. After Rhodes returned from his first term at Oxford, he lived with Robert Dundas Graham, who later became a mining partner with Rudd and Rhodes.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=76-}}\n\nOn 13 March 1888, Rhodes and Rudd launched [[De Beers Consolidated Mines]] after the amalgamation of a number of individual claims. With \u00a3200,000 of capital, the company, of which Rhodes was secretary, owned the largest interest in the mine (\u00a3200,000 in 1880 = \u00a312.9m in 2004 = $22.5m USD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/ |title=Purchasing Power of Pound |publisher=Measuring Worth |date=15 February 1971 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> Rhodes was named the chairman of [[De Beers]] at the company's founding in 1888. De Beers was established with funding from [[Rothschild & Co|N.M.

With the earlier incorporation of [[Griqualand West]] into the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] under the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno Ministry]] in 1877, the area had obtained six seats in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape House of Assembly]]. Rhodes chose the rural and predominately [[Boer]] constituency of [[Barkly West]], which would remain loyal to Rhodes until his death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cecil-Rhodes|title=Cecil Rhodes {{!}} prime minister of Cape Colony|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen Rhodes became a member of the [[Cape Parliament]], the chief goal of the assembly was to help decide the future of [[Basutoland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The ministry of [[Gordon Sprigg|Sir Gordon Sprigg]] was trying to restore order after the 1880 rebellion known as the [[Gun War]]. The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the [[Basotho]] nation, who resisted.\n\nIn 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. He introduced the [[Glen Grey Act]] to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development. Rhodes's view was that black people needed to be driven off their land to \"stimulate them to labour\" and to change their habits.{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}} \"It must be brought home to them\", Rhodes said, \"that in future nine-tenths of them will have to spend their lives in manual labour, and the sooner that is brought home to them the better.\"{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}}\n\nGiven the growing number of enfranchised black people in the Cape, Rhodes raised the franchise property requirements in 1892 to counter this preponderance. The change had drastic effects on the traditional [[Cape Qualified Franchise]].<ref>[http://myfundi.co.za/e/History_of_South_Africa_Timeline_%281485-1975%29 History of South Africa Timeline(1485\u20131975)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913230535/http://myfundi.co.za/e/History_of_South_Africa_Timeline_%281485-1975%29 |date=13 September 2011 }}</ref> By simultaneously limiting the amount of land which black Africans were legally allowed to hold, while tripling the property qualifications required to vote, Rhodes succeeded in disenfranchising the black population.

It forced Cecil Rhodes to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, sent his oldest brother Col.

Burrows was severely wounded and had to have his leg amputated. His suit for \u00a33,000 in damages was successful.<ref>''Burrows v.

Rhodes' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts, also called the \"imperial factor\", as he often collaborated with the British Government. He befriended its local representatives, the British [[Commissioner]]s, and through them organised British [[protectorate]]s over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties. In this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations. He could then attract more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe imperial factor was a double-edged sword: Rhodes did not want the [[bureaucrat]]s of the [[Colonial Office]] in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him on a collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British [[missionaries]], who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[Germany|Germans]] or the [[Boers]] from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes's companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\n=== Treaties, concessions and charters ===\n\nRhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from [[Lobengula]], king of the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] of [[Matabeleland]]. In 1888 he tried again. He sent [[John Smith Moffat|John Moffat]], son of the missionary [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes's proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the [[Rudd Concession]], which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nDuring the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions (hundreds of millions in current pounds) over the coming years through what has been described as a \"''[[:wiktionary:suppressio veri|suppressio veri]]''&nbsp;... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions\".{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}} Contrary to what the British government and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and a few others called the ''Central Search Association'', which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the ''United Concessions Company'' in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] [[Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford|Knutsford]] to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}}\n\nArmed with the Rudd Concession, in 1889 Rhodes obtained a [[charter]] from the British Government for his [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) to rule, police, and make new treaties and concessions from the [[Limpopo River]] to the great lakes of Central Africa. He obtained further concessions and treaties north of the [[Zambezi]], such as those in [[Barotseland]] (the Lochner Concession with King ''[[Lewanika]]'' in 1890, which was similar to the Rudd Concession); and in the [[Lake Mweru]] area ([[Alfred Sharpe]]'s 1890 [[Kazembe]] concession). Rhodes also sent Sharpe to get a concession over mineral-rich [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], but met his match in ruthlessness: when Sharpe was rebuffed by its ruler ''[[Msiri]]'', King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] obtained a concession over Msiri's dead body for his [[Congo Free State]].{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nRhodes also wanted [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] (now [[Botswana]]) incorporated in the BSAC charter. But three [[Tswana people|Tswana]] kings, including [[Khama III]], travelled to Britain and won over British public opinion for it to remain governed by the British Colonial Office in London. Rhodes commented: \"It is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers.\"{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nThe British [[Colonial Office]] also decided to administer [[British Central Africa]] ([[Malawi|Nyasaland, today's Malawi]]) owing to{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} the activism of [[David Livingstone]] trying to end the  [[Arab slave trade|East African Arab-Swahili slave trade]]. Rhodes paid much of the cost so that the British Central Africa Commissioner [[Sir Harry Johnston]], and his successor Alfred Sharpe, would assist with security for Rhodes in the BSAC's north-eastern territories. Johnston shared Rhodes's expansionist views, but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as Rhodes, and disagreed on dealings with Africans.\n\n=== Rhodesia ===\n{{main|Company rule in Rhodesia}}\n[[File:Rhodes matabele 1896.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Rhodes and the Ndebele ''izinDuna'' make peace in the [[Matopos Hills]], as depicted by [[Robert Baden-Powell]], 1896]]\nThe BSAC had its own police force, the [[British South Africa Police]], which was used to control [[Matabeleland]] and [[Mashonaland]], in present-day [[Zimbabwe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The company had hoped to start a \"new [[Witwatersrand|Rand]]\" from the ancient gold mines of the ''[[Shona people|Shona]]''.

Shortly after learning of the assassination of the Ndebele spiritual leader, ''Mlimo'', by the American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in [[Matobo Hills]].{{sfn|Panton|2015|p=321}} He persuaded the ''[[Impi]]'' to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.{{sfn|Farwell|2001|pp=539\u2013}}\n\nBy the end of 1894, the territories over which the BSAC had concessions or treaties, collectively called \"Zambesia\" after the [[Zambezi River]] flowing through the middle, comprised an area of 1,143,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> between the [[Limpopo River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. In May 1895, its name was officially changed to \"Rhodesia\", reflecting Rhodes's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891. The designation [[Southern Rhodesia]] was officially adopted in 1898 for the part south of the Zambezi, which later became Zimbabwe; and the designations [[North-Western Rhodesia|North-Western]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] were used from 1895 for the territory which later became [[Northern Rhodesia]], then [[Zambia]].{{sfn|Gray|1956}}{{sfn|Gray|1954}}\n\nRhodes decreed in his will that he was to be buried in Matopos Hills (now Matobo Hills). After his death in the Cape in 1902, his body was transported by train to [[Bulawayo]]. His burial was attended by Ndebele chiefs, who asked that the firing party should not discharge their rifles as this would disturb the spirits. Then, for the first time, they gave a white man the Matabele royal salute, ''Bayete''. Rhodes is buried alongside [[Leander Starr Jameson]] and 34 British soldiers killed in the [[Shangani Patrol]].{{sfn|Domville-Fife|1900 |p=89}} Despite occasional efforts to return his body to the United Kingdom, his grave remains there still, \"part and parcel of the history of Zimbabwe\" and attracts thousands of visitors each year.{{sfn|Laing|2012}}\n\n=== \"Cape to Cairo Red Line\" ===\n\n[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|right|upright|Map showing almost complete British control of the Cape to Cairo route, 1913<br />{{Legend|#fbc5c0|British control}}]]\n{{main|Cape to Cairo Railway|Cape to Cairo Road}}\n\nOne of Rhodes's dreams (shared by other members of the [[British Empire]]) was for a \"red line\" on the map from the Cape to Cairo (on geo-political maps, British dominions were always denoted in red or pink). Rhodes had been instrumental in securing southern African states for the Empire. He and others felt the best way to \"unify the possessions, facilitate governance, enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or conduct war, help settlement, and foster trade\" would be to build the \"[[Cape to Cairo Railway]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/travel/an-african-journey-from-the-cape-to-cairo.html|title=AN AFRICAN JOURNEY, FROM THE CAPE TO CAIRO|newspaper=New York Times|author=Barbara Crossette|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis enterprise was not without its problems.

In his last will and testament, Rhodes said of the English, \"I contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race. I contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the English race who otherwise would not be brought into existence.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} These views struck a chord with [[Adolf Hitler]], who claimed that Rhodes was the only Englishman who truly understood Anglo-Saxon ideals.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bbc-unveils-a-victorian-hero-a-money-mad-racist-closet-gay-1330823.html</ref>\n\nRhodes wanted to make the British Empire a superpower in which all of the British-dominated countries in the empire, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Cape Colony, would be [[Imperial Federation|represented in the British Parliament]].{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|p=150}} Rhodes included American students as eligible for the Rhodes scholarships. He said that he wanted to breed an American elite of [[philosopher-kings]] who would have the United States rejoin the British Empire.

We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa\".{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=108}} Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony \"in a state of barbarism and communal tenure\" as \"a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote.&nbsp;... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.\"{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}}\n\nHowever historian Raymond C. Mensing, notes that Rhodes has the reputation  as the most flamboyant exemplar of the British imperial spirit, and always believed that British institutions were the best. Mensing argues that Rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in Africa and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic. According to {{harvnb|Mensing|1986|pp=99\u2013106}} and front page, \"Rhodes was not a [[Scientific racism|biological or maximal racist]]. Despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system, he is best seen as a [[Cultural racism|cultural or minimal racist]]\".\n\nOn domestic politics within Britain, Rhodes was a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Pinney|1995|p=72}} Rhodes' only major impact was his large-scale support of the Irish nationalist party, led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846\u20131891).{{sfn|McCracken|2003|pp=22-24}}\n\nRhodes worked well with the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony. He supported teaching Dutch as well as English in public schools. While Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, he helped to remove most of their legal disabilities. {{sfn|Flint|2009}} He was a friend of [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|Jan Hofmeyr]], leader of the [[Afrikaner Bond]], and it was largely because of Afrikaner support that he became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} Rhodes advocated greater self-government for the Cape Colony, in line with his preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by London.\n\nScholar and Zimbabwean author [[Peter Godwin]], whilst critical of Rhodes, writes that he needs to be viewed via the prisms and cultural and social perspective of his epoch, positing that Rhodes \"was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time...Rhodes and the white pioneers in southern Africa did behave despicably by today's standards, but no worse than the white settlers in North America, South America, and Australia; and in some senses better, considering that the genocide of natives in Africa was less complete. For all the former African colonies are now ruled by indigenous peoples, unlike the Americas and the Antipodes, most of whose aboriginal natives were all but exterminated.\"\n\nGodwin goes on to say \"Rhodes and his cronies fit in perfectly with their surroundings and conformed to the morality (or lack of it) of the day. As is so often the case, history simply followed the gravitational pull of superior firepower.\"\n\n== Personal relationships ==\n\n=== Personal life ===\nRhodes never married, pleading, \"I have too much work on my hands\" and saying that he would not be a dutiful husband.{{sfn|Plomer|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Subsequent historians such as Robin Brown have suggested that Rhodes was a homosexual who was in love with his private secretary, Neville Pickering. Rhodes made Pickering the sole beneficiary of his will, but an accident resulted in Pickering catching septicaemia, during which time Rhodes spent six weeks trying to nurse Pickering back to health. Pickering eventually died in Rhodes' arms.<ref>http://thecasualobserver.co.za/rhodes-enigma-close-male-personal-relationships/</ref><ref>https://city-press.news24.com/Voices/Rhodes-and-his-sexuality-20151106</ref><ref>Robin Brown, ''The Secret Society: Cecil John Rhodes' Plan for a New World Order'' (Penguin: 2015).</ref><ref>https://showme.co.za/lifestyle/the-secret-rhodes/</ref>\n\n=== Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 ===\n\nIn the last years of his life, Rhodes was [[stalking|stalked]] by Polish princess [[Catherine Radziwill|Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], born [[Rzewuski family|Rzewuska]], who had married into the [[szlachta|noble]] Polish family [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]].

The military felt he was more of a liability than an asset and found him intolerable. The officer commanding the garrison of Kimberley, Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], experienced serious personal difficulties with Rhodes because of the latters' inability to co-operate;{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=321\u2013323}}{{sfn|Phelan|1913|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDespite these differences, Rhodes's company was instrumental in the defence of the city, providing water, refrigeration facilities, constructing fortifications, manufacturing an [[armoured train]], shells and a one-off gun named [[Long Cecil]].{{sfn|Roberts|1976|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nRhodes used his position and influence to lobby the British government to relieve the siege of Kimberley, claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate.

On returning to England in 1872, his health again deteriorated with heart and lung problems, to the extent that his doctor, Sir [[Morell Mackenzie]], believed he would only survive six months. He returned to Kimberley where his health improved. From age 40 his heart condition returned with increasing severity until his death from heart failure in 1902, aged 48, at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.{{sfn|The Times|27 March 1902}}\n\nThe government arranged an epic journey by train from the Cape to Rhodesia, with the funeral train stopping at every station to allow mourners to pay their respects. It was reported that at Kimberley, \"practically the entire population marched in procession past the funeral car\".<ref>Mr. Rhodes's Bequests,New-York Tribune, 6 April 1902, Page 4</ref> He was finally laid to rest at World's View, a hilltop located approximately {{convert|35|km|mi}} south of [[Bulawayo]], in what was then [[Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=848}} Today, his grave site is part of [[Matobo National Park]], Zimbabwe.\n\nThe continued presence of Rhodes's grave in the Matopos (now Matobos) hills has not been without controversy in contemporary Zimbabwe. In December 2010, [[Cain Mathema]], the governor of Bulawayo, branded the grave outside the country's second city an \"insult to the African ancestors\" and said he believed its presence had brought bad luck and poor weather to the region. The grave site is considered an important national and historic monument on protected land which attracts many tourist visitors every year.{{sfn|Gore|2013}}\n\nIn February 2012, Mugabe loyalists and [[ZANU-PF]] activists visited the grave site demanding permission from the local chief to exhume Rhodes's remains and return them to Britain. This was considered a nationalist political stunt in the run up to an election, rather than representing any genuine national desire to remove the grave. Local Chief Masuku and Godfrey Mahachi, one of the country's foremost archaeologists, strongly expressed their opposition to the grave being removed due to its historical significance to Zimbabwe. Then-president [[Robert Mugabe]] also opposed the move.{{sfn|Laing|2012}}\n\nIn 2004, he was voted 56th in the [[SABC 3]] television series ''[[Great South Africans (television series)|Great South Africans]]''.{{sfn|Blair|2004}}\n\nAt his death, he was considered one of the wealthiest men in the world.

The book contains a vivid description of Cecil Rhodes himself, seen through the eyes of a traveller from the future British Empire.\n* In the British film ''[[Rhodes of Africa]]'' (1936, directed by Austrian filmmaker [[Berthold Viertel]]), Rhodes was portrayed by Canadian actor [[Walter Huston]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028176/ ''Rhodes of Africa'' (1936)].</ref>\n* Rhodes was played by [[Ferdinand Marian (actor)|Ferdinand Marian]] in the Nazi propaganda film ''[[Ohm Kr\u00fcger]]'' (1941), where he \u2013 like all other British characters in the film \u2013 was presented as an outright villain.\n* In 1901, Rhodes bought [[Dalham Hall]], Suffolk. In 1902, Colonel [[Frank Rhodes (British Army officer)|Frank Rhodes]] erected the village hall{{sfn|Dalham}} in the village of [[Dalham]], near [[Bury St Edmunds]], to commemorate the life of his brother, who had died before taking possession of the estate.\n* Rhodes was a peripheral but influential character in the historical novel ''[[The Covenant (novel)|The Covenant]]'' by [[James Michener]].\n* His memorial at Devil's Peak also served as a temple in ''[[The Adventures of Sinbad]]'' episode \"The Return of the Ronin\".\n* The 1976 [[Hugh Masekela]] album ''[[Colonial Man]]'' has a song  titled \"Cecil Rhodes\".\n* In 1996, BBC-TV made an eight-part television drama about Rhodes called ''[[Rhodes (TV series)|Rhodes: The Life and Legend of Cecil Rhodes]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115335/ \"Rhodes\" on IMDB]</ref> It was produced by David Drury and written by Antony Thomas. It tells the story of Rhodes' life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by [[Martin Shaw]], the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 is played by [[Frances Barber]]. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual.{{sfn|Godwin|1998}} Countering the implication of Rhodes' homosexuality, historian and journalist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote that Rhodes had been falsely smeared by the programme, commenting: \"In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent \u00a310m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.\" [[Peter Godwin]] said of the film that \"it feels like a work overwhelmingly informed by malice, consistently seizing on the very worst interpretation of the man without really attempting to get under his skin. Rhodes was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time.\"\n*Rhodes features prominently in Wilbur Smith\u2019s Ballantyne series of novels, fictional stories based amongst real events in Rhodes\u2019 lifetime\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cecil John Rhodes Statue]]\n* [[Rhodesia (region)]]\n{{Portal bar|Africa|British Empire|Biography|History}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|16em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n=== Monographs ===\n* {{cite book|ref={{sfnref|Aldrich and Wotherspoon|2001}}|last1=Aldrich|first1=Robert |last2=Wotherspoon|first2=Garry |title=Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|url=https://archive.org/details/whoswhoingaylesb00robe|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-15982-1}}\n*{{cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/primatealexander00alexiala#page/258/mode/2up|editor-first= Eleanor |editor-last=Alexander |title= Primate Alexander, Archbishop of Armagh.

It was designed by [[Ernest de Burgh]]. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1457>{{cite NSW SHR|5051355|Beckers Bridge over Webbers Creek|hr=01457|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nErnest de Burgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n===Beckers Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was advertised for tender in 1901, with W.

Following this, the 2012 Roads and Maritime Services Timber Truss Bridge Conservation Strategy identified Beckers Bridge as a target to be removed and replaced in the future. It stated that, although all submissions received had been in support of its retention, it could not meet the load requirements necessary for the route and described it as \"an unremarkable example of its type\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/maintenance/timber-truss-road-bridges/timber-tuss-abercrombie-bridge-wee-jasper-bridge.pdf | title=Individual Bridge Profiles - Timber Truss Road Bridges | publisher=Roads and Management Services | accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/documents/projects/key-build-programs/maintenance/timber-truss-road-bridges/120800-timber-truss-bridges-subs-revised-strategy-august-2012.pdf | title=Timber Truss Bridge Conservation Strategyq | publisher=Roads and Maritime Services | accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, [[Michael Johnsen]], the local MP in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]], published a call for feedback on the design and alignment of a new bridge, after the completion of which the original bridge would be demolished.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.michaeljohnsen.com.au/releases/say-beckers-bridge-replacement/ | title=Have Your Say On Beckers Bridge Replacement | publisher=Michael Johnsen MP | accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref> In 2018, its State Heritage Register listing refers to it as \"under consideration for removal\".<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n== Description ==\nBecker's Bridge is a DeBurgh type timber [[truss]] road bridge. It has a single timber truss [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|27.7|m|ft|0}}. There is a single timber approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|45.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nThe superstructure is supported by timber trestles and provides a carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}}. The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1902, Beckers Bridge is an early example of a DeBurgh timber truss road bridge. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of this type of truss. DeBurgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works engineer Ernest M. DeBurgh, the DeBurgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The DeBurgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nDeBurgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. Situated in the Hunter region, Beckers bridge gains heritage significance because of its proximity to 15 other historic bridges, each constructed before 1905. In 1998 there were 10 surviving DeBurgh trusses in NSW of the 20 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Beckers bridge is a representative example of DeBurgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nBeckers Bridge over Webbers Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest DeBurgh, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\".

It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1457>{{cite NSW SHR|5051355|Beckers Bridge over Webbers Creek|hr=01457|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nErnest de Burgh, the designer of DeBurgh truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer with the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n===Beckers Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was advertised for tender in 1901, with W.

It has a single timber truss [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|27.7|m|ft|0}}. There is a single timber approach span at each end giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|45.4|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nThe superstructure is supported by timber trestles and provides a carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0}}. The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nCompleted in 1902, Beckers Bridge is an early example of a DeBurgh timber truss road bridge. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Ernest DeBurgh, the designer of this type of truss. DeBurgh trusses were fourth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. Designed by Public Works engineer Ernest M. DeBurgh, the DeBurgh truss is an adaptation of the American Pratt truss design. The DeBurgh truss is the first to use significant amounts of steel and iron, and did so in spite of its high cost and the government's historical preference for timber.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nDeBurgh trusses were significant technical improvements over their predecessors. Situated in the Hunter region, Beckers bridge gains heritage significance because of its proximity to 15 other historic bridges, each constructed before 1905. In 1998 there were 10 surviving DeBurgh trusses in NSW of the 20 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Beckers bridge is a representative example of DeBurgh timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\nBeckers Bridge over Webbers Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Ernest DeBurgh, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1457/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\".

First exploited in 1907, this underground operation exploits high-grade gold skarn ore bodies along contacts between Cretaceous granitoid and metamorphosed Paleozoic sediments. The mine, after decades of inactivity, returned to production for several years in the mid-1990s, and again in 2006 and 2007, when a significant variation between actual and predicted headgrades occurred. An updated resource evaluation is pending further work.\n* The Niblack prospect, a [[zinc]]-[[copper]]-[[silver]]-[[gold]] VMS deposit on southeastern [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]], in the Ketchikan Mining District. Ore occurs as massive sulfide bodies hosted in a local rhyolite belt within a package of deeply deformed and metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. In the last ten years, significant underground and surface exploration occurred at this early-1900s minesite. A recent estimate reports a near surface indicated resource of 4073&nbsp;kg of gold, 59,424&nbsp;kg of silver, 14,810 metric tons of copper, and 30,474 metric tons of zinc contained in 1,424,000 metric tons of ore; and deeper inferred resources of 3,919&nbsp;kg of gold, 55,295&nbsp;kg of silver, 31,235 metric tons of copper, and 106,192 metric tons of zinc within 1,893,000 metric tons of ore.<ref>http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Niblack-Mining-Corp-TSX-VENTURE-NIB-898341.html</ref> Further exploration is planned.\n*Many significant exploration efforts for gold, across the state, contributed to the total of over $310 million spent on mineral exploration in Alaska in 2007.\n\n===Placer mining===\n[[Placer mining]] continues throughout Alaska. Placer mine production during the 5 years to 2014 has averaged 74,360 ounces of gold or 8 percent of the total gold produced in Alaska annually. All of these operations are seasonal, none employ more than a few dozen people. Many are family operations with roots reaching back several generations. The 2015 estimate of 120 full-time-equivalent jobs attributed to placer gold mining as reported by the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] is underreported and is considered a minimum estimate.<ref name=ak/>\n\n==Historical lode and placer gold mines==\n===Southeast Alaska===\n====Porcupine district====\nOver {{convert|81,000|ozt|lb kg}} of placer gold came from the Porcupine district near Haines. Porcupine Creek, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of Haines, is the site of an 1898 gold discovery; the creek has been intermittently placer mined ever since. Outside of the Porcupine basin only a few other creeks \u2013 Glacier, Nugget and Cottonwood \u2013 produced significant gold. The area around Reid Inlet, in modern [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve]], hosted several hard rock gold prospects, including the LeRoy mine, which exploited quartz veins for about 10,000 ounces of gold production. The district, which includes [[Skagway]] and [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], is bordered to the north and east by Canada. To the west is the Pacific Ocean and the [[Chichagof Island|Chichagof]] District lies to the south. The [[Discovery Channel]] series [[Gold Rush Alaska]] takes place in this region.\n\n====Juneau district====\n{{Main|Juneau mining district}}\n\nIn 1880 a local inhabitant, Chief Kowee, revealed to prospectors Joe Juneau and Richard Harris the presence of gold in what is now named Gold Creek in Silver Bow Basin. The city of Juneau was founded there that year.  The strike sparked the Juneau gold rush which resulted in the development of many placer and lode mines including the largest, in their time, gold mines in the world: the Treadwell complex of lode mines on Douglas Island (across a narrow sea channel from Juneau) and the AJ lode mine, in Juneau itself.\n\nOver 7 million ounces of lode gold and {{convert|80,000|ozt |lb kg}} of placer gold have been recovered from the Juneau district.\n\n====Admiralty district====\n{{Main|Admiralty mining district}}\n\nMost of the gold recovered from the Admiralty mining district (which consists of Admiralty Island) is a by product of silver and base metal mining. The Alaska Empire underground lode mine recovered gold from quartz veins in [[metamorphic rock]]s. Discovered and staked in the 1920s, production of about 20,000 tonnes of 0.25 ounce-per-ton gold ore occurred in the mid-1930s. The Funter Bay underground lode mine produced about 500 thousand tonnes of copper-nickel-cobalt ore, without gold, from a Mesozoic gabbro-norite pipe. No significant placer mining was done on Admiralty. About 500,000 ounces of gold, almost all from the currently operating Greens Creek lode silver mine, have been recovered from the Admiralty district.\n\n====Chichagof district====\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Chichagof mining district\n|official_name            = \n|settlement_type          = [[Alaska Mining District]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n||pushpin_map            =Alaska\n|pushpin_label_position =left <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    = \n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                =  \n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|coordinates              = {{coord|57|30|N|135|30|W|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n}}\n\nApproximately 800,000 ounces of gold have come from the Chichagof district.

There are over a mile of underground workings, reaching {{convert|2000|ft|m}} below the surface. Significant reserves remain, which have attracted exploration efforts in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n=====Chichagof mine=====\nThe Chichagof mine opened in 1905 and by 1942 had yielded 660,000 ounces of gold and 195,000 ounces of silver from quartz veins assaying over 1 oz gold per ton. There were several miles of workings on 5 levels. Six shafts reached a maximum of {{convert|2750|ft|m}} below sea level.\nBetween 1981 and 1988 several thousand feet of new workings were dug, and engineering and environmental studies were done, but the project was abandoned.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n====Petersburg-Sumdum district====\n15,000 ounces of gold from placers, came from the Petersburg-Sumdum district which consists of; [[Zarembo Island|Zarembo]], [[Etolin Island|Etolin]], and [[Wrangell Island]]s, and the mainland between the [[Juneau mining district|Juneau]] and [[Ketchikan mining district|Ketchikan districts]]. Many small lode deposits were located in the late 1890s and early 1900s. The most significant  lode producer was the Sumdum Chief, which was discovered in 1889 and operated until exhausted in 1903. 24,000 ounces of gold were extracted from two quartz veins averaging ore of about 0.39 ounces per ton of both gold and silver. The mine reached a depth of {{convert|1200|ft|m}} and had a ten-stamp mill. In Windham Bay, a cluster of mineral claim holdings were consolidated in the 1920s; the Jensen mine was the most productive of these, producing about 50 ounces of gold. Several aerial tramways, thousands of feet long, connected various adits and mills.<ref>http://ardf.wr.usgs.gov/ardf_data/Sumdum.pdf</ref>\n\n====Ketchikan district====\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Ketchikan mining district\n|official_name            = \n|settlement_type          = [[Alaska Mining District]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n||pushpin_map            =Alaska\n|pushpin_label_position =left <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    = \n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                =  \n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|coordinates              = {{coord|55|19|N|131|40|W|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n}}\n\nApproximately 58,000 ounces of lode gold and 4000 ounces of placer gold have come from the [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] district, consisting of [[Dall Island|Dall]], [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales]], [[Revillagigedo Island|Revillagigedo]], and smaller islands, as well some mainland, in the southernmost-part of Alaska.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\nNumerous historical lode mines and prospects for base metals, uranium, rare earth elements (REE's), iron, and platinum group elements (PGE's), as well as gold exist in the Ketchikan district. Major gold production came from underground lode mines exploiting: gold-bearing quartz veins in metamorphic rocks (such as the Gold Standard, Sea Level, Dawson, Golden Fleece, and Goldstream mines); skarns (at the Jumbo and Kassan Peninsula copper-gold mines); zoned mafic-ultramafic plutons, as at the Salt Chuck silver-gold-copper-PGE mine; and VMS deposits such as Niblack.\n\nA high-yielding mine in Ketchikan District is the '''Golden Fleece Mine''', located about 0.2 mile north of the north end of James Lake on Prince of Wales Island, latitude: 55.152179, longitude: -132.056635.

Discovery of placer gold in 1906 was quickly followed by lode discoveries. Most of the placer-producing creeks drain the area of lode mineralization.<ref>http://uaf-db.uaf.edu/Jukebox/haul_road_07/assets/docs/sw_wiseman_study.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''University of Alaska, Fairbanks: The Wiseman Historical District''</ref> The district produced about 48,000 ounces of placer gold and 17,000 ounces of lode gold.\n\n=====Little Squaw Creek=====\nLittle Squaw Creek drains an area cut by many auriferous veins. Some of the placers in the basin are exceptionally rich. By 1916 most of the shallow placers were playing out so miners shifted their interest to the placer drift mines (underground operations). The most notable of these is the Little Squaw Bench, including the Mellow Bench. Approximately 29,000 ounces of gold were recovered averaging 1.0 oz/cubic yard of gold in the gravels with spikes of up to 4.6 oz/cubic yard. Some individual nuggets were over 10 ounces.<ref name=autogenerated7>''Alaska Resource Data Files, Chandalar quad, USGS Open file report 00-357''http://ardf.wr.usgs.gov/ardf_data/Chandalar.pdf</ref>  In 2010, gold production resumed with mining of the placer deposits by the Gold Rich Mining Company.\n\n=====Little Squaw and Mikado lodes=====\nIn 1909 to 1915 development and underground gold mining occurred at the Little Squaw, with a few hundred feet of workings built and a few dozen ounces of gold recovered. The nearby Mikado mine enjoyed similar efforts around 1913. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s additional work was done.

The district extends from the southern flank of the Brooks Range to the northern [[Ray Mountains]], and is directly west of the [[Chandalar]] district. Much of the district is now in [[Gates of the Arctic National Park]]. Gold was discovered in placer deposits in the district in 1901. About 350,000 ounces of placer gold have been won from the area, perhaps 85% of it from near [[Wiseman, Alaska|Wiseman]]. Mining continues today in the district.\nMuch of the district is underlain by bedded Paleozoic rocks, a schist belt extends along the southern foothills of the Brooks Range. Cretaceous plutons intrude metamorphic rocks in the southern part of the district. Pleistocene ice sheets from the Brooks Range and cirque glaciers in the Ray Mountains covered much of the higher elevations. Glaciers are now restricted to the highest cirques of the Brooks Range.<ref name=autogenerated6>Placer Deposits of Alaska, USGS Bulletin 1374</ref>\n\n=====Nolan Creek=====\nMiners produced 235,000 ounces of gold from Nolan Creek between 1904 and 1999. Some of the placer gold is mined by underground methods in frozen gravels. A 42-troy ounce nugget, Alaska's twentieth-largest, came from Marys Bench on Nolan Creek. Placer mining activity continues, with a reserve of 214,760 ounces of gold reported in 2000.\n\n=====Hammond River=====\nMining occurred on the Hammond River, a tributary of the Koyukuk River, from about 1900 to at least 2000. Exact production is unknown, but is estimated at about 80,000 ounces.\n\nA rich, deep channel was struck beneath the Hammond River in 1912, and during the following 4 years, over 48,000 oz gold were produced, including a 138.8-oz nugget.  (Pringel, 1921; T.K. Bundtzen, written communication, 1999) \nMuch of the gold was coarse: the third (146 troy oz.), fourth (139 troy oz.), 14th (61 troy ounces), and 17th (55 troy ounces) largest gold nuggets in Alaska were found on the Hammond River between Discovery claim and Vermont Creek a distance of 4 miles. \nOnly the richest ground was possible to mine as the Hammond River was one of the most remote placer districts in North America until 1975 when the Dalton Highway for the Alaskan Pipeline project was completed.\nHistorically the Hammond River is one of the largest gold producers in the Koyukuk district. Gold was discovered on the Hammond River, just above the lower canyon mouth, about 2 miles upstream from the Koyukuk River. In the early years, attempts were made to mine the modern stream gravels. At the mouth of  Swift Creek a wing dam was built to divert the river for mining, but numerous cobbles and small boulders made the venture unprofitable. Approximately 500 ounces was recovered with pick and shovels in Summer of 1902. Later, shafts sunk 66 feet to bedrock at the discovery site were reported to show the presence of gold in paying quantities. The majority of the gold production on the Hammond came out of the deep channel as early miners were unable to deal with the water and cobbles in the present river channel.\n\nThe Hammond River contains deep channel, bench, and modern stream placers. \nMuch of the Hammond River gold is of the coarse nugget variety. Several nuggets weighing from 45 to 59 oz were found in the early days. In 1914 a 138.8 oz nugget (fourth largest in Alaska) was found in a mud-filled crack on bedrock near Gold Bottom Gulch (Engineering and Mining Journal, 1915, p.&nbsp;1021; T. Bundzten, personal communication, 1999).\n\nIn 1914,on No. 4 Above, Hammond River (Goldbottom Gulch), J. C. Kinney and partners picked up nuggets from bedrock valued at about $20,000; one nugget, the second largest ever found in Alaska, was worth $2600. The rest of the dump when sluiced yielded a little less than the value of the \"pickings.\" (Engineering and Mining Journal, 1914, p.&nbsp;1062 Vol. 98 No. 24. (Gold at $20.00 per ounce.)\n\nPlacers on Slisco bench, an ancient buried channel of Hammond River near Vermont Creek on the west side of the present Hammond River contain a measured resource of 31,099 oz gold with grades of up to 0.3 oz/cy. Inferred resources on the same bench range from 50,000 to 150,000 oz. (2002) .  Other benches of Hammond River between Discovery Claim and Slisco Bench have similar potential but have not been systematically prospected with modern technology.\n\nU.S. Department of Interior BLM-Alaska Technical Report 50\nMineral Investigations in the Koyukuk Mining\nDistrict, Northern Alaska\n\nMaddren USGS Bulletin 532  1913\n\n====Hughes District====\nThe Hughes district includes the basin of the lower Koyukuk River (below the Kanuti). Much of the area is a swampy, lake-studded lowland, from which rises rounded hills to elevations of several thousand feet.\n\nPlacer mines in the Zane Hills on Bear Creek, a tributary of the Hogatza River, are the biggest source of gold from the district. Placer deposits clustered near the village of Hughes and Indian Mountain are the other significant source of placer gold from the district. The district has produced about 245,000 ounces, with traces of copper, lead, zinc, tin, silver and platinum.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\n====Melozitna District====\nOn the northern side of the Yukon River, between the Melotizna and Ray rivers, most of the district is rolling ridges with highest elevations over {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, where now-gone Pleistocene cirque glaciers developed. Placer gold was discovered in 1907, but activity was sporadic and poorly recorded.

Cinnabar ([[mercury sulfide]]) occurs in many of the [[placer mine]]s in this district, most notably at Cinnabar Creek.\n\n===== Donlin Creek (feasibility stage) =====\nPlacer mining began on benches and tributaries on the east side of Crooked Creek and its tributary Donlin Creek in 1910; a family-scale placer-mining operation continues today. Granitic dike swarms cutting the shales and sandstones of the Kuskokwim Group rocks in the hills east of upper Crooked Creek were recognized by USGS geologists in 1915 as the probable source of the placer gold.<ref>Maddren, A. G., 1915, ''Gold Placers of the lower Kuskokwim with a note on copper in the Russian Mountains'', USGS Bulletin 622,p292-360</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s [[Calista Corporation]], an [[Alaska Native Corporation]], as part of its land grant under [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act|ANSCA]] selected the land east of Crooked Creek, based on its mineral potential. In 1986 modern hardrock exploration of the Donlin area began with WestGold's efforts, which were abandoned after two years, due not to the lack of gold, but to the refractory (technically difficult to extract from the rock) nature of the gold. PlacerDome signed a lease with Calista and began exploration at Donlin in 1995. That effort continues today, having evolved to a 50:50 partnership between [[Barrick Gold]] and [[NovaGold Resources]], in cooperation with Calista, the landowner. Over 150 million dollars have been expended on exploration, engineering, and environmental studies.\n\nIf eventually exploited, the mine will be an open pit several miles wide. Latest estimates (April 2009) report that Donlin contains 29.3 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves (calculated at a gold price of $750) and an additional 10 million ounces of gold resource.<ref name=\"novagold.com\" /> The gold occurs within the crystal lattice of arsenopyrite associated with other metal sulfides in veins, veinlets, and disseminations mainly in the felsic dikes, but also in less common altered mafic dikes and in the sediments.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Iditarod District====\nThe Iditarod district lies between the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers: the Aniak district abuts it to the south. A gold rush followed the discovery of gold on Otter Creek in 1909. Over 1.5 million ounces of placer gold and a few thousand ounces of lode gold have been recovered from the Iditarod area, making it one of the more important gold-mining districts in Alaska. Much of the gold-producing ground in the district was consolidated by the Morgan-[[Guggenheim family|Guggenheim]] consortium.\n\n=====Tolstoi District=====\nThe drainage basin of Tolstoi Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the Dishna, roughly defines the district. The district lies between the Iditarod and Innoko districts. Placer gold and platinum were discovered by drifting in frozen gravels 35 feet deep on Boob Creek in the winter of 1915\u20131916. A gold rush occurred in the district the following winter. Historic production of 11,000 ounces of gold, as well as some byproduct platinum, is recorded for the district.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaskaminers.org/abstracts2002.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116175718/http://www.alaskaminers.org/abstracts2002.pdf |archive-date=2009-11-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Innoko District====\nThe Aniak district lies to the south, the Tolstoi district to the west. Almost 3/4 million ounces of placer gold has been won from Innoko River and its tributaries in the district. Lode gold production of 150 ounces is also recorded. Cripple, Colorado, Yankee, Games, Ophir, and Little Creeks had prominent placer mines: a third of the districts production came from Ganes Creek. Gold-bearing porphyritic intrusive rocks adjacent to the Ganes Creek and Colorado Creek placers are similar in composition and age to the dike swarms at 29-million ounce Donlin Creek.\n\n=====Ganes Creek=====\nThe property is located approximately 40&nbsp;km west of McGrath, and 440&nbsp;km northwest of Anchorage. Ganes is famous for producing spectacular gold nuggets including the 5th (122 troy ounces) and 13th-largest (62.5 troy ounce) in Alaska. The presence of cobble-size quartz with sulfide boxwork and coarse gold suggest that the placer gold is primary, originating from bedrock sources.

First exploited in 1907, this underground operation exploits high-grade gold skarn ore bodies along contacts between Cretaceous granitoid and metamorphosed Paleozoic sediments. The mine, after decades of inactivity, returned to production for several years in the mid-1990s, and again in 2006 and 2007, when a significant variation between actual and predicted headgrades occurred. An updated resource evaluation is pending further work.\n* The Niblack prospect, a [[zinc]]-[[copper]]-[[silver]]-[[gold]] VMS deposit on southeastern [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]], in the Ketchikan Mining District. Ore occurs as massive sulfide bodies hosted in a local rhyolite belt within a package of deeply deformed and metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. In the last ten years, significant underground and surface exploration occurred at this early-1900s minesite. A recent estimate reports a near surface indicated resource of 4073&nbsp;kg of gold, 59,424&nbsp;kg of silver, 14,810 metric tons of copper, and 30,474 metric tons of zinc contained in 1,424,000 metric tons of ore; and deeper inferred resources of 3,919&nbsp;kg of gold, 55,295&nbsp;kg of silver, 31,235 metric tons of copper, and 106,192 metric tons of zinc within 1,893,000 metric tons of ore.<ref>http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Niblack-Mining-Corp-TSX-VENTURE-NIB-898341.html</ref> Further exploration is planned.\n*Many significant exploration efforts for gold, across the state, contributed to the total of over $310 million spent on mineral exploration in Alaska in 2007.\n\n===Placer mining===\n[[Placer mining]] continues throughout Alaska. Placer mine production during the 5 years to 2014 has averaged 74,360 ounces of gold or 8 percent of the total gold produced in Alaska annually. All of these operations are seasonal, none employ more than a few dozen people. Many are family operations with roots reaching back several generations. The 2015 estimate of 120 full-time-equivalent jobs attributed to placer gold mining as reported by the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] is underreported and is considered a minimum estimate.<ref name=ak/>\n\n==Historical lode and placer gold mines==\n===Southeast Alaska===\n====Porcupine district====\nOver {{convert|81,000|ozt|lb kg}} of placer gold came from the Porcupine district near Haines. Porcupine Creek, about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north of Haines, is the site of an 1898 gold discovery; the creek has been intermittently placer mined ever since. Outside of the Porcupine basin only a few other creeks \u2013 Glacier, Nugget and Cottonwood \u2013 produced significant gold. The area around Reid Inlet, in modern [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve]], hosted several hard rock gold prospects, including the LeRoy mine, which exploited quartz veins for about 10,000 ounces of gold production. The district, which includes [[Skagway]] and [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], is bordered to the north and east by Canada. To the west is the Pacific Ocean and the [[Chichagof Island|Chichagof]] District lies to the south. The [[Discovery Channel]] series [[Gold Rush Alaska]] takes place in this region.\n\n====Juneau district====\n{{Main|Juneau mining district}}\n\nIn 1880 a local inhabitant, Chief Kowee, revealed to prospectors Joe Juneau and Richard Harris the presence of gold in what is now named Gold Creek in Silver Bow Basin. The city of Juneau was founded there that year.  The strike sparked the Juneau gold rush which resulted in the development of many placer and lode mines including the largest, in their time, gold mines in the world: the Treadwell complex of lode mines on Douglas Island (across a narrow sea channel from Juneau) and the AJ lode mine, in Juneau itself.\n\nOver 7 million ounces of lode gold and {{convert|80,000|ozt |lb kg}} of placer gold have been recovered from the Juneau district.\n\n====Admiralty district====\n{{Main|Admiralty mining district}}\n\nMost of the gold recovered from the Admiralty mining district (which consists of Admiralty Island) is a by product of silver and base metal mining. The Alaska Empire underground lode mine recovered gold from quartz veins in [[metamorphic rock]]s. Discovered and staked in the 1920s, production of about 20,000 tonnes of 0.25 ounce-per-ton gold ore occurred in the mid-1930s. The Funter Bay underground lode mine produced about 500 thousand tonnes of copper-nickel-cobalt ore, without gold, from a Mesozoic gabbro-norite pipe. No significant placer mining was done on Admiralty. About 500,000 ounces of gold, almost all from the currently operating Greens Creek lode silver mine, have been recovered from the Admiralty district.\n\n====Chichagof district====\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Chichagof mining district\n|official_name            = \n|settlement_type          = [[Alaska Mining District]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n||pushpin_map            =Alaska\n|pushpin_label_position =left <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    = \n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                =  \n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|coordinates              = {{coord|57|30|N|135|30|W|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n}}\n\nApproximately 800,000 ounces of gold have come from the Chichagof district.

There are over a mile of underground workings, reaching {{convert|2000|ft|m}} below the surface. Significant reserves remain, which have attracted exploration efforts in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n=====Chichagof mine=====\nThe Chichagof mine opened in 1905 and by 1942 had yielded 660,000 ounces of gold and 195,000 ounces of silver from quartz veins assaying over 1 oz gold per ton. There were several miles of workings on 5 levels. Six shafts reached a maximum of {{convert|2750|ft|m}} below sea level.\nBetween 1981 and 1988 several thousand feet of new workings were dug, and engineering and environmental studies were done, but the project was abandoned.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n====Petersburg-Sumdum district====\n15,000 ounces of gold from placers, came from the Petersburg-Sumdum district which consists of; [[Zarembo Island|Zarembo]], [[Etolin Island|Etolin]], and [[Wrangell Island]]s, and the mainland between the [[Juneau mining district|Juneau]] and [[Ketchikan mining district|Ketchikan districts]]. Many small lode deposits were located in the late 1890s and early 1900s. The most significant  lode producer was the Sumdum Chief, which was discovered in 1889 and operated until exhausted in 1903. 24,000 ounces of gold were extracted from two quartz veins averaging ore of about 0.39 ounces per ton of both gold and silver. The mine reached a depth of {{convert|1200|ft|m}} and had a ten-stamp mill. In Windham Bay, a cluster of mineral claim holdings were consolidated in the 1920s; the Jensen mine was the most productive of these, producing about 50 ounces of gold. Several aerial tramways, thousands of feet long, connected various adits and mills.<ref>http://ardf.wr.usgs.gov/ardf_data/Sumdum.pdf</ref>\n\n====Ketchikan district====\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Ketchikan mining district\n|official_name            = \n|settlement_type          = [[Alaska Mining District]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n||pushpin_map            =Alaska\n|pushpin_label_position =left <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    = \n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                =  \n|mapsize                  = \n|map_caption              = \n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|coordinates              = {{coord|55|19|N|131|40|W|type:landmark|display=inline}}\n}}\n\nApproximately 58,000 ounces of lode gold and 4000 ounces of placer gold have come from the [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] district, consisting of [[Dall Island|Dall]], [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales]], [[Revillagigedo Island|Revillagigedo]], and smaller islands, as well some mainland, in the southernmost-part of Alaska.<ref name=autogenerated5 />\nNumerous historical lode mines and prospects for base metals, uranium, rare earth elements (REE's), iron, and platinum group elements (PGE's), as well as gold exist in the Ketchikan district. Major gold production came from underground lode mines exploiting: gold-bearing quartz veins in metamorphic rocks (such as the Gold Standard, Sea Level, Dawson, Golden Fleece, and Goldstream mines); skarns (at the Jumbo and Kassan Peninsula copper-gold mines); zoned mafic-ultramafic plutons, as at the Salt Chuck silver-gold-copper-PGE mine; and VMS deposits such as Niblack.\n\nA high-yielding mine in Ketchikan District is the '''Golden Fleece Mine''', located about 0.2 mile north of the north end of James Lake on Prince of Wales Island, latitude: 55.152179, longitude: -132.056635.

Discovery of placer gold in 1906 was quickly followed by lode discoveries. Most of the placer-producing creeks drain the area of lode mineralization.<ref>http://uaf-db.uaf.edu/Jukebox/haul_road_07/assets/docs/sw_wiseman_study.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''University of Alaska, Fairbanks: The Wiseman Historican District''</ref> The district produced about 48,000 ounces of placer gold and 17,000 ounces of lode gold.\n\n=====Little Squaw Creek=====\nLittle Squaw Creek drains an area cut by many auriferous veins. Some of the placers in the basin are exceptionally rich. By 1916 most of the shallow placers were playing out so miners shifted their interest to the placer drift mines (underground operations). The most notable of these is the Little Squaw Bench, including the Mellow Bench. Approximately 29,000 ounces of gold were recovered averaging 1.0 oz/cubic yard of gold in the gravels with spikes of up to 4.6 oz/cubic yard. Some individual nuggets were over 10 ounces.<ref name=autogenerated7>''Alaska Resource Data Files, Chandalar quad, USGS Open file report 00-357''http://ardf.wr.usgs.gov/ardf_data/Chandalar.pdf</ref>  In 2010, gold production resumed with mining of the placer deposits by the Gold Rich Mining Company.\n\n=====Little Squaw and Mikado lodes=====\nIn 1909 to 1915 development and underground gold mining occurred at the Little Squaw, with a few hundred feet of workings built and a few dozen ounces of gold recovered. The nearby Mikado mine enjoyed similar efforts around 1913. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s additional work was done.

The district extends from the southern flank of the Brooks Range to the northern [[Ray Mountains]], and is directly west of the [[Chandalar]] district. Much of the district is now in [[Gates of the Arctic National Park]]. Gold was discovered in placer deposits in the district in 1901. About 350,000 ounces of placer gold have been won from the area, perhaps 85% of it from near [[Wiseman, Alaska|Wiseman]]. Mining continues today in the district.\nMuch of the district is underlain by bedded Paleozoic rocks, a schist belt extends along the southern foothills of the Brooks Range. Cretaceous plutons intrude metamorphic rocks in the southern part of the district. Pleistocene ice sheets from the Brooks Range and cirque glaciers in the Ray Mountains covered much of the higher elevations. Glaciers are now restricted to the highest cirques of the Brooks Range.<ref name=autogenerated6>Placer Deposits of Alaska, USGS Bulletin 1374</ref>\n\n=====Nolan Creek=====\nMiners produced 235,000 ounces of gold from Nolan Creek between 1904 and 1999. Some of the placer gold is mined by underground methods in frozen gravels. A 42-troy ounce nugget, Alaska's twentieth-largest, came from Marys Bench on Nolan Creek. Placer mining activity continues, with a reserve of 214,760 ounces of gold reported in 2000.\n\n=====Hammond River=====\nMining occurred on the Hammond River, a tributary of the Koyukuk River, from about 1900 to at least 2000. Exact production is unknown, but is estimated at about 80,000 ounces.\n\nA rich, deep channel was struck beneath the Hammond River in 1912, and during the following 4 years, over 48,000 oz gold were produced, including a 138.8-oz nugget.  (Pringel, 1921; T.K. Bundtzen, written communication, 1999) \nMuch of the gold was coarse: the third (146 troy oz.), fourth (139 troy oz.), 14th (61 troy ounces), and 17th (55 troy ounces) largest gold nuggets in Alaska were found on the Hammond River between Discovery claim and Vermont Creek a distance of 4 miles. \nOnly the richest ground was possible to mine as the Hammond River was one of the most remote placer districts in North America until 1975 when the Dalton Highway for the Alaskan Pipeline project was completed.\nHistorically the Hammond River is one of the largest gold producers in the Koyukuk district. Gold was discovered on the Hammond River, just above the lower canyon mouth, about 2 miles upstream from the Koyukuk River. In the early years, attempts were made to mine the modern stream gravels. At the mouth of  Swift Creek a wing dam was built to divert the river for mining, but numerous cobbles and small boulders made the venture unprofitable. Approximately 500 ounces was recovered with pick and shovels in Summer of 1902. Later, shafts sunk 66 feet to bedrock at the discovery site were reported to show the presence of gold in paying quantities. The majority of the gold production on the Hammond came out of the deep channel as early miners were unable to deal with the water and cobbles in the present river channel.\n\nThe Hammond River contains deep channel, bench, and modern stream placers. \nMuch of the Hammond River gold is of the coarse nugget variety. Several nuggets weighing from 45 to 59 oz were found in the early days. In 1914 a 138.8 oz nugget (fourth largest in Alaska) was found in a mud-filled crack on bedrock near Gold Bottom Gulch (Engineering and Mining Journal, 1915, p.&nbsp;1021; T. Bundzten, personal communication, 1999).\n\nIn 1914,on No. 4 Above, Hammond River (Goldbottom Gulch), J. C. Kinney and partners picked up nuggets from bedrock valued at about $20,000; one nugget, the second largest ever found in Alaska, was worth $2600. The rest of the dump when sluiced yielded a little less than the value of the \"pickings.\" (Engineering and Mining Journal, 1914, p.&nbsp;1062 Vol. 98 No. 24. (Gold at $20.00 per ounce.)\n\nPlacers on Slisco bench, an ancient buried channel of Hammond River near Vermont Creek on the west side of the present Hammond River contain a measured resource of 31,099 oz gold with grades of up to 0.3 oz/cy. Inferred resources on the same bench range from 50,000 to 150,000 oz. (2002) .  Other benches of Hammond River between Discovery Claim and Slisco Bench have similar potential but have not been systematically prospected with modern technology.\n\nU.S. Department of Interior BLM-Alaska Technical Report 50\nMineral Investigations in the Koyukuk Mining\nDistrict, Northern Alaska\n\nMaddren USGS Bulletin 532  1913\n\n====Hughes District====\nThe Hughes district includes the basin of the lower Koyukuk River (below the Kanuti). Much of the area is a swampy, lake-studded lowland, from which rises rounded hills to elevations of several thousand feet.\n\nPlacer mines in the Zane Hills on Bear Creek, a tributary of the Hogatza River, are the biggest source of gold from the district. Placer deposits clustered near the village of Hughes and Indian Mountain are the other significant source of placer gold from the district. The district has produced about 245,000 ounces, with traces of copper, lead, zinc, tin, silver and platinum.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\n====Melozitna District====\nOn the northern side of the Yukon River, between the Melotizna and Ray rivers, most of the district is rolling ridges with highest elevations over {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, where now-gone Pleistocene cirque glaciers developed. Placer gold was discovered in 1907, but activity was sporadic and poorly recorded.

Cinnabar ([[mercury sulfide]]) occurs in many of the [[placer mine]]s in this district, most notably at Cinnabar Creek.\n\n===== Donlin Creek (feasibility stage) =====\nPlacer mining began on benches and tributaries on the east side of Crooked Creek and its tributary Donlin Creek in 1910; a family-scale placer-mining operation continues today. Granitic dike swarms cutting the shales and sandstones of the Kuskokwim Group rocks in the hills east of upper Crooked Creek were recognized by USGS geologists in 1915 as the probable source of the placer gold.<ref>Maddren, A. G., 1915, ''Gold Placers of the lower Kuskokwim with a note on copper in the Russian Mountains'', USGS Bulletin 622,p292-360</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s [[Calista Corporation]], an [[Alaska Native Corporation]], as part of its land grant under [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act|ANSCA]] selected the land east of Crooked Creek, based on its mineral potential. In 1986 modern hardrock exploration of the Donlin area began with WestGold's efforts, which were abandoned after two years, due not to the lack of gold, but to the refractory (technically difficult to extract from the rock) nature of the gold. PlacerDome signed a lease with Calista and began exploration at Donlin in 1995. That effort continues today, having evolved to a 50:50 partnership between [[Barrick Gold]] and [[NovaGold Resources]], in cooperation with Calista, the landowner. Over 150 million dollars have been expended on exploration, engineering, and environmental studies.\n\nIf eventually exploited, the mine will be an open pit several miles wide. Latest estimates (April 2009) report that Donlin contains 29.3 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves (calculated at a gold price of $750) and an additional 10 million ounces of gold resource.<ref name=\"novagold.com\" /> The gold occurs within the crystal lattice of arsenopyrite associated with other metal sulfides in veins, veinlets, and disseminations mainly in the felsic dikes, but also in less common altered mafic dikes and in the sediments.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Iditarod District====\nThe Iditarod district lies between the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers: the Aniak district abuts it to the south. A gold rush followed the discovery of gold on Otter Creek in 1909. Over 1.5 million ounces of placer gold and a few thousand ounces of lode gold have been recovered from the Iditarod area, making it one of the more important gold-mining districts in Alaska. Much of the gold-producing ground in the district was consolidated by the Morgan-[[Guggenheim family|Guggenheim]] consortium.\n\n=====Tolstoi District=====\nThe drainage basin of Tolstoi Creek, a north-flowing tributary of the Dishna, roughly defines the district. The district lies between the Iditarod and Innoko districts. Placer gold and platinum were discovered by drifting in frozen gravels 35 feet deep on Boob Creek in the winter of 1915\u20131916. A gold rush occurred in the district the following winter. Historic production of 11,000 ounces of gold, as well as some byproduct platinum, is recorded for the district.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaskaminers.org/abstracts2002.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116175718/http://www.alaskaminers.org/abstracts2002.pdf |archive-date=2009-11-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Innoko District====\nThe Aniak district lies to the south, the Tolstoi district to the west. Almost 3/4 million ounces of placer gold has been won from Innoko River and its tributaries in the district. Lode gold production of 150 ounces is also recorded. Cripple, Colorado, Yankee, Games, Ophir, and Little Creeks had prominent placer mines: a third of the districts production came from Ganes Creek. Gold-bearing porphyritic intrusive rocks adjacent to the Ganes Creek and Colorado Creek placers are similar in composition and age to the dike swarms at 29-million ounce Donlin Creek.\n\n=====Ganes Creek=====\nThe property is located approximately 40&nbsp;km west of McGrath, and 440&nbsp;km northwest of Anchorage. Ganes is famous for producing spectacular gold nuggets including the 5th (122 troy ounces) and 13th-largest (62.5 troy ounce) in Alaska. The presence of cobble-size quartz with sulfide boxwork and coarse gold suggest that the placer gold is primary, originating from bedrock sources. Historical production figures from Ganes Creek are in excess of 250,000 oz. gold; an additional estimated resource of 736,000 oz. of placer gold exists on patented claims.<ref>''Press Release, Full Metal Minerals''</ref>\n\n====McGrath-McKinley district====\nAlmost 200,000 ounces of lode gold and over 130,000 ounces of placer gold have come from the district. The district lies on the northeast side of the Aniak district.\n\n=====The Nixon Fork mine (operation suspended)=====\nThe Nixon Fork mine is an underground lode gold-copper mine located {{convert|32|mi|km}} northeast of [[McGrath, Alaska]]. Placer gold was discovered nearby in 1917, by 1918 hardrock mining was underway, and continued intermittently until 1964. Ore consists of shoots of massive sulfides and native gold found with skarns along the contact of sedimentary rocks and the Mystery Creek quartz monzonite stock. The mine was reopened for exploration, permitted, and developed by Nevada Goldfields, Inc. in 1995 and operated until 1999. In 2005 resource and exploration development resumed. Gold production occurred in 2006 and 2007, production is currently suspended. Production has totaled 187,000 ounces of gold, 2,190,000 pounds of copper, and at least 11,000 ounces of silver.<ref>[http://www.standrewgoldfields.com/SiteResources/ViewContent.asp?DocID=127&v1ID=&RevID=154&lang=1 St. Andrew Goldfields<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Two small ore bodies have proven and probable reserves of approximately 126,400 tonnes, containing 133,730 ounces of gold.

About 600,000 ounces of [[platinum]] (plus some [[iridium]], [[osmium]], [[ruthenium]], [[palladium]], and [[rhenium]]) and 27,000 ounces of gold were won from placer deposits in the [[Salmon River (Portland Canal)|Salmon River]] from 1934 to 1976. Present reserves are unknown, but are the subject of ongoing exploration. The source of the platinum-group elements appears to be in the [[Red Mountain (Alaska)|Red Mountain]] and Susie Mountain [[ultramafic]] rocks. Extensive [[geochemical]] and [[geophysical]] surveys during the past several years have identified areas with as much as 0.1 ounce per ton platinum in the soils, but no reserve has been demonstrated.\n\n===Seward Peninsula===\nSurveyors belonging to the 1865 Count Bendeleben expedition exploring a route across Siberia, the Bering Sea, and Alaska for a communications cable reported gold in the Fish River area of the Seward Peninsula.

However, there are problems that are in QMA but not known to be in NP or BQP. Some such well known problems are discussed below.\n\nA problem is said to be QMA-hard, analogous to [[NP-hard]], if every problem in QMA can be [[Reduction (complexity)|reduced]] to it.

A k-local Hamiltonian is a Hamiltonian which can be written as the sum of Hamiltonians, each of which act non-trivially on at most k qubits (instead of all n qubits).\n\nThe k-local Hamiltonian problem, which is a [[promise problem]], is defined as follows. The input is a k-local Hamiltonian acting on n qubits, which is the sum of polynomially many Hermitian matrices that act on only k qubits. The input also contains two numbers <math>a< b \\in [0,1]</math>, such that <math>\\frac{1}{b-a}=O(n^c)</math> for some constant c.

The dual heritage-listed<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=\"VHD\"/> bridge crosses the border between the Australian states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], linking the Victorian towns of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] and [[Bethanga]] with the regional New South Wales city of [[Albury]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\nThe first crossing of the Murray River by white men occurred in November 1824 when [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] led an expedition from [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] in search of an overland route to Westernport Bay. Their crossing point was some distance up river from Albury and an obelisk near the river commemorates this. Hume and Hovell came upon the river on 16 November 1824, naming it the Hume River, and inscribing a tree near the riverbank the next day before moving on to the south. In 1829, the explorer Captain Charles Sturt discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Not realising it was indeed the Hume, he named it the Murray River. Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray.<ref name=nswshr-1750>{{cite NSW SHR|5056556|Bethanga Bridge|hr=01750|fn=H00/00301, EF14/4310|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe explorers route was shortly followed by white squatters and their livestock, mainly sheep and cattle. Subsequently, many families took up parcels of grazing land on the rich river flatlands, among the first being William Wyse and [[Charles Ebden]]. The drovers track that developed along the line of the advancing squatters, and subsequently by their excess stock returning for sale at [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] markets, led naturally to the same point Hume and Hovell first sighted the river. Although an easier crossing point could be found 10 miles upstream (where the [[Hume Dam]] now stands) the original site by Hume and Hovel's inscribed tree became the popular crossing place for people and stock on their way to new settlements in the south.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nCrossing the river during the drier summer months could normally be achieved on foot. When the river was high after heavy rains or snow melting in the mountains crossing became difficult until a log punt was built in 1844. Stock, however, had to swim.\nThe first bridge over the Murray was built in 1860 near the present crossing at Albury. People up and down stream had to find their own fords, or trek back to Albury.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe arrival of the first railroad from Melbourne in 1873 boosted the district and captured the Southern [[Riverina]] markets for Melbourne. The rail line from Sydney reached Albury in 1881, but the first railway bridge over the Murray was not opened until 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Bethanga-Talgarno gold and copper field became one of the top copper producers in Victoria although both minerals proved difficult to extract from the intractable ores. The alluvial field was first reported in 1852 and was visited by mining officials in 1854, but the field was not really opened up until the discovery of the New Year's Gift reef on 1 January 1876. This led to a number of highly capitalised mining ventures. Harris and Hollow, a mining partnership from [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]], built a smelting works on the flats of lower Bethanga with a view to smelting copper for the public and opened the first furnace of their Great Eastern Copper Smelting works in January 1878. [[John Wallace (Australian politician)|John Wallace]] MLC took an interest in the Bethanga mining scene and purchased mining leases and major mines at Bethanga, then built his own smelting works to treat the ore, completing three furnaces by June 1878. The Bethanga Goldfields Ltd company made a takeover in 1895 and both metals were mined and treated. Mining however, continued only sporadically into the 20th century, with further leads opened at Mt Corryong and Mt. Talgarno. There was a brief revival in the 1930s and some mines struggled on to at least 1945, but in the latter half of the 20th century mining ceased and the town gradually diminished (Bannear).<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe concept of damning Australian rivers for irrigation and flood mitigation was first investigated back in the days of the steamers. The Hume Dam was proposed under the River Murray Waters Agreement, which was signed on 9 September 1914, by the Prime Minister, [[Joseph Cook]], and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and [[South Australia]]. The first sod was turned by His Excellency, the Right Honourable Sir Ronald Crawford Munro-Ferguson, [[Governor-General of Australia]], on 28 November 1919.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nH. V. Beresford was construction engineer on the Hume Weir from about 1925, but died while still engaged on the project in 1927. At the height of construction, more than 1100 workers were employed at the site. These workers were housed in two fully serviced towns adjacent to the site, one on either side of the river.<ref name=nswshr-1750-15>River Murray Commission 1928</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nConstruction of the weir took seventeen years with the reservoir being completed and officially opened by the Right Honourable Lord Gowrie, Governor of NSW, on 21 November 1936 and a plaque on the northern pier of the dam commemorates the occasion. The Bethanga Bridge was evidently constructed in the middle of this period, probably when water backing-up behind the rising dam wall, began to reach the low level bridge at Bethanga.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThree engineers of note were involved in formulating the agreement, [[Ernest de Burgh]], the Chief Engineer of the Water Supply Branch of the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]], J. S. Detheridge the Commissioner, State Rivers and Water Supply of Victoria, and G. Stewart in South Australia. The initial designs for Hume Dam were prepared by de Burgh and Detheridge. NSW was responsible for construction of the concrete dam and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria was responsible for the southern earth embankments.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nAnother Victorian engineer, Ettore Checchi (1853-1946) was closely connected with the Hume Dam project in the 1920s and 30s. However, as his skills were with hydrographic work, it is unclear what contribution he had to the associated structures such as Bethanga Bridge. The State Rivers and Water supply Commission undertook at least some of the Hume Weir works in conjunction with the NSW Public Works Department. The [[River Murray Commission]] evidently had an overriding supervision of the works, but engineering and design details were left to the established public works engineers in the two states.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe heavy cost of Victoria's irrigation infrastructure lead to a parliamentary inquiry into the Commission's finances in 1928, and recommendations against further irrigation investment in an era of low export returns from primary produce. However, the Hume scheme appears to have been immune to any cuts due to the State - Federal agreement and advanced stage of the project. The NSW Department of Public Works carried out modifications between 1950 and 1961 to enlarge the dam to about twice its original size to the present capacity of {{convert|3038|GL|e9impgal e9USgal}} to accommodate diverted water from the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n===The place===\nAs a result of the construction of the weir, the water level in the Murray River backed up behind the dam to permanently inundate the floodplain, which was up to several kilometres wide in many places.<ref name=nswshr-1750/> Although confirmation of the construction authority is yet to be found, there is later evidence in the form of lantern slides showing the construction of the bridge and clearly intended for public presentation, that the bridge was substantially the work of the SRWSC.<ref name=SWRSC>SRWSC collection, [[State Library of Victoria]], Pictures Collection.</ref> The involvement of the NSW Public Works Department is also implied by photographs of components fabricated by Charles Ruwolt and Sons held by Museum Victoria. It is therefore very likely that the New South Wales Public Works Department and Victorian State Rivers and Water supply commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction, as was the case with the Hume Dam itself.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is roughly contemporary with and is similar in design to the [[Yarrawonga, Victoria|Yarrawonga]] Bridge at [[Lake Mulwala]], which was designed by NSW [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] Engineer Percy Allen and constructed in 1924, also as a result of the creation of an artificial lake on the Murray River. The other prominent engineers involved in the Hume Project, Ettore Checchi, Ernest deBurgh, and J. S. Detheridge, were water supply engineers or had ceased to be involved when the bridge was built.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThere was a pattern in NSW/Victoria relationships over the Murray River border for NSW to design Murray River bridges, and Victoria to built them. Other examples of the arrangement can be found in the [[Swan Hill]] bridge and many timber bridges. Bethanga Bridge is similar to other large NSW bridges such as the Hawkesbury bridges, and uncharacteristic of Victorian bridge design practice.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe sequence of SRWSC lantern slides show the progressive construction of the Bethanga Bridge. Construction commenced in 1927 with clearance of the foundation sites and piling. By 1928 the piers were well under way and staging commenced from each bank. By 1929 all the piers were in place and waters had risen to the base of the piers. Erection of the trusses was underway. Falsework of underslung, divided Warren-type, metal trusses supported on three intermediate steel lattice towers, were used as staging for erecting the Pratt trusses. These were assembled in situ with the use of a travelling crane running across the falsework and hot riveting of preformed, punched and cut angle and flat section steel. As the permanent trusses were completed the staging was dismantled and moved on to the next span.<ref name=SWRSC/> Steel work for the bridge was fabricated at least in part, by Vickers Ruwolt of Burnley Melbourne. Photographs of components such as the truss members and bearings are in the collection of Museum Victoria. At least one of the main trusses was trial assembled at Vickers Ruwolt's Burnley works, probably one of the largest structures to be erected in this fashion.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge was clearly seen as a landmark and complementary to the Hume Dam itself in terms of national pride and potential tourist value. The State Rivers documented the bridge's construction and produced a series of lantern slides showing progress. A number of hand coloured slides and images were produced of the finished bridge to show it at its most impressive. The Victorian Railways also produced its own series of photographs in the 1940s and 50s presenting the bridge as part of a dramatic landscape and engineering achievement, probably for promoting tourist visits(by train) to the region. The bridge has been included in several Postcard series of the natural and man-made features of Albury in the 1950s and 60s under titles such as ''A Souvenir of Beautiful Albury''.<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=SWRSC/> The bridge was constructed at a cost of {{circa}}&nbsp;[[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]194,000{{spaced endash}}210,000.<ref name=EA>{{cite web |url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Bethanga%20Bridge.Nomination.V5.Sept%202015.docx.pdf |title=Nomination for Recognition of the Bethanga Bridge |work=EHA Heritage Recognition Program |publisher=[[Engineers Australia]] |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|13.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side was constructed in 1963 as part of the upgrading of the Hume Dam.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe town of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] at the southern end of the bridge, was created to replace facilities inundated by the reservoir. The bridge is currently managed by River Murray Water, although it is understood that the RTA, [[VicRoads]] and River Murray Water are negotiating on the future management responsibility for the bridge. A current {{convert|33|t|ST LT|0|adj=on}} load limit applies and recent tenders have been advertised for the cleaning and repainting of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1750-16>Advertisement for Bethanga Bridge Rehabilitation VicRoads tenders 5858</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe Bethanga Bridge is a road bridge over a flooded section of a Murray River valley that now forms part of the Hume Dam. The bridge consists of nine [[Span (architecture)|spans]] of {{convert|82|m|ft|0}}, each span being supported between double reinforced concrete [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]] by a riveted steel camel back Pratt [[truss]] plus a {{convert|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side. The overall span is {{convert|752|m|ft|0}}. The road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with the current concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. The road deck is {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}} wide. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam. In 2005 the waffle slab decking was replaced to raise ther load capacity, new guard rails were installed and the NSW approach to the bridge was widened for safety reasons. These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge comprises riveted steel [[Pratt truss|Pratt through trusses]] on multiple reinforced concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and reinforced concrete \"[[waffle slab]]\" deck on steel beams. There are nine identical principle spans of arched upper cord giving a truss variable depth. This form is also known as \"Hog-backed\" Camel-back\" and \"Parker\" truss in the USA. There are overhead diagonally braced frames and under deck diagonal \"X\" bracing between riveted plate cross girder beams. The short approach span on the NSW side has RSJ beams with straight transverse cross-braces. The main truss spans have ten [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with nine vertical compression chords and eight diagonal tension chords.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is on the southern bank of the river. All structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales. Because of its unique location, over the waters of a dam with the border running down the centre of the body of water, the Bethanga Bridge is the only built structure shared by both New South Wales and Victoria and listed on both the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]<ref name=nswshr-1750/> and the [[Victorian Heritage Register|Victorian Heritage Database]].<ref name=\"VHD\">{{cite VHD|12738|Bethanga Bridge|hr=12738|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nThe road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with a concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam.

These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Pratt truss was an American style bridge truss that began the tide of change from British to American bridge technology in the nineteenth century. The Bethanga example comes from a period when Pratt trusses were an established design alternative, favoured by railways but generally shunned in Victorian road bridge design. It is a type of truss in which vertical web members are in compression and diagonal web members in tension. Many possible configurations include pitched, flat, or camelback top chords. It may be recognised by diagonal members which appear to form a \"V\" shape toward the centre of the truss when viewed in profile. Variations include the Baltimore truss and Pennsylvania truss. Elaboration in the form of variable depth from sloping upper chords as in the Camel-back arrangement, reduced the amount of steel required, and also dead weight for a similar strength. The Pratt truss compares to Warren truss and Howe designs in the different compression and tension arrangements of diagonal and vertical members. It was named for Thomas W. and Caleb Pratt (Boston railway engineers), who were issued a patent for a truss bearing their name in April 1844.<ref>Waddell 1891; Hughes Trueman Reinhold 1998, RTA NSW.</ref>\n\nThe overall length is given in VicRoads inventory as {{convert|733|m|ft|0}} although a deck length of {{convert|752.4|m|ft|0}} and total length of {{convert|750|m|ft|0}} in their inspection system appears more probable. The nine truss spans are each {{convert|82|m|ft|0}} with the NSW approach span being {{convert|12.5|m|0}}; clear height is {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} and width {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}}. Concrete endposts frame the entry to the bridge. The construction date is cast in the one end post.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe original wooden road surface has been raised once and twice replaced, the railings replaced and the NSW approach modified. Nevertheless, Bethanga Bridge remains substantially the same structure erected in the 1920s.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nBethanga Bridge was built between 1927 and 1930 as a joint venture between New South Wales and Victoria as part of the Hume Dam project as a key element of the River Murray Waters Agreement put in place in 1915 by the Victorian, New South Wales, South Australian and Federal governments to regulate the flow of the Murray River as a provision against drought and to ensure that the three states received their agreed share of water.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe use of Pratt trusses is unusual in Victoria, not being readily taken up as a viable bridge design. However they are more common in New South Wales. The use of the Pratt truss in this instance reflects the mode of construction employed during the construction of the Hume Dam whereby the New South Wales Department of Public Works and the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction of the bridge. The bridge was designed in New South Wales by Department of Main Roads engineer Percy Allen and the trusses were built by Vickers Ruwolt in Melbourne.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is the top of the southern bank of the river. As such all structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales. Because of its unique location, over the waters of a dam with the border running down the centre of the body of water, the Bethanga bridge is the only built structure shared by both New South Wales and Victoria.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is of historical and scientific (technical) significance to New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is of historical significance to tNew South Wales for its associations with the construction of Hume Dam. It is also of historical significance for its associations with The River Murray Waters Agreement and the River Murray Commission which had the task of putting the agreement into effect. The Agreement was a landmark document that drew on the cooperation of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to regulate the flow of the Murray River.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is of scientific (technical) significance for the unusual use in Victoria of Pratt trusses, a predominantly NSW technology, its construction. The Pratt truss was frequently used in New South Wales but this represents a rare example of its use in Victoria. The use of this system in this instance, its design by New South Wales and construction by Victoria, also represents the cooperation of New South Wales and Victoria in the development and ongoing use of major infrastructure.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 26 May 2006 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of historical significance to New South Wales for its associations with the construction of Hume Dam, a major national undertaking of the early twentieth century. It is also of historical significance for its associations with The River Murray Waters Agreement and the River Murray Commission which had the task of putting the agreement into effect. The Agreement was a landmark document that drew on the cooperation of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to regulate the flow of the Murray River. The bridge reflects the engineering and design approaches of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and New South Wales Public Works Department in the late 1920s and the influence of American engineering Practice in the use of the Pratt truss. The bridge is also a significanc marker of the anticipated development that the new Hume Weir was expected to bring to the region, serving, as it did, only a few small farming communities and the copper and gold mining areas of Bethanga and Talarno, which were already in steep decline at the time the bridge was completed.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of technical significance for the unusual use in Victoria of Pratt trusses, a predominantly NSW technology based on American engineering practice . The Pratt truss was frequently used in New South Wales but this represents a rare example of its use in Victoria. The use of this system in this instance, its design by New South Wales and construction by Victoria, also represents the cooperation of New South Wales and Victoria in the development and ongoing use of major infrastructure. Bethanga Bridge is a representative example of Pratt Truss design displaying the main characteristics at a scale that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design over long spans and of its repetition to create a bridge of considerable overall length.

The dual heritage-listed<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=\"VHD\"/> bridge crosses the border between the Australian states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], linking the Victorian towns of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] and [[Bethanga]] with the regional New South Wales city of [[Albury]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Context===\nThe first crossing of the Murray River by white men occurred in November 1824 when [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] led an expedition from [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] in search of an overland route to Westernport Bay. Their crossing point was some distance up river from Albury and an obelisk near the river commemorates this. Hume and Hovell came upon the river on 16 November 1824, naming it the Hume River, and inscribing a tree near the riverbank the next day before moving on to the south. In 1829, the explorer Captain Charles Sturt discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. Not realising it was indeed the Hume, he named it the Murray River. Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray.<ref name=nswshr-1750>{{cite NSW SHR|5056556|Bethanga Bridge|hr=01750|fn=H00/00301, EF14/4310|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe explorers route was shortly followed by white squatters and their livestock, mainly sheep and cattle. Subsequently, many families took up parcels of grazing land on the rich river flatlands, among the first being William Wyse and [[Charles Ebden]]. The drovers track that developed along the line of the advancing squatters, and subsequently by their excess stock returning for sale at [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] markets, led naturally to the same point Hume and Hovell first sighted the river. Although an easier crossing point could be found 10 miles upstream (where the [[Hume Dam]] now stands) the original site by Hume and Hovel's inscribed tree became the popular crossing place for people and stock on their way to new settlements in the south.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nCrossing the river during the drier summer months could normally be achieved on foot. When the river was high after heavy rains or snow melting in the mountains crossing became difficult until a log punt was built in 1844. Stock, however, had to swim.\nThe first bridge over the Murray was built in 1860 near the present crossing at Albury. People up and down stream had to find their own fords, or trek back to Albury.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe arrival of the first railroad from Melbourne in 1873 boosted the district and captured the Southern [[Riverina]] markets for Melbourne. The rail line from Sydney reached Albury in 1881, but the first railway bridge over the Murray was not opened until 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Bethanga-Talgarno gold and copper field became one of the top copper producers in Victoria although both minerals proved difficult to extract from the intractable ores. The alluvial field was first reported in 1852 and was visited by mining officials in 1854, but the field was not really opened up until the discovery of the New Year's Gift reef on 1 January 1876. This led to a number of highly capitalised mining ventures. Harris and Hollow, a mining partnership from [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]], built a smelting works on the flats of lower Bethanga with a view to smelting copper for the public and opened the first furnace of their Great Eastern Copper Smelting works in January 1878. [[John Wallace (Australian politician)|John Wallace]] MLC took an interest in the Bethanga mining scene and purchased mining leases and major mines at Bethanga, then built his own smelting works to treat the ore, completing three furnaces by June 1878. The Bethanga Goldfields Ltd company made a takeover in 1895 and both metals were mined and treated. Mining however, continued only sporadically into the 20th century, with further leads opened at Mt Corryong and Mt. Talgarno. There was a brief revival in the 1930s and some mines struggled on to at least 1945, but in the latter half of the 20th century mining ceased and the town gradually diminished (Bannear).<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe concept of damning Australian rivers for irrigation and flood mitigation was first investigated back in the days of the steamers. The Hume Dam was proposed under the River Murray Waters Agreement, which was signed on 9 September 1914, by the Prime Minister, [[Joseph Cook]], and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and [[South Australia]]. The first sod was turned by His Excellency, the Right Honourable Sir Ronald Crawford Munro-Ferguson, [[Governor-General of Australia]], on 28 November 1919.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nH. V. Beresford was construction engineer on the Hume Weir from about 1925, but died while still engaged on the project in 1927. At the height of construction, more than 1100 workers were employed at the site. These workers were housed in two fully serviced towns adjacent to the site, one on either side of the river.<ref name=nswshr-1750-15>River Murray Commission 1928</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nConstruction of the weir took seventeen years with the reservoir being completed and officially opened by the Right Honourable Lord Gowrie, Governor of NSW, on 21 November 1936 and a plaque on the northern pier of the dam commemorates the occasion. The Bethanga Bridge was evidently constructed in the middle of this period, probably when water backing-up behind the rising dam wall, began to reach the low level bridge at Bethanga.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThree engineers of note were involved in formulating the agreement, [[Ernest de Burgh]], the Chief Engineer of the Water Supply Branch of the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]], J. S. Detheridge the Commissioner, State Rivers and Water Supply of Victoria, and G. Stewart in South Australia. The initial designs for Hume Dam were prepared by de Burgh and Detheridge. NSW was responsible for construction of the concrete dam and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria was responsible for the southern earth embankments.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nAnother Victorian engineer, Ettore Checchi (1853-1946) was closely connected with the Hume Dam project in the 1920s and 30s. However, as his skills were with hydrographic work, it is unclear what contribution he had to the associated structures such as Bethanga Bridge. The State Rivers and Water supply Commission undertook at least some of the Hume Weir works in conjunction with the NSW Public Works Department. The [[River Murray Commission]] evidently had an overriding supervision of the works, but engineering and design details were left to the established public works engineers in the two states.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe heavy cost of Victoria's irrigation infrastructure lead to a parliamentary inquiry into the Commission's finances in 1928, and recommendations against further irrigation investment in an era of low export returns from primary produce. However, the Hume scheme appears to have been immune to any cuts due to the State - Federal agreement and advanced stage of the project. The NSW Department of Public Works carried out modifications between 1950 and 1961 to enlarge the dam to about twice its original size to the present capacity of {{convert|3038|GL|e9impgal e9USgal}} to accommodate diverted water from the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n===The place===\nAs a result of the construction of the weir, the water level in the Murray River backed up behind the dam to permanently inundate the floodplain, which was up to several kilometres wide in many places.<ref name=nswshr-1750/> Although confirmation of the construction authority is yet to be found, there is later evidence in the form of lantern slides showing the construction of the bridge and clearly intended for public presentation, that the bridge was substantially the work of the SRWSC.<ref name=SWRSC>SRWSC collection, [[State Library of Victoria]], Pictures Collection.</ref> The involvement of the NSW Public Works Department is also implied by photographs of components fabricated by Charles Ruwolt and Sons held by Museum Victoria. It is therefore very likely that the New South Wales Public Works Department and Victorian State Rivers and Water supply commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction, as was the case with the Hume Dam itself.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge is roughly contemporary with and is similar in design to the [[Yarrawonga, Victoria|Yarrawonga]] Bridge at [[Lake Mulwala]], which was designed by NSW [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] Engineer Percy Allen and constructed in 1924, also as a result of the creation of an artificial lake on the Murray River. The other prominent engineers involved in the Hume Project, Ettore Checchi, Ernest deBurgh, and J. S. Detheridge, were water supply engineers or had ceased to be involved when the bridge was built.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThere was a pattern in NSW/Victoria relationships over the Murray River border for NSW to design Murray River bridges, and Victoria to built them. Other examples of the arrangement can be found in the [[Swan Hill]] bridge and many timber bridges. Bethanga Bridge is similar to other large NSW bridges such as the Hawkesbury bridges, and uncharacteristic of Victorian bridge design practice.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe sequence of SRWSC lantern slides show the progressive construction of the Bethanga Bridge. Construction commenced in 1927 with clearance of the foundation sites and piling. By 1928 the piers were well under way and staging commenced from each bank. By 1929 all the piers were in place and waters had risen to the base of the piers. Erection of the trusses was underway. Falsework of underslung, divided Warren-type, metal trusses supported on three intermediate steel lattice towers, were used as staging for erecting the Pratt trusses. These were assembled in situ with the use of a travelling crane running across the falsework and hot riveting of preformed, punched and cut angle and flat section steel. As the permanent trusses were completed the staging was dismantled and moved on to the next span.<ref name=SWRSC/> Steel work for the bridge was fabricated at least in part, by Vickers Ruwolt of Burnley Melbourne. Photographs of components such as the truss members and bearings are in the collection of Museum Victoria. At least one of the main trusses was trial assembled at Vickers Ruwolt's Burnley works, probably one of the largest structures to be erected in this fashion.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge was clearly seen as a landmark and complementary to the Hume Dam itself in terms of national pride and potential tourist value. The State Rivers documented the bridge's construction and produced a series of lantern slides showing progress. A number of hand coloured slides and images were produced of the finished bridge to show it at its most impressive. The Victorian Railways also produced its own series of photographs in the 1940s and 50s presenting the bridge as part of a dramatic landscape and engineering achievement, probably for promoting tourist visits(by train) to the region. The bridge has been included in several Postcard series of the natural and man-made features of Albury in the 1950s and 60s under titles such as ''A Souvenir of Beautiful Albury''.<ref name=nswshr-1750/><ref name=SWRSC/> The bridge was constructed at a cost of {{circa}}&nbsp;[[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]194,000{{spaced endash}}210,000.<ref name=EA>{{cite web |url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/Bethanga%20Bridge.Nomination.V5.Sept%202015.docx.pdf |title=Nomination for Recognition of the Bethanga Bridge |work=EHA Heritage Recognition Program |publisher=[[Engineers Australia]] |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|13.7|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side was constructed in 1963 as part of the upgrading of the Hume Dam.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe town of [[Bellbridge, Victoria|Bellbridge]] at the southern end of the bridge, was created to replace facilities inundated by the reservoir. The bridge is currently managed by River Murray Water, although it is understood that the RTA, [[VicRoads]] and River Murray Water are negotiating on the future management responsibility for the bridge. A current {{convert|33|t|ST LT|0|adj=on}} load limit applies and recent tenders have been advertised for the cleaning and repainting of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1750-16>Advertisement for Bethanga Bridge Rehabilitation VicRoads tenders 5858</ref><ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe Bethanga Bridge is a road bridge over a flooded section of a Murray River valley that now forms part of the Hume Dam. The bridge consists of nine [[Span (architecture)|spans]] of {{convert|82|m|ft|0}}, each span being supported between double reinforced concrete [[Pylon (architecture)|pylons]] by a riveted steel camel back Pratt [[truss]] plus a {{convert|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} approach span on the New South Wales side. The overall span is {{convert|752|m|ft|0}}. The road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with the current concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. The road deck is {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}} wide. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam. In 2005 the waffle slab decking was replaced to raise ther load capacity, new guard rails were installed and the NSW approach to the bridge was widened for safety reasons. These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nBethanga Bridge comprises riveted steel [[Pratt truss|Pratt through trusses]] on multiple reinforced concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and reinforced concrete \"[[waffle slab]]\" deck on steel beams. There are nine identical principle spans of arched upper cord giving a truss variable depth. This form is also known as \"Hog-backed\" Camel-back\" and \"Parker\" truss in the USA. There are overhead diagonally braced frames and under deck diagonal \"X\" bracing between riveted plate cross girder beams. The short approach span on the NSW side has RSJ beams with straight transverse cross-braces. The main truss spans have ten [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with nine vertical compression chords and eight diagonal tension chords.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is on the southern bank of the river. All structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales. Because of its unique location, over the waters of a dam with the border running down the centre of the body of water, the Bethanga Bridge is the only built structure shared by both New South Wales and Victoria and listed on both the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]<ref name=nswshr-1750/> and the [[Victorian Heritage Register|Victorian Heritage Database]].<ref name=\"VHD\">{{cite VHD|12738|Bethanga Bridge|hr=12738|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nThe road deck was initially timber but was replaced in 1961 with a concrete [[waffle slab]] deck. In 1961 the bridge deck and truss structure was also raised by {{convert|300|mm|in|0}} in response to the upgrading of Hume Dam and works to increase the storage capacity of the dam. In 2005 the [[waffle slab]] decking was replaced to raise the load capacity, new guard rails were installed and the NSW approach to the bridge was widened for safety reasons. These 2005 works were undertaken with the joint advice and approval of Heritage Victoria and the NSW Heritage Office.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Pratt truss was an American style bridge truss that began the tide of change from British to American bridge technology in the nineteenth century. The Bethanga example comes from a period when Pratt trusses were an established design alternative, favoured by railways but generally shunned in Victorian road bridge design. It is a type of truss in which vertical web members are in compression and diagonal web members in tension. Many possible configurations include pitched, flat, or camelback top chords. It may be recognised by diagonal members which appear to form a \"V\" shape toward the centre of the truss when viewed in profile. Variations include the Baltimore truss and Pennsylvania truss. Elaboration in the form of variable depth from sloping upper chords as in the Camel-back arrangement, reduced the amount of steel required, and also dead weight for a similar strength. The Pratt truss compares to Warren truss and Howe designs in the different compression and tension arrangements of diagonal and vertical members. It was named for Thomas W. and Caleb Pratt (Boston railway engineers), who were issued a patent for a truss bearing their name in April 1844.<ref>Waddell 1891; Hughes Trueman Reinhold 1998, RTA NSW.</ref>\n\nThe overall length is given in VicRoads inventory as {{convert|733|m|ft|0}} although a deck length of {{convert|752.4|m|ft|0}} and total length of {{convert|750|m|ft|0}} in their inspection system appears more probable. The nine truss spans are each {{convert|82|m|ft|0}} with the NSW approach span being {{convert|12.5|m|0}}; clear height is {{convert|25|m|ft|0}} and width {{convert|7.7|m|ft|0}}. Concrete endposts frame the entry to the bridge. The construction date is cast in the one end post.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe original wooden road surface has been raised once and twice replaced, the railings replaced and the NSW approach modified. Nevertheless, Bethanga Bridge remains substantially the same structure erected in the 1920s.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\n\nBethanga Bridge was built between 1927 and 1930 as a joint venture between New South Wales and Victoria as part of the Hume Dam project as a key element of the River Murray Waters Agreement put in place in 1915 by the Victorian, New South Wales, South Australian and Federal governments to regulate the flow of the Murray River as a provision against drought and to ensure that the three states received their agreed share of water.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe use of Pratt trusses is unusual in Victoria, not being readily taken up as a viable bridge design. However they are more common in New South Wales. The use of the Pratt truss in this instance reflects the mode of construction employed during the construction of the Hume Dam whereby the New South Wales Department of Public Works and the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission were jointly responsible for the design and construction of the bridge. The bridge was designed in New South Wales by Department of Main Roads engineer Percy Allen and the trusses were built by Vickers Ruwolt in Melbourne.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe Murray River boundary between New South Wales and Victoria is the top of the southern bank of the river. As such all structures of the river are considered to be in New South Wales.

It is also of historical significance for its associations with The River Murray Waters Agreement and the River Murray Commission which had the task of putting the agreement into effect. The Agreement was a landmark document that drew on the cooperation of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to regulate the flow of the Murray River. The bridge reflects the engineering and design approaches of the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission and New South Wales Public Works Department in the late 1920s and the influence of American engineering Practice in the use of the Pratt truss. The bridge is also a significanc marker of the anticipated development that the new Hume Weir was expected to bring to the region, serving, as it did, only a few small farming communities and the copper and gold mining areas of Bethanga and Talarno, which were already in steep decline at the time the bridge was completed.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of technical significance for the unusual use in Victoria of Pratt trusses, a predominantly NSW technology based on American engineering practice . The Pratt truss was frequently used in New South Wales but this represents a rare example of its use in Victoria. The use of this system in this instance, its design by New South Wales and construction by Victoria, also represents the cooperation of New South Wales and Victoria in the development and ongoing use of major infrastructure. Bethanga Bridge is a representative example of Pratt Truss design displaying the main characteristics at a scale that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design over long spans and of its repetition to create a bridge of considerable overall length. Its construction methods are also of note in the use of staged construction from abutments along temporary underslung Warren trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\nThe bridge is of aesthetic significance for its dramatic rural setting over a wide expanse of water (when lake levels are high) and occasionally at great heights over broad river flats (when the lake is down). It is also of aesthetic significance for the vast scale and length and the rhythmic patterning of repeated geometric motifs of the trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nBethanga Bridge is of local social significance as an important local tourism destination and as the main link between the Bethanga/[[Granya]] region and the regional centre of [[Albury-Wodonga]] .<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAs a major bridge built by other than a state road or rail authority, Bethanga Bridge is rare and is the most substantial bridge erected by water authorities. It is the only built structure shared by NSW and Victoria.<ref name=nswshr-1750/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nBethanga Bridge Stevage.jpeg|Bethanga Bridge in 2014.\nLake Hume - Bethanga Bridge at Bellbridge on the Murray River - 6502.jpg|Bethanga Bridge in 2007, during drought.\nBethanga Bridge 2010 002.JPG|Bethanga Bridge in 2010.\nLake Hume Bethanga Bridge 6498.jpg\nBethanga Bridge on the Murray River.jpg|Unknown date, from the NSW State Records.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Australia|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Truss bridge#Allan Truss|Allan truss bridge]]\n*[[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite NSW HD|4302002|Bethanga Bridge over the Murray River}}\n* {{cite web|author=Cridlebaugh, Bruce S.|date=|title=Bridge Basics|website=Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny  County,  Pennsylvania|url=http://pghbridges.com/basics.htm}}<!-- great linking by SHR -->\n* {{cite book|last=East|first=Ronald|date=1979|title=Checchi, Ettore (1853-1946), engineer}}\n* {{cite book|author=Hughes Trueman Reinhold|date=1998|title=Murray River Crossing Study}}\n* {{cite book|last=Philipp|first=June|date=1982|title=Poor Man's Diggings: Mining and Community at Bethanga, Victoria, 1875-1912}}\n* {{cite book|editor=Philipp, June|date=1993|title=The making of a mining community : Bethanga, Victoria, 1875-1885|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/27689928}}\n* {{cite book|author=River Murray Commission (Australia)|date=1928|title=Hume Reservoir, Australia|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22261182}}\n* {{cite book|author=VicRoads Bridge Design Files|date=1993|title=Drawing No 478282, 25/06/1993}}\n* {{cite book|author=Waddell, J.
