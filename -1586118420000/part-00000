{"title_page": "History of New England", "text_new": "{{See also|Colonial history of the United States|Timeline of Colonial America}}\n\nThe '''history of New England''' pertains to the [[New England]] region of the United States. New England is the oldest clearly defined region of the United States, and it predates the [[American Revolution]] by more than 150 years. The English [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] were [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution in England who established the [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620, the first colony in New England and the second in America. A large influx of Puritans populated the greater region during the [[Puritan migration to New England (1620\u20131640)]], largely in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] area. Farming, fishing, and lumbering prospered, as did whaling and sea trading.\n\nNew England writers and events in the region helped launch and sustain the [[American War of Independence]], which began when fighting erupted between British troops and Massachusetts militia in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. The region later became a stronghold of the conservative [[Federalist Party]].\n\nBy the 1840s, New England was the center of the American [[anti-slavery movement]] and was the leading force in American literature and higher education. It was at the center of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in America, with many [[textile mill]]s and machine shops operating by 1830. The region was the manufacturing center of the entire United States for much of the nineteenth century, and it played an important role during and after the [[American Civil War]] as a fervent intellectual, political, and cultural promoter of abolitionism and civil rights.\n\nManufacturing in the United States began to shift south and west during the 20th century, and New England experienced a sustained period of economic decline and de-industrialization. By the beginning of the 21st century, however, the region had become a center for technology, weapons manufacturing, scientific research, and financial services.\n\n==Pre-Colonial==\n{{main|Prehistory of New England}}\nNew England was inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes when the first colonists arrived, including the [[Abenaki]], the [[Penobscot people|Penobscots]], the [[Pequot]]s, the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]], and many others. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Europeans charted the New England coast, including [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], [[Jacques Cartier]], and [[John Cabot]] (known as Giovanni Caboto before being based in England). They referred to the region as [[Norumbega]], named for a fabled city that was supposed to exist there.\n\nPrior to the arrival of colonists, the Western Abenakis inhabited New Hampshire and Vermont, as well as parts of Quebec and western Maine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abenakination.org/history.html|title=Abenaki History|publisher=abenakination.org|accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Their principal town was [[Norridgewock]] in Maine.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6QZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Norridgewock+history&source=bl&ots=5b_5Pcgg_c&sig=NLRILpDWZpXYz1K1hv3kJJUeI6U&hl=en&ei=__KQTa4g74XRAYWn2cQO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The History of Norridgewock|author=Allen, William|year=1849|location=Norridgewock ME|publisher=Edward J.

The Wampanoags occupied southeastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket; the Pocumtucks were in Western Massachusetts. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] occupied most of Rhode Island, particularly around [[Narragansett Bay]].\n\nThe Connecticut region was inhabited by the Mohegan and Pequot tribes prior to colonization. The [[Connecticut River Valley]] linked different tribes in cultural, linguistic, and political ways.<ref name=\"PVMA1\">Bain, Angela Goebel; Manring, Lynne; and Mathews, Barbara. ''Native Peoples in New England''. Retrieved July 21, 2010, from Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association.</ref> The tribes grew maize, tobacco, kidney beans, squash, and [[Jerusalem artichoke]].

The purpose of both was to claim land for England and to establish trade.\n\nUnder the charters, the territory allocated was defined as follows:\n#'''Virginia Company of London''': All land within {{convert|100|mi}} from the coast, including islands, and implying a westward limit of {{convert|100|mi}}, between 34 degrees (Cape Fear, North Carolina) and 41 degrees (Long Island Sound, New York) north latitude.<ref name=\"PAULLIN1\"/><ref name=\"SWINDLER1\"/>\n#'''Virginia Company of Plymouth''': All land within {{convert|100|mi}} from the coast, including islands, and implying a westward limit of {{convert|100|mi}}, between 38 degrees (Chesapeake Bay, Virginia) and 45 degrees (border between Canada and Maine) north latitude.<ref name=\"PAULLIN1\"/><ref name=\"SWINDLER1\"/> Its charter included land extending as far as northern Maine.\n\nThese were privately funded proprietary ventures, and the purpose of each was to claim land for England, establish trade, and return a profit. The London Company successfully established a colony in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. The Plymouth Company did not fulfill its charter, but the region chartered to it was named \"New England\" by Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown]] in his account of two voyages there, published as ''[[A Description of New England]]''.\n\n===Plymouth Colony (1620\u20131643)===\n{{main|Plymouth Colony}}\nThe name \"New England\" was officially sanctioned on November 3, 1620 when the charter of the Plymouth Company was replaced by a royal charter for the [[Plymouth Council for New England]], a joint stock company established to colonize and govern the region. In December 1620, the permanent settlement of [[Plymouth Colony]] was established by the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], English Puritan separatists who arrived on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. They held a feast of gratitude which became part of the American tradition of [[Thanksgiving]]. Plymouth Colony had a small population and size, and it was absorbed into [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1691.\n\n===Massachusetts Bay===\n{{Main|Massachusetts Bay Colony}}\nPuritans began to [[Puritan migration to New England (1620\u201340)|immigrate from England]] in large numbers, and they established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1629 with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the Church of England by creating a new, pure church in the New World. By 1640, 20,000 had arrived, although many died soon after arrival.\n\nThe Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and politically innovative culture that still influences the United States.<ref>Ernest Lee Tuveson, ''Redeemer nation: the idea of America's millennial role'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980)</ref> They fled England and attempted to create a \"nation of saints\" or a \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" in America, a community designed to be an example for all of Europe.\n\n===Rhode Island and Connecticut===\n{{main|Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Connecticut Colony}}\n[[Image:New England Town Lines and Borders in 1700.png|thumb|right|300px|Incorporated Towns in New England as they appeared around 1700]]\n[[Roger Williams]] preached religious toleration, separation of Church and State, and a complete break from the Church of England. He was banished from Massachusetts for his theological views and led a group south to found [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636. It merged with other settlements to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which became a haven for Baptists, Quakers, Jews, and others, including [[Anne Hutchinson]] who had been banished during the [[Antinomian Controversy]].<ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref>\n\nOn March 3, 1636, the [[Connecticut Colony]] was granted a charter and established its own government, absorbing the nearby [[New Haven Colony]]. Vermont was still unsettled, and the territories of New Hampshire and Maine were governed by Massachusetts.\n\n===The Dominion of New England (1686&ndash;1689)===\n{{main|Dominion of New England}}\nKing [[James II of England]] became concerned about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies, in particular their self-governing charters, open flouting of the [[Navigation Acts]], and increasing military power. He decreed the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1686, an administrative union of all the New England colonies, and the [[Province of New York]] and the [[Province of New Jersey]] were added into it two years later. The union was imposed upon the colonies and removed nearly all the leaders who had been elected by the colonists themselves, and it was highly unpopular as a result. The Connecticut Colony refused to deliver their charter to dominion Governor [[Edmund Andros]] in 1687, so he sent an armed contingent to seize it. According to tradition, the colonists hid the charter inside the [[Charter Oak]] tree. King James was removed from the throne in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1689, and Andros was arrested and sent back to England by the colonists during the [[1689 Boston revolt]].<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h546.html Dominion of New England<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of the British and French dominions in North America, drawn by order of the British government in 1755, showing what that government then conceded as New England (9138601070).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of the British and French dominions in North America in 1755, showing what the English considered New England]]\n\n=== Government of the colonies ===\nMost of the colonial charters were significantly modified after the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1689, with the appointment of royal governors to nearly every colony. An uneasy tension existed between the Royal Governors and the officials who had been elected by the colonists themselves. The governors wanted essentially unlimited powers, and the different layers of elected officials resisted as best they could. In most cases, towns continued operating as self-governing bodies, as they had done previously, and ignored the royal governors whenever possible. The New England colonies were not formally united again until 1776, when all [[thirteen colonies]] declared themselves independent states in a larger union called the [[United States of America]].\n\n=== Population and demographics ===\nThe regional economy grew rapidly in the 17th century, thanks to heavy immigration, high birth rates, low death rates, and an abundance of inexpensive farmland.<ref>Daniel Scott Smith, \"The Demographic History of Colonial New England,\" ''Journal of Economic History,''  32 (March 1972), 165-183 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2117183 in JSTOR]</ref>  The population grew from 3,000 in 1630 to 14,000 in 1640, 33,000 in 1660, 68,000 in 1680, and 91,000 in 1700. Between 1630 and 1643, about 20,000 Puritans arrived, settling mostly near Boston; after 1643, fewer than 50 immigrants arrived per year. The average size of a family 1660-1700 was 7.1 children; the birth rate was 49 babies per year per thousand people, and the death rate was about 22 deaths per year per thousand people. About 27 percent of the population was composed of men between 16 and 60 years old.<ref>Terry L.

The region's economy gradually began to focus on crafts and trade, in contrast to the Southern colonies whose agrarian economy focused more heavily on foreign and domestic trade.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |page = 112 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref>\n\nNew England fulfilled the economic expectations of its Puritan founders. The Puritan economy was based on the efforts of self-supporting farmsteads which traded only for goods that they could not produce themselves, unlike the cash crop-oriented plantations of the Chesapeake region.<ref>Anne Mackin, ''Americans and their land: the house built on abundance'' (University of Michigan Press, 2006) p 29</ref> New England became an important mercantile and shipbuilding center, along with agriculture, fishing, and logging, serving as the hub for trading between the southern colonies and Europe.<ref name=\"ciment\">James Ciment, ed. ''Colonial America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History'', 2005.</ref>\n\nThe region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the colonies fostered economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, inns, and ferries. They gave bounties and monopolies to sawmills, grist mills, iron mills, fulling mills (which treated cloth), salt works, and glassworks. Most important, colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights. Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the region, as the Puritans and [[Yankee]]s endorsed the \"[[Protestant Work Ethic]]\" which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling.<ref>Margaret Alan Newell, \"The Birth of New England in the Atlantic Economy: From its Beginning to 1770, in Peter Temin, ed., ''Engines of Enterprise: An Economic History of New England'' (Harvard UP, 2000), pp. 11-68, esp. p. 41</ref>\n\nNew England conducted a robust trade within the English domain in the mid-18th century. They exported pickled beef and pork to the Caribbean, onions and potatoes from the Connecticut Valley, northern pine and oak staves from which the planters constructed containers to ship their sugar and molasses, [[Narragansett Pacer]]s from Rhode Island, and \"plugs\" to run sugar mills.<ref>{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = Mentor |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu/page/199 199\u2013200] |url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu|url-access = registration |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of growth were widely distributed, with even farm laborers better off at the end of the colonial period. The growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands farther west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages went up steadily before 1775, and new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring. The region bordered New France, and the British poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads, and pay colonial soldiers in several wars. The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade, ship building, and whaling after 1780. These factors combined with growing urban markets for farm products and allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.<ref>[[Gloria L. Main]] and Jackson T.

At first, the rudiments of literacy and arithmetic were taught inside the family. By the mid-19th century, the role of the schools had expanded to such an extent that many of the educational tasks traditionally handled by parents became the responsibility of the schools.<ref>Lawrence Cremin ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607-1783'' (Harper & Row, 1970)</ref><ref>Maris A.

[[Hopkins School]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] was another. By the 1780s, most had been replaced by private academies. By the early 19th century, New England operated a network of elite private high schools (now called \"prep schools\") typified by [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Andover Academy]] (1778), [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] (1781), and [[Deerfield Academy]] (1797).

[[Yale University|Yale College]] was founded in 1701 and was relocated to New Haven in 1716.

New Englanders were very proud of their political freedoms and local democracy, which they felt was increasingly threatened by the English government. The main grievance was taxation, which colonists argued could only be imposed by their own legislatures and not by the Parliament in London. Their political cry was \"[[no taxation without representation]].\"\n\n[[File:Massachusetts Revolutionary War loan certificate September 1777.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Certificate of government of Massachusetts Bay acknowledging loan of \u00a320 to state treasury 1777]]\n\nA ship was planning to land tea in Boston on December 16, 1773, and Patriots associated with the [[Sons of Liberty]] raided the ship and dumped all the tea into the harbor. This [[Boston Tea Party]] outraged British officials, and the King and Parliament decided to punish Massachusetts, passing the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774. This closed the port of Boston, the economic lifeblood of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and it ended self-government, putting the people under military rule.\n\nThe Patriots set up a shadow government which the British Army attacked on April 18, 1775 at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. British troops were forced back to Boston by the local militias on the 19th in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] where the famous \"[[shot heard 'round the world]]\" was fired. The British army controlled only the city of Boston, and it was quickly [[Siege of Boston|brought under siege]]. The Continental Congress took control of the war, sending General [[George Washington]] to take charge. He forced the British to evacuate in March 1776. After that, the main warfare moved south, but the British made repeated raids along the coast, seizing [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and parts of Maine for a while.<ref>David Hackett Fischer, ''Paul Revere's Ride'' (1994)</ref>\n\n===Early national period===\n\nAfter independence, New England ceased to be a unified political unit but remained a defined historical and cultural region consisting of its constituent states. By 1784, all of the states in the region had introduced the gradual abolition of slavery, with Vermont and Massachusetts introducing total abolition in 1777 and 1783, respectively.<ref>Douglas Harper, [http://www.slavenorth.com/newhampshire.htm \"Slavery in New Hampshire\" (2003)]</ref> During the [[War of 1812]], some Federalists considered seceding from the Union, and some New England merchants opposed the war with Britain because she was their greatest trading partner.

Massachusetts and Connecticut were among the last refuges of the [[Federalist Party]], and New England became the strongest bastion of the new [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] when the [[Second Party System]] began in the 1830s. Leading statesmen hailed from the region, including conservative Whig orator [[Daniel Webster]].\n\nNew England proved to be the center of the strongest [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment in the country, along with areas that were settled from New England, such as upstate New York, Ohio's [[Western Reserve]], and the states of [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Abolitionists [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]] were New Englanders, and the region was home to anti-slavery politicians [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Charles Sumner]], and [[John P. Hale]]. The anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed in the 1850s, and all of New England became strongly Republican, including areas that had previously been strongholds for the Whig and Democrat Parties. The region remained Republican until the early 20th century, when immigration turned the states of southern New England towards the Democrats.\n\nThe 1860 Census showed that 32 of the 100 largest cities in the country were in New England, as well as the most highly educated. New England produced numerous literary and intellectual figures in the nineteenth century, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], [[George Bancroft]], [[William H. Prescott]], and others.<ref>Van Wyck Brooks, ''The flowering of New England, 1815-1865'' (1941)</ref>\n\n===Industrialization===\n[[Image:Pawtucket slater mill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Slater Mill Historic Site]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]].]]\nNew England was an early center of the industrial revolution. The [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] was the first cotton mill in America, founded in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] in 1787,<ref>William R. Bagnall, ''The Textile Industries of the United States: Including Sketches and Notices of Cotton, Woolen, Silk, and Linen Manufacturers in the Colonial Period.'' (1893) Vol. I. Pg 97.</ref> and was considered the largest cotton mill of its time. Technological developments and achievements from the Manufactory led to the development of other, more advanced cotton mills, including [[Slater Mill]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. Several [[textile mill]]s were already underway during the time. Towns became famed as centers of the textile industry, such as [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]], and [[Lewiston, Maine]], following models from Slater Mill and the Beverly Cotton Manufactory.\n\nThe textile manufacturing in New England was growing rapidly, which caused a shortage of workers. Recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories, and thousands of farm girls left their rural homes in New England to work in the mills between 1830 and 1860, hoping to aid their families financially, save up for marriage, and widen their horizons. They also left their homes due to population pressures to look for opportunities in expanding New England cities. The majority of female workers came from rural farming towns in northern New England. Immigration also grew along with the growth of the textile industry\u2014but the number of young women working in the mills decreased as the number of Irish workers increased.<ref>Thomas Dublin, \"Lowell Millhands\" in ''Transforming Women's Work'' (Cornell UP) pp 77-118.</ref>\n\n====Agriculture====\nAs New England's urban, industrial economy transformed from the beginning of the early national period (~1790) to the middle of the nineteenth century, so too did its agricultural economy. At the beginning of this period, when the United States was just emerging from its colonial past, the agricultural landscape of New England was defined overwhelmingly by subsistence farming.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\">Bidwell, p. 684.</ref>  The primary crops produced were wheat, barley, rye, oats, turnips, parsnips, carrots, onions, cucumbers, beets, corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, and melons.<ref>Kelsey, p. 1.</ref>  Because there was not a sufficiently large New England-based home market for agricultural products due to the absence of a large nonagricultural population, New England farmers by and large had no incentive to commercialize their farms.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\"/>  Thus, as farmers could not find very many markets nearby to sell to, they generally could not earn enough income with which to buy many new products for themselves. This not only meant that farmers would largely produce their own food, but also that they tended to produce their own furniture, clothing, and soap, among other household items.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\"/>  Hence, according to historian Percy Bidwell, at the onset of the early national period, much of the New England agricultural economy was characterized by a \u201clack of exchange; lack of differentiation of employments or division of labor; the absence of progress in agricultural methods; a relatively low standard of living; emigration and social stagnation.\u201d<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\"/>   As Bidwell writes, the farming in New England at this time was \u201cpractically uniform\u201d with many farmers distributing their land \u201cin about the same proportions into pasturage, woodland, and tillage, and raised about the same crops and kept about the same kind and quantity of stock\u201d as other farmers.<ref>Bidwell, p. 688.</ref>  This situation would, however, be radically different by 1850, by which time a highly specialized agricultural economy producing a host of new and differentiated products had emerged. There were two factors that were primarily responsible for the revolutionary changes in the agricultural economy of New England during the period from 1790 to 1850: (1) The rise of the manufacturing industry in New England (industrialization), and (2) agricultural competition from the western states.<ref>Kelsey, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the industrial jobs created in New England's towns and cities affected the agricultural economy profoundly by generating a rapidly growing nonagricultural, urbanizing population. The farmers finally had a nearby market to which they could sell their crops, and thus an opportunity to obtain incomes beyond what they produced for subsistence.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 685\">Bidwell, p. 685.</ref> This new market enabled farmers to make their farms more productive.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 685\"/>  There was a resultant move away from subsistence farming toward the production of specialized crops. The demands of the consumers of the crops, whether factories or individuals, now determined the kinds of crops that each farm cultivated. Potash, pearlash, charcoal, and fuel wood were among the agricultural products that were produced in greater quantities during this time.<ref>Gates, p. 39-40.</ref>  The increasing specialization of agriculture even led to production of tobacco, a predominantly southern crop, from central Connecticut to northern Massachusetts, where natural conditions were amenable to its growth.<ref>Bidwell, p. 689.</ref>  Many agricultural societies were formed to promote improved farming,<ref>Russell, p. vi.</ref> and they did so by dispensing information on new technological innovations such as the cast-iron plough, which rapidly replaced the wooden plough by the 1830s, as well as mowing machines and horse-rakes.<ref>Bidwell, p. 687.</ref>  Another important result of the manufacturing boom in New England was the new abundance of cheap products that formerly had to be produced on the farm. For example, myriad new mills produced inexpensive textiles, and it now made more economic sense for many farm women to purchase these textiles rather than spin and weave them at home. Women consequently found new employment elsewhere, typically at the mills, many of which had a shortage of workers, and they began to earn cash incomes.<ref name=\"Russell, p. 337\">Russell, p. 337.</ref>\n\nThe agricultural competition that emerged from the western states due to improvements in transportation (e.g., railroads and steamboats) also helped shape agriculture in New England. Competition from the western states was principally responsible for the decline in local pork production and cattle-fattening, as well as that in wheat production.<ref name=\"Russell, p. 337\"/>  New England farmers now aimed to produce goods with which western farmers could not compete. Consequently, many New England farms came to specialize in \u201chighly perishable and bulky produce,\u201d according to historian Darwin Kelsey. These crops included milk, butter, potatoes, and broomcorn.<ref>Kelsey, p. 5.</ref>  Thus, both the rise of manufacturing during the industrial revolution and the rise of western competition generated substantial agricultural specialization.\n\nThe largely differentiated agricultural landscape of the New England of 1850<ref>Kelsey, p. 6.</ref>  was distinct from the subsistence-dominated landscape that existed 40\u201360 years prior. This period of time, therefore, was not only noteworthy in terms of New England's industrial revolution, but also in terms of New England's agricultural revolution.\nMIT economic historian Peter Temin has pointed out that the \u201ctransformation of the New England economy in the middle fifty years of the nineteenth century was comparable in scope and intensity to the Asian \u2018miracles\u2019 of Korea and Taiwan in the half-century since World War II.\u201d<ref>Temin, p. 109.</ref>  The extensive changes in agriculture that occurred were an important aspect of this economic process.\n\n[[Image:Autumn in New Hampshire.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Autumn in New England|Autumn]] in [[Grafton County, New Hampshire]], a notable feature of New England]] There have been waves of immigration from Ireland, Quebec, Italy, Portugal, Asia, [[Latin America]], Africa, other parts of the United States, and elsewhere.\n\n===New England and political thought===\n[[Image:Thoreau1967stamp.jpg|thumb|300px|The writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]] influenced thinkers as diverse as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as the modern [[Environmental movement]]]]\n\nDuring the colonial period and the early years of the American republic, New England leaders like [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]], [[John Adams]], and [[Samuel Adams]] joined Patriots in Philadelphia and Virginia to define [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], and lead the colonies to a war for independence against Great Britain.

New York's leading banker, [[J. P. Morgan]], had grown up in Hartford and had a strong interest in the New England economy. Starting in the 1890s Morgan began financing the major New England railroads, such as the New Haven and the [[Boston and Maine Corporation|Boston and Maine]], dividing territory so they would not compete. In 1903 he brought in [[Charles Sanger Mellen|Charles Mellen]] as president of the New Haven (1903-1913). The goal, richly supported by Morgan's financing, was to purchase and consolidate the main railway lines of New England, merge their operations, lower their costs, electrify the heavily used routes, and modernize the system. With less competition and lower costs, there supposedly would be higher profits. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including streetcars, freight steamers, passenger steamships, and a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over {{convert|2000|mi}} of track, with 120,000 employees, and practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City.\n\nMorgan's quest for monopoly angered reformers during the [[Progressive Era]], most notably Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]], who fought the New Haven for years. Mellen's abrasive tactics alienated public opinion, led to high prices for acquisitions and to costly construction. The accident rate rose when efforts were made to save on maintenance costs. Debt soared from $14 million in 1903 to $242 million in 1913. Also in 1913 it was hit by an anti-trust lawsuit by the federal government and was forced to give up its trolley systems.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vincent P.

The line went bankrupt in 1935, was reorganized and reduced in scope, went bankrupt again in 1961, and in 1969 was merged into the Penn Central system, which itself went bankrupt. The remnants of the system are now part of Conrail.<ref>John L.

New England is the oldest clearly defined region of the United States, and it predates the [[American Revolution]] by more than 150 years. The English [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] were [[Puritans]] fleeing religious persecution in England who established the [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620, the first colony in New England and the second in America. A large influx of Puritans populated the greater region during the [[Puritan migration to New England (1620\u20131640)]], largely in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] area. Farming, fishing, and lumbering prospered, as did whaling and sea trading.\n\nNew England writers and events in the region helped launch and sustain the [[American War of Independence]], which began when fighting erupted between British troops and Massachusetts militia in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. The region later became a stronghold of the conservative [[Federalist Party]].\n\nBy the 1840s, New England was the center of the American [[anti-slavery movement]] and was the leading force in American literature and higher education. It was at the center of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in America, with many [[textile mill]]s and machine shops operating by 1830. The region was the manufacturing center of the entire United States for much of the nineteenth century, and it played an important role during and after the [[American Civil War]] as a fervent intellectual, political, and cultural promoter of abolitionism and civil rights.\n\nManufacturing in the United States began to shift south and west during the 20th century, and New England experienced a sustained period of economic decline and de-industrialization. By the beginning of the 21st century, however, the region had become a center for technology, weapons manufacturing, scientific research, and financial services.\n\n==Pre-Colonial==\n{{main|Prehistory of New England}}\nNew England was inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes when the first colonists arrived, including the [[Abenaki]], the [[Penobscot people|Penobscots]], the [[Pequot]]s, the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]], and many others. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Europeans charted the New England coast, including [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], [[Jacques Cartier]], and [[John Cabot]] (known as Giovanni Caboto before being based in England). They referred to the region as [[Norumbega]], named for a fabled city that was supposed to exist there.\n\nPrior to the arrival of colonists, the Western Abenakis inhabited New Hampshire and Vermont, as well as parts of Quebec and western Maine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abenakination.org/history.html|title=Abenaki History|publisher=abenakination.org|accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Their principal town was [[Norridgewock]] in Maine.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6QZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Norridgewock+history&source=bl&ots=5b_5Pcgg_c&sig=NLRILpDWZpXYz1K1hv3kJJUeI6U&hl=en&ei=__KQTa4g74XRAYWn2cQO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The History of Norridgewock|author=Allen, William|year=1849|location=Norridgewock ME|publisher=Edward J.

The London Company successfully established a colony in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. The Plymouth Company did not fulfill its charter, but the region chartered to it was named \"New England\" by Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown]] in his account of two voyages there, published as ''[[A Description of New England]]''.\n\n===Plymouth Colony (1620\u20131643)===\n{{main|Plymouth Colony}}\nThe name \"New England\" was officially sanctioned on November 3, 1620 when the charter of the Plymouth Company was replaced by a royal charter for the [[Plymouth Council for New England]], a joint stock company established to colonize and govern the region.

By 1640, 20,000 had arrived, although many died soon after arrival.\n\nThe Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and politically innovative culture that still influences the United States.<ref>Ernest Lee Tuveson, ''Redeemer nation: the idea of America's millennial role'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980)</ref> They fled England and attempted to create a \"nation of saints\" or a \"[[City upon a Hill]]\" in America, a community designed to be an example for all of Europe.\n\n===Rhode Island and Connecticut===\n{{main|Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Connecticut Colony}}\n[[Image:New England Town Lines and Borders in 1700.png|thumb|right|300px|Incorporated Towns in New England as they appeared around 1700]]\n[[Roger Williams]] preached religious toleration, separation of Church and State, and a complete break from the Church of England.

He decreed the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1686, an administrative union of all the New England colonies, and the [[Province of New York]] and the [[Province of New Jersey]] were added into it two years later. The union was imposed upon the colonies and removed nearly all the leaders who had been elected by the colonists themselves, and it was highly unpopular as a result. The Connecticut Colony refused to deliver their charter to dominion Governor [[Edmund Andros]] in 1687, so he sent an armed contingent to seize it. According to tradition, the colonists hid the charter inside the [[Charter Oak]] tree. King James was removed from the throne in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1689, and Andros was arrested and sent back to England by the colonists during the [[1689 Boston revolt]].<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h546.html Dominion of New England<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of the British and French dominions in North America, drawn by order of the British government in 1755, showing what that government then conceded as New England (9138601070).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of the British and French dominions in North America in 1755, showing what the English considered New England]]\n\n=== Government of the colonies ===\nMost of the colonial charters were significantly modified after the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1689, with the appointment of royal governors to nearly every colony. An uneasy tension existed between the Royal Governors and the officials who had been elected by the colonists themselves. The governors wanted essentially unlimited powers, and the different layers of elected officials resisted as best they could. In most cases, towns continued operating as self-governing bodies, as they had done previously, and ignored the royal governors whenever possible. The New England colonies were not formally united again until 1776, when all [[thirteen colonies]] declared themselves independent states in a larger union called the [[United States of America]].\n\n=== Population and demographics ===\nThe regional economy grew rapidly in the 17th century, thanks to heavy immigration, high birth rates, low death rates, and an abundance of inexpensive farmland.<ref>Daniel Scott Smith, \"The Demographic History of Colonial New England,\" ''Journal of Economic History,''  32 (March 1972), 165-183 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2117183 in JSTOR]</ref>  The population grew from 3,000 in 1630 to 14,000 in 1640, 33,000 in 1660, 68,000 in 1680, and 91,000 in 1700. Between 1630 and 1643, about 20,000 Puritans arrived, settling mostly near Boston; after 1643, fewer than 50 immigrants arrived per year. The average size of a family 1660-1700 was 7.1 children; the birth rate was 49 babies per year per thousand people, and the death rate was about 22 deaths per year per thousand people. About 27 percent of the population was composed of men between 16 and 60 years old.<ref>Terry L.

The region's economy gradually began to focus on crafts and trade, in contrast to the Southern colonies whose agrarian economy focused more heavily on foreign and domestic trade.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = [[Mentor]] |year = 1972 |location = New York City |page = 112 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref>\n\nNew England fulfilled the economic expectations of its Puritan founders. The Puritan economy was based on the efforts of self-supporting farmsteads which traded only for goods that they could not produce themselves, unlike the cash crop-oriented plantations of the Chesapeake region.<ref>Anne Mackin, ''Americans and their land: the house built on abundance'' (University of Michigan Press, 2006) p 29</ref> New England became an important mercantile and shipbuilding center, along with agriculture, fishing, and logging, serving as the hub for trading between the southern colonies and Europe.<ref name=\"ciment\">James Ciment, ed. ''Colonial America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History'', 2005.</ref>\n\nThe region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the colonies fostered economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, inns, and ferries. They gave bounties and monopolies to sawmills, grist mills, iron mills, fulling mills (which treated cloth), salt works, and glassworks. Most important, colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights. Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the region, as the Puritans and [[Yankee]]s endorsed the \"[[Protestant Work Ethic]]\" which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling.<ref>Margaret Alan Newell, \"The Birth of New England in the Atlantic Economy: From its Beginning to 1770, in Peter Temin, ed., ''Engines of Enterprise: An Economic History of New England'' (Harvard UP, 2000), pp. 11-68, esp. p. 41</ref>\n\nNew England conducted a robust trade within the English domain in the mid-18th century. They exported pickled beef and pork to the Caribbean, onions and potatoes from the Connecticut Valley, northern pine and oak staves from which the planters constructed containers to ship their sugar and molasses, [[Narragansett Pacer]]s from Rhode Island, and \"plugs\" to run sugar mills.<ref>{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = Mentor |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =[https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu/page/199 199\u2013200] |url =https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoft02samu|url-access = registration |doi = |id = |isbn = 0-451-62600-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe benefits of growth were widely distributed, with even farm laborers better off at the end of the colonial period. The growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands farther west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages went up steadily before 1775, and new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring. The region bordered New France, and the British poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads, and pay colonial soldiers in several wars. The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade, ship building, and whaling after 1780. These factors combined with growing urban markets for farm products and allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.<ref>[[Gloria L. Main]] and Jackson T.

At first, the rudiments of literacy and arithmetic were taught inside the family. By the mid-19th century, the role of the schools had expanded to such an extent that many of the educational tasks traditionally handled by parents became the responsibility of the schools.<ref>Lawrence Cremin ''American Education: The Colonial Experience, 1607-1783'' (Harper & Row, 1970)</ref><ref>Maris A.

[[Hopkins School]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] was another. By the 1780s, most had been replaced by private academies. By the early 19th century, New England operated a network of elite private high schools (now called \"prep schools\") typified by [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Andover Academy]] (1778), [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] (1781), and [[Deerfield Academy]] (1797).

[[Yale University|Yale College]] was founded in 1701 and was relocated to New Haven in 1716.

New Englanders were very proud of their political freedoms and local democracy, which they felt was increasingly threatened by the English government. The main grievance was taxation, which colonists argued could only be imposed by their own legislatures and not by the Parliament in London. Their political cry was \"[[no taxation without representation]].\"\n\n[[File:Massachusetts Revolutionary War loan certificate September 1777.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Certificate of government of Massachusetts Bay acknowledging loan of \u00a320 to state treasury 1777]]\n\nA ship was planning to land tea in Boston on December 16, 1773, and Patriots associated with the [[Sons of Liberty]] raided the ship and dumped all the tea into the harbor. This [[Boston Tea Party]] outraged British officials, and the King and Parliament decided to punish Massachusetts, passing the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774. This closed the port of Boston, the economic lifeblood of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and it ended self-government, putting the people under military rule.\n\nThe Patriots set up a shadow government which the British Army attacked on April 18, 1775 at [[Concord, Massachusetts]]. British troops were forced back to Boston by the local militias on the 19th in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] where the famous \"[[shot heard 'round the world]]\" was fired. The British army controlled only the city of Boston, and it was quickly [[Siege of Boston|brought under siege]]. The Continental Congress took control of the war, sending General [[George Washington]] to take charge. He forced the British to evacuate in March 1776. After that, the main warfare moved south, but the British made repeated raids along the coast, seizing [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and parts of Maine for a while.<ref>David Hackett Fischer, ''Paul Revere's Ride'' (1994)</ref>\n\n===Early national period===\n\nAfter independence, New England ceased to be a unified political unit but remained a defined historical and cultural region consisting of its constituent states. By 1784, all of the states in the region had introduced the gradual abolition of slavery, with Vermont and Massachusetts introducing total abolition in 1777 and 1783, respectively.<ref>Douglas Harper, [http://www.slavenorth.com/newhampshire.htm \"Slavery in New Hampshire\" (2003)]</ref> During the [[War of 1812]], some Federalists considered seceding from the Union, and some New England merchants opposed the war with Britain because she was their greatest trading partner.

The war ended triumphantly, and the Federalist Party was permanently discredited and faded away.<ref>Lawrence Delbert Cress, \"'Cool and Serious Reflection': Federalist Attitudes toward War in 1812,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 7#2 (1987), pp. 123-145 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3123456 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe territory of Maine was a part of Massachusetts, but it was admitted to the Union as an independent state in 1820 as part of the [[Missouri Compromise]]. Today, New England is defined as the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/411409/New-England|title=New England|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>\n\nNew England remained distinct from the other states in terms of politics, often going against the grain of the rest of the country. Massachusetts and Connecticut were among the last refuges of the [[Federalist Party]], and New England became the strongest bastion of the new [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] when the [[Second Party System]] began in the 1830s. Leading statesmen hailed from the region, including conservative Whig orator [[Daniel Webster]].\n\nNew England proved to be the center of the strongest [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment in the country, along with areas that were settled from New England, such as upstate New York, Ohio's [[Western Reserve]], and the states of [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Abolitionists [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]] were New Englanders, and the region was home to anti-slavery politicians [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Charles Sumner]], and [[John P. Hale]]. The anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed in the 1850s, and all of New England became strongly Republican, including areas that had previously been strongholds for the Whig and Democrat Parties. The region remained Republican until the early 20th century, when immigration turned the states of southern New England towards the Democrats.\n\nThe 1860 Census showed that 32 of the 100 largest cities in the country were in New England, as well as the most highly educated. New England produced numerous literary and intellectual figures in the nineteenth century, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], [[George Bancroft]], [[William H. Prescott]], and others.<ref>Van Wyck Brooks, ''The flowering of New England, 1815-1865'' (1941)</ref>\n\n===Industrialization===\n[[Image:Pawtucket slater mill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Slater Mill Historic Site]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]].]]\nNew England was an early center of the industrial revolution. The [[Beverly Cotton Manufactory]] was the first cotton mill in America, founded in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] in 1787,<ref>William R. Bagnall, ''The Textile Industries of the United States: Including Sketches and Notices of Cotton, Woolen, Silk, and Linen Manufacturers in the Colonial Period.'' (1893) Vol. I. Pg 97.</ref> and was considered the largest cotton mill of its time. Technological developments and achievements from the Manufactory led to the development of other, more advanced cotton mills, including [[Slater Mill]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]]. Several [[textile mill]]s were already underway during the time. Towns became famed as centers of the textile industry, such as [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]], and [[Lewiston, Maine]], following models from Slater Mill and the Beverly Cotton Manufactory.\n\nThe textile manufacturing in New England was growing rapidly, which caused a shortage of workers. Recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories, and thousands of farm girls left their rural homes in New England to work in the mills between 1830 and 1860, hoping to aid their families financially, save up for marriage, and widen their horizons. They also left their homes due to population pressures to look for opportunities in expanding New England cities. The majority of female workers came from rural farming towns in northern New England. Immigration also grew along with the growth of the textile industry\u2014but the number of young women working in the mills decreased as the number of Irish workers increased.<ref>Thomas Dublin, \"Lowell Millhands\" in ''Transforming Women's Work'' (Cornell UP) pp 77-118.</ref>\n\n====Agriculture====\nAs New England's urban, industrial economy transformed from the beginning of the early national period (~1790) to the middle of the nineteenth century, so too did its agricultural economy. At the beginning of this period, when the United States was just emerging from its colonial past, the agricultural landscape of New England was defined overwhelmingly by subsistence farming.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\">Bidwell, p. 684.</ref>  The primary crops produced were wheat, barley, rye, oats, turnips, parsnips, carrots, onions, cucumbers, beets, corn, beans, pumpkins, squashes, and melons.<ref>Kelsey, p. 1.</ref>  Because there was not a sufficiently large New England-based home market for agricultural products due to the absence of a large nonagricultural population, New England farmers by and large had no incentive to commercialize their farms.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\"/>  Thus, as farmers could not find very many markets nearby to sell to, they generally could not earn enough income with which to buy many new products for themselves. This not only meant that farmers would largely produce their own food, but also that they tended to produce their own furniture, clothing, and soap, among other household items.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\"/>  Hence, according to historian Percy Bidwell, at the onset of the early national period, much of the New England agricultural economy was characterized by a \u201clack of exchange; lack of differentiation of employments or division of labor; the absence of progress in agricultural methods; a relatively low standard of living; emigration and social stagnation.\u201d<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 684\"/>   As Bidwell writes, the farming in New England at this time was \u201cpractically uniform\u201d with many farmers distributing their land \u201cin about the same proportions into pasturage, woodland, and tillage, and raised about the same crops and kept about the same kind and quantity of stock\u201d as other farmers.<ref>Bidwell, p. 688.</ref>  This situation would, however, be radically different by 1850, by which time a highly specialized agricultural economy producing a host of new and differentiated products had emerged. There were two factors that were primarily responsible for the revolutionary changes in the agricultural economy of New England during the period from 1790 to 1850: (1) The rise of the manufacturing industry in New England (industrialization), and (2) agricultural competition from the western states.<ref>Kelsey, p. 4.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the industrial jobs created in New England's towns and cities affected the agricultural economy profoundly by generating a rapidly growing nonagricultural, urbanizing population. The farmers finally had a nearby market to which they could sell their crops, and thus an opportunity to obtain incomes beyond what they produced for subsistence.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 685\">Bidwell, p. 685.</ref> This new market enabled farmers to make their farms more productive.<ref name=\"Bidwell, p. 685\"/>  There was a resultant move away from subsistence farming toward the production of specialized crops. The demands of the consumers of the crops, whether factories or individuals, now determined the kinds of crops that each farm cultivated. Potash, pearlash, charcoal, and fuel wood were among the agricultural products that were produced in greater quantities during this time.<ref>Gates, p. 39-40.</ref>  The increasing specialization of agriculture even led to production of tobacco, a predominantly southern crop, from central Connecticut to northern Massachusetts, where natural conditions were amenable to its growth.<ref>Bidwell, p. 689.</ref>  Many agricultural societies were formed to promote improved farming,<ref>Russell, p. vi.</ref> and they did so by dispensing information on new technological innovations such as the cast-iron plough, which rapidly replaced the wooden plough by the 1830s, as well as mowing machines and horse-rakes.<ref>Bidwell, p. 687.</ref>  Another important result of the manufacturing boom in New England was the new abundance of cheap products that formerly had to be produced on the farm. For example, myriad new mills produced inexpensive textiles, and it now made more economic sense for many farm women to purchase these textiles rather than spin and weave them at home. Women consequently found new employment elsewhere, typically at the mills, many of which had a shortage of workers, and they began to earn cash incomes.<ref name=\"Russell, p. 337\">Russell, p. 337.</ref>\n\nThe agricultural competition that emerged from the western states due to improvements in transportation (e.g., railroads and steamboats) also helped shape agriculture in New England. Competition from the western states was principally responsible for the decline in local pork production and cattle-fattening, as well as that in wheat production.<ref name=\"Russell, p. 337\"/>  New England farmers now aimed to produce goods with which western farmers could not compete. Consequently, many New England farms came to specialize in \u201chighly perishable and bulky produce,\u201d according to historian Darwin Kelsey. These crops included milk, butter, potatoes, and broomcorn.<ref>Kelsey, p. 5.</ref>  Thus, both the rise of manufacturing during the industrial revolution and the rise of western competition generated substantial agricultural specialization.\n\nThe largely differentiated agricultural landscape of the New England of 1850<ref>Kelsey, p. 6.</ref>  was distinct from the subsistence-dominated landscape that existed 40\u201360 years prior. This period of time, therefore, was not only noteworthy in terms of New England's industrial revolution, but also in terms of New England's agricultural revolution.\nMIT economic historian Peter Temin has pointed out that the \u201ctransformation of the New England economy in the middle fifty years of the nineteenth century was comparable in scope and intensity to the Asian \u2018miracles\u2019 of Korea and Taiwan in the half-century since World War II.\u201d<ref>Temin, p. 109.</ref>  The extensive changes in agriculture that occurred were an important aspect of this economic process.\n\n[[Image:Autumn in New Hampshire.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Autumn in New England|Autumn]] in [[Grafton County, New Hampshire]], a notable feature of New England]] There have been waves of immigration from Ireland, Quebec, Italy, Portugal, Asia, [[Latin America]], Africa, other parts of the United States, and elsewhere.\n\n===New England and political thought===\n[[Image:Thoreau1967stamp.jpg|thumb|300px|The writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]] influenced thinkers as diverse as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as the modern [[Environmental movement]]]]\n\nDuring the colonial period and the early years of the American republic, New England leaders like [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]], [[John Adams]], and [[Samuel Adams]] joined Patriots in Philadelphia and Virginia to define [[Republicanism in the United States|Republicanism]], and lead the colonies to a war for independence against Great Britain.

New York's leading banker, [[J. P. Morgan]], had grown up in Hartford and had a strong interest in the New England economy. Starting in the 1890s Morgan began financing the major New England railroads, such as the New Haven and the [[Boston and Maine Corporation|Boston and Maine]], dividing territory so they would not compete. In 1903 he brought in [[Charles Sanger Mellen|Charles Mellen]] as president of the New Haven (1903-1913). The goal, richly supported by Morgan's financing, was to purchase and consolidate the main railway lines of New England, merge their operations, lower their costs, electrify the heavily used routes, and modernize the system. With less competition and lower costs, there supposedly would be higher profits. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including streetcars, freight steamers, passenger steamships, and a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over {{convert|2000|mi}} of track, with 120,000 employees, and practically monopolized traffic in a wide swath from Boston to New York City.\n\nMorgan's quest for monopoly angered reformers during the [[Progressive Era]], most notably Boston lawyer [[Louis Brandeis]], who fought the New Haven for years. Mellen's abrasive tactics alienated public opinion, led to high prices for acquisitions and to costly construction. The accident rate rose when efforts were made to save on maintenance costs. Debt soared from $14 million in 1903 to $242 million in 1913. Also in 1913 it was hit by an anti-trust lawsuit by the federal government and was forced to give up its trolley systems.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vincent P. Carosso|title=The Morgans: Private International Bankers, 1854-1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbUtaoTfw28C&pg=PA608|year=1987|publisher=Harvard UP|pages=607\u201310}}</ref>  The advent of automobiles, trucks and buses after 1910 slashed the profits of the New Haven. The line went bankrupt in 1935, was reorganized and reduced in scope, went bankrupt again in 1961, and in 1969 was merged into the Penn Central system, which itself went bankrupt. The remnants of the system are now part of Conrail.<ref>John L. Weller, ''The New Haven Railroad: its rise and fall'' (1969)</ref>\n\nThe automotive revolution came much faster than anyone expected, especially the railroad executives. In 1915 Connecticut had 40,000 automobiles; five years later it had 120,000. There was even faster growth in  trucks from 7,000 to 24,000.<ref>Peter Temin, ed., ''Engines of Enterprise: An Economic History of New England'' (2000) p 185</ref>\n\n===Weather===\nIn the 1930s and 1940s there were winter \"[[outing club]]s\" in a number of areas in New England which held dog sled races, ski jumping, and cross country competitions; [[sulky]] races on cleared streets, and dances.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Gerry |last=Barel |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 2011 |title=Ski Jumping Article Brings Back Memories for a Reader |journal=Vermont's Northland Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=31 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe [[1938 New England hurricane]] hit the region (and Long Island) hard, killing about 700 people.

The factory economy practically disappeared. The [[textile mill]]s one by one went out of business from the 1920s to the 1970s. For example, the Crompton Company, after 178 years in business, went bankrupt in 1984, costing the jobs of 2,450 workers in five states. The major reasons were cheap imports, the strong dollar, declining exports, and a failure to diversify.<ref>Timothy J. Minchin, \"The Crompton Closing: Imports and the Decline of America's Oldest Textile Company, ''Journal of American Studies'' (2013) 47#1 pp 231-260 [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/search?searchType=CITEADVANCE&journals=AMS&volume=47&issue=01&page=231&author=MINCHIN&year=2013 online].</ref>   Shoes followed. What remains is very high technology manufacturing, such as jet engines, nuclear submarines, pharmaceuticals, robotics, scientific instruments, and medical devices.
