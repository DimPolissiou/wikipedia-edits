Starting out in [[English Basketball League]] Division 3 North, the Athletics enjoyed excellent rookie season which saw them lift the Men's National Shield and finish second in the league, but only on countback in games against winners [[Plymouth Raiders|Plymouth Raiders II]]. They also reached the semi-finals of the EBL3 Play-offs.\n\nThe team relocated, from Aston Events Centre to Birmingham Sports Centre in 2006, and, following the dissolution of the [[Birmingham Bullets|Bullets]], the club changed its name to Birmingham Athletics to reflect its status as the only National League team representing the city at the time. They subsequently stated their desire to turn professional by becoming the second EBL team (after [[Coventry Crusaders]]) to apply for membership of the proposed [[British Basketball Association]] (BBA), a league devised to compete with the incumbent [[British Basketball League]] as the premier basketball competition in the country, in its inaugural season in 2007\u201308. However, the BBA never materialized; and this, combined with the BBL and members of the defunct Birmingham Bullets team creating a new Birmingham franchise, the [[Birmingham Panthers]], ultimately prevented Athletics from realizing their professional ambitions.\n\nElite are now primarily a development-focused club; with teams from under 14s to senior, the first team had been based around under-19 players from Elite Academies Basketball League side [[Bournville College]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hoopsfix.com/2017/02/sussex-bears-hold-national-shield-title/|title=Sussex Bears Hold on For National Shield Title|date=20 February 2017}}</ref>.

The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nThe investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nWider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{update-section|date=January 2018}}\nSoon after the incident the Health Protection Agency was stripped of its remit to provide air quality data and it was passed on to the Environment Agency which forms part of the Major Accident Investigation Board.\n\n== Remembrance ==\nAn anniversary service was held in Holy Trinity Church [[Leverstock Green]] on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local hospital would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.stalbans.anglican.org/The-Diocese-and-You/Bishops/Archive/Sermons-and-speeches/Buncefield-Anniversary-Service,-Sunday-10-December-2006 \n |title=Buncefield Anniversary Service, Sunday 10 December 2006 \n |publisher=St Albans Diocese \n |accessdate=20 November 2009 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607064734/http://www.stalbans.anglican.org/The-Diocese-and-You/Bishops/Archive/Sermons-and-speeches/Buncefield-Anniversary-Service%2C-Sunday-10-December-2006 \n |archivedate=7 June 2011 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nTo rebuild the damaged parts of the site, the relevant approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed.

The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being \"filled blind\" with petrol (i.e., being filled without a clear indication of the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nThe investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.<ref name=\"ThisOutdatedArticleNeedsThisReport\"/>\n\nWider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel.

The ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014]]'' was passed on 17 December 2013 with a punishment of [[life in prison]] for \"aggravated homosexuality\".<ref name=\"prison\"/> The law brought [[Uganda]] into international spotlight, and caused international outrage, with many governments refusing to provide aid to Uganda anymore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/will-lgbt-ugandans-ever-be-free-inside-fight-queer-country|title=Will LGBT Ugandans Ever Be Free?

LGBT people continue to face major discrimination in Uganda, actively encouraged by political and religious leaders.

Among the [[Baganda]], Uganda's largest ethnic group, homosexuality was usually treated with indifference. [[Kabaka of Buganda|King]] [[Mwanga II of Buganda]] was famously bisexual, known to have regular sexual relations with women, having had a total of 16 wives, as well as his male subjects. During his reign, he increasingly regarded the Christian missionaries and the European colonial powers, notably the British, as threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref>\n\nMwanga II took a more aggressive approach than other African leaders, choosing to expel all missionaries and insist that Christian and Muslim converts abandon their faith or [[Uganda Martyrs|face death]]. The [[Luganda]] term {{lang|lg|abasiyazi}} refers to homosexuals, though usage nowadays is commonly pejorative. The Baganda were not the only ethnic group known to engage in homosexual acts. Among the [[Lango people]], ''[[mudoko dako]]'' individuals were believed to form a \"[[third gender]]\" alongside male and female. The {{lang|laj|mudoko dako}} were effeminate men, mostly treated by Langi society as women and could marry other men without social sanctions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref> Homosexuality was also acknowledged among the [[Teso people|Teso]], Bahima, [[Bunyoro|Banyoro]], and [[Karamojong people]]s.<ref>[https://www.galck.org/are-you-happy-or-are-you-gay/ Are You Happy Or Are You Gay?]</ref> Societal acceptance disappeared after the arrival of the British and the creation of the [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref name=\"queer2012\">{{Cite web|url=http://queerstoryfiles.blogspot.com/2012/10/gay-in-great-lakes-of-africa.html|title=The Queerstory Files: Gay in the Great Lakes of Africa|first=Tony|last=Scupham-bilton|date=8 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nPresently, there is widespread denial that homosexuality was practised before colonisation. Furthermore, the false belief that homosexuality is \"un-African\" or \"Western\" is quite prevalent in Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nThe term {{lang|sw|kuchu}}, of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, is increasingly used by the Ugandan LGBT community. A documentary film, ''[[Call Me Kuchu]]'' was released in 2012, focusing in part on the 2011 murder of LGBT activist [[David Kato]].\n\n===Statutes===\nLaws prohibiting same-sex sexual acts were first put in place under British colonial rule in the 19th century. Those laws were enshrined in the ''Penal Code Act 1950'' and retained following independence. The following sections of that Act are relevant:\n\n<blockquote>'''Section 145. Unnatural offences.''' Any person who\u2014\n:(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; [or]\n:(b) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or\n:(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\ncommits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.<ref name=\"PCA\">[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ug/ug008en.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, World Intellectual Property Organization]</ref><ref name=\"PCA2\">[http://www.upf.go.ug/download/resources/Penal_Code_Act_1950.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, Uganda Police Force]</ref>\n\n'''Section 146. Attempt to commit unnatural offences.''' Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 145 commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n'''Section 148. Indecent practices.''' Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/></blockquote>\n\nBefore the ''Penal Code Amendment (Gender References) Act 2000'' was enacted, only same-sex acts between men were criminalized. In 2000, that Act was passed and changed references to \"any male\" to \"any person\" so that grossly indecent acts between women were criminalized as well, and are now punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment. The Act also extended this criminalizing such acts to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. This effectively outlawed both [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], regardless of sexual orientation, under the Penal Code.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n====Anti-Homosexuality Act====\n{{Main|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill}}\nOn 13 October 2009, Member of Parliament [[David Bahati]] introduced the ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2009]]'', which would broaden the criminalization of same-sex relationships in [Uganda and introduce the death penalty for serial offenders, HIV-positive people who engage in sexual activity with people of the same sex, and persons who engage in same-sex sexual acts with people under 18 years of age. Individuals or companies that promote LGBT rights would be fined or imprisoned, or both. Persons \"in authority\" would be required to report any offence under the Act within 24 hours or face up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2012, Parliament Speaker [[Rebecca Kadaga]] promised to pass a revised anti-homosexuality law in December 2012. \"Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift.

[[Simon Lokodo]], Minister for Ethics and Integrity, is known by Ugandan LGBT activists as \"the country's main homophobe\", has suggested that rape is more morally acceptable than consensual sex between people of the same sex, has accompanied violent police raids on LGBT events and actively suppresses freedom of speech and of assembly for LGBT people.<ref name=\"mamba\"/>\n\nUganda's main [[LGBT rights]] organization is [[Sexual Minorities Uganda]], founded in 2004 by [[Victor Mukasa]] and has been allowed to conduct its activities without much government interference.

Among the [[Baganda]], Uganda's largest ethnic group, homosexuality was usually treated with indifference. [[Kabaka of Buganda|King]] [[Mwanga II of Buganda]] was famously bisexual, known to have regular sexual relations with women, having had a total of 16 wives, as well as his male subjects. During his reign, he increasingly regarded the Christian missionaries and the European colonial powers, notably the British, as threats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awdflibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/361/13%20Tamale_OutoftheCloset_FemAfrica.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|title=Out of the Closet: Unveiling Sexuality Discourses in Uganda}}</ref>\n\nMwanga II took a more aggressive approach than other African leaders, choosing to expel all missionaries and insist that Christian and Muslim converts abandon their faith or [[Uganda Martyrs|face death]]. The [[Luganda]] term {{lang|lg|abasiyazi}} refers to homosexuals, though usage nowadays is commonly pejorative. The Baganda were not the only ethnic group known to engage in homosexual acts. Among the [[Lango people]], ''[[mudoko dako]]'' individuals were believed to form a \"[[third gender]]\" alongside male and female.

Furthermore, the false belief that homosexuality is \"un-African\" or \"Western\" is quite prevalent in Ugandan society.<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nThe term {{lang|sw|kuchu}}, of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] origin, is increasingly used by the Ugandan LGBT community. A documentary film, ''[[Call Me Kuchu]]'' was released in 2012, focusing in part on the 2011 murder of LGBT activist [[David Kato]].\n\n===Statutes===\nLaws prohibiting same-sex sexual acts were first put in place under British colonial rule in the 19th century. Those laws were enshrined in the ''Penal Code Act 1950'' and retained following independence. The following sections of that Act are relevant:\n\n<blockquote>'''Section 145. Unnatural offences.''' Any person who\u2014\n:(a) has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; [or]\n:(b) has carnal knowledge of an animal; or\n:(c) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,\ncommits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.<ref name=\"PCA\">[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ug/ug008en.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, World Intellectual Property Organization]</ref><ref name=\"PCA2\">[http://www.upf.go.ug/download/resources/Penal_Code_Act_1950.pdf Penal Code Act 1950, Uganda Police Force]</ref>\n\n'''Section 146. Attempt to commit unnatural offences.''' Any person who attempts to commit any of the offences specified in section 145 commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n'''Section 148. Indecent practices.''' Any person who, whether in public or in private, commits any act of gross indecency with another person or procures another person to commit any act of gross indecency with him or her or attempts to procure the commission of any such act by any person with himself or herself or with another person, whether in public or in private, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for seven years.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/></blockquote>\n\nBefore the ''Penal Code Amendment (Gender References) Act 2000'' was enacted, only same-sex acts between men were criminalized. In 2000, that Act was passed and changed references to \"any male\" to \"any person\" so that grossly indecent acts between women were criminalized as well, and are now punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment. The Act also extended this criminalizing such acts to both homosexuals and heterosexuals. This effectively outlawed both [[oral sex]] and [[anal sex]], regardless of sexual orientation, under the Penal Code.<ref name=\"PCA\"/><ref name=\"PCA2\"/>\n\n====Anti-Homosexuality Act====\n{{Main|Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill}}\nOn 13 October 2009, Member of Parliament [[David Bahati]] introduced the ''[[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2009]]'', which would broaden the criminalization of same-sex relationships in [Uganda and introduce the death penalty for serial offenders, HIV-positive people who engage in sexual activity with people of the same sex, and persons who engage in same-sex sexual acts with people under 18 years of age. Individuals or companies that promote LGBT rights would be fined or imprisoned, or both. Persons \"in authority\" would be required to report any offence under the Act within 24 hours or face up to three years' imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2012, Parliament Speaker [[Rebecca Kadaga]] promised to pass a revised anti-homosexuality law in December 2012. \"Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift.

Manufactured by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now [[Boeing]]) and [[British Aerospace]] (now [[BAE Systems]]), the T-45 is used by the [[United States Navy]] as an [[aircraft carrier]]-capable trainer.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe T-45 Goshawk has its origins within the mid-1970s, during which time the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] formally commenced its search for a new jet trainer aircraft to serve as a single replacement for both its [[T-2 Buckeye]] and [[A-4 Skyhawk]] trainers.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> During 1978, the VTXTS advanced trainer program to meet this need was formally launched by the U.S. Navy. An [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[United States|American]] team, comprising British aviation manufacturer [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) and American aircraft company [[McDonnell Douglas]] (MDC), decided to submit their proposal for a navalised version of the land-based [[BAE Systems Hawk]] trainer. Other manufacturers also submitted bids, such as a rival team of French aircraft company [[Dassault Aviation]], German manufacturer [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] and American aerospace company [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], who offered their [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]] to fulfil the requirement.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/>\n\nThe VTX-TS competition was not simply for the procurement of an aircraft in isolation; it comprised five core areas: the aircraft itself, capable flight simulators, matured academic training aids, integrated [[logistics|logistic]] support, and program management.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> For their proposal, MDC was the prime contractor and systems integrator, BAe functioned as the principal subcontractor and partner for the aircraft element, [[Rolls-Royce Plc|Rolls-Royce]] provided the Adour engine to power the aircraft, and [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] is the principal subcontractor for the simulator system.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> During November 1981, the U.S. Navy announced that it had selected the Hawk as the winner of the VTX-TS competition.<ref name= \"gaines 21\">Gaines 1988, p. 21.</ref> Reportedly, approximately 60 per cent of the work on the T-45 program was undertaken overseas in Britain. During September 1982, a Full Scale Engineering Development contract was awarded to the MDC team to fully develop and produce the proposed aircraft, which had been designated ''T-45 Goshawk''.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> On 16 April 1988, the first T-45A Goshawk conducted its [[maiden flight]].<ref name= \"mil dir 98\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:T-45A Goshawk 04.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of T-45A Goshawks during a training flight over Texas]]\n\nWork on the production of the Goshawk was divided between the two primary partner companies. [[BAE Systems]] (BAe's successor following its merger with [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] during 1999) was responsible for manufacturing the fuselage aft of the cockpit, along with the [[Intake#Aircraft_intakes|air inlet]]s, and the [[vertical direction|vertical]] stabilizer of the T-45 at their [[Samlesbury Aerodrome|Samlesbury]] facility, while the wings were produced at the company's plant at [[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]], England. [[Boeing]] (which had merged with McDonnell Douglas during 1997) performed the manufacture of the remaining elements of the Goshawk, as well as conducting assembly of the type at a production line at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], after having transferred work on the program from the company's facility in [[Long Beach, California]].\n\nThe Goshawk retained the typical powerplant used by the Hawk, the [[Rolls-Royce Adour]] [[turbofan]] jet engine.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/adour-variant-developed-for-bae-hawk-4886/ \"Adour variant developed for BAe Hawk.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916182835/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/adour-variant-developed-for-bae-hawk-4886/ |date=16 September 2017 }} ''Flight International'', 19 June 1997.</ref> During the mid-1990s, [[Rolls-Royce Plc|Rolls-Royce]] worked on establishing a US-based production line for the Adour engine, which was to be operated by the former [[Allison Engine Company]] (which had been recently acquired by Rolls-Royce in 1995); however, during September 1997, the U.S. Navy chose to terminate the partially-finished engine effort.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usnavy-sinks-adour-plan-18848/ \"USNavy sinks Adour plan.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916225059/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usnavy-sinks-adour-plan-18848/ |date=16 September 2017 }} ''Flight International'', 3 September 1998.</ref> Around this time, the U.S. Navy was greatly interested in potentially adopting another powerplant, the [[International Turbine Engine Company]]'s [[Honeywell/ITEC F124|F124]] turbofan engine, for the Goshawk.

Manufactured by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (now [[Boeing]]) and [[British Aerospace]] (now [[BAE Systems]]), the T-45 is used by the [[United States Navy]] as an [[aircraft carrier]]-capable trainer.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nThe T-45 Goshawk has its origins within the mid-1970s, during which time the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] formally commenced its search for a new jet trainer aircraft to serve as a single replacement for both its [[T-2 Buckeye]] and [[A-4 Skyhawk]] trainers.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> During 1978, the VTXTS advanced trainer program to meet this need was formally launched by the U.S. Navy. An [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[United States|American]] team, comprising British aviation manufacturer [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) and American aircraft company [[McDonnell Douglas]] (MDC), decided to submit their proposal for a navalised version of the land-based [[BAE Systems Hawk]] trainer. Other manufacturers also submitted bids, such as a rival team of French aircraft company [[Dassault Aviation]], German manufacturer [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] and American aerospace company [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], who offered their [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha Jet]] to fulfil the requirement.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/>\n\nThe VTX-TS competition was not simply for the procurement of an aircraft in isolation; it comprised five core areas: the aircraft itself, capable flight simulators, matured academic training aids, integrated [[logistics|logistic]] support, and program management.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> For their proposal, MDC was the prime contractor and systems integrator, BAe functioned as the principal subcontractor and partner for the aircraft element, [[Rolls-Royce Plc|Rolls-Royce]] provided the Adour engine to power the aircraft, and [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] is the principal subcontractor for the simulator system.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> During November 1981, the U.S. Navy announced that it had selected the Hawk as the winner of the VTX-TS competition.<ref name= \"gaines 21\">Gaines 1988, p. 21.</ref> Reportedly, approximately 60 per cent of the work on the T-45 program was undertaken overseas in Britain. During September 1982, a Full Scale Engineering Development contract was awarded to the MDC team to fully develop and produce the proposed aircraft, which had been designated ''T-45 Goshawk''.<ref name= \"gaines 21\"/> On 16 April 1988, the first T-45A Goshawk conducted its [[maiden flight]].<ref name= \"mil dir 98\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:T-45A Goshawk 04.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of T-45A Goshawks during a training flight over Texas]]\n\nWork on the production of the Goshawk was divided between the two primary partner companies. [[BAE Systems]] (BAe's successor following its merger with [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] during 1999) was responsible for manufacturing the fuselage aft of the cockpit, along with the [[Intake#Aircraft_intakes|air inlet]]s, and the [[vertical direction|vertical]] stabilizer of the T-45 at their [[Samlesbury Aerodrome|Samlesbury]] facility, while the wings were produced at the company's plant at [[Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire|Brough]], England. [[Boeing]] (which had merged with McDonnell Douglas during 1997) performed the manufacture of the remaining elements of the Goshawk, as well as conducting assembly of the type at a production line at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], after having transferred work on the program from the company's facility in [[Long Beach, California]].\n\nThe Goshawk retained the typical powerplant used by the Hawk, the [[Rolls-Royce Adour]] [[turbofan]] jet engine.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/adour-variant-developed-for-bae-hawk-4886/ \"Adour variant developed for BAe Hawk.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916182835/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/adour-variant-developed-for-bae-hawk-4886/ |date=16 September 2017 }} ''Flight International'', 19 June 1997.</ref> During the mid-1990s, [[Rolls-Royce Plc|Rolls-Royce]] worked on establishing a US-based production line for the Adour engine, which was to be operated by the former [[Allison Engine Company]] (which had been recently acquired by Rolls-Royce in 1995); however, during September 1997, the U.S. Navy chose to terminate the partially-finished engine effort.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usnavy-sinks-adour-plan-18848/ \"USNavy sinks Adour plan.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916225059/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usnavy-sinks-adour-plan-18848/ |date=16 September 2017 }} ''Flight International'', 3 September 1998.</ref> Around this time, the U.S. Navy was greatly interested in potentially adopting another powerplant, the [[International Turbine Engine Company]]'s [[Honeywell/ITEC F124|F124]] turbofan engine, for the Goshawk.
