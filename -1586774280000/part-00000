Wilder had personally ensured that his \"[[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" of [[mounted infantry]] was equipped with the new [[Spencer repeating rifle]], though he initially had to appeal to his men to pay for these weapons themselves, before the government agreed to carry the cost. The victory at Hoover's Gap was attributed largely to Wilder's persistence in procuring the new rifles, which totally disoriented the enemy.\n\n==Early life and career==\nWilder was born in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in [[Hunter, New York|Hunter]], [[Greene County, New York]], the son of Reuben and Mary (Merritt) Wilder. He was a descendant of a long line of soldiers. His grandfather and great-grandfather, both named Seth Wilder, fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. After the great-grandfather lost a leg in the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], Seth, Jr. took his place. Wilder's father Reuben fought in the [[War of 1812]].\n\nWilder spent his younger years in Hunter, where he attended school. When he turned nineteen, his school days over, he decided to head west to make it on his own. Wilder soon arrived in [[Columbus, Ohio]], nearly penniless, and found employment as [[Drafter|draftsman]] and then as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] [[millwright]] at a local [[foundry]]. This training would lay the groundwork for his career.\n\nIn 1857, eight years after he arrived in Columbus, Wilder moved to [[Indiana]], first to [[Lawrenceburg, Indiana|Lawrenceburg]] and then to [[Greensburg, Indiana|Greensburg]], where he married Martha Jane Stewart and raised a large family. He established a small foundry of his own, which rapidly became a success. Wilder invented many [[hydraulic]] machines that he patented, and he sold equipment, as well as building mills and hydraulic works in many of the surrounding states. He also became nationally renowned as an expert in the field of hydraulics, patenting a unique [[water wheel]] in 1859.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Richard A.|title=Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga|date=2007|publisher=Blue Acorn Press|location=Huntington WV|isbn=978-1-885033-35-2|page=20}}</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Wilder organized a light [[artillery]] [[Company (military unit)|company]] in the Greensburg area, even going so far as to cast two [[M1841 6-pounder field gun|six-pounder cannons]] at his foundry. Wilder's company was mustered into state service but the Federal government declined to accept it, as Indiana had already met its quota of artillery units.  Instead, Wilder was commissioned as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]], and his men were organized as Company A, [[17th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] at [[Indianapolis]]. When the 17th Indiana left for western [[Virginia]] in July 1861, Company A took along the two cannons. Once in Virginia, the old Company A was permanently detached and eventually reorganized as the [[26th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]] but was commonly known as the \"Wilder Battery\" in recognition of its first commander.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Terrell|first1=W.H.H.|title=Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana|date=1866|publisher=Samuel M. Douglass|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|page=448|edition=Volume III}}</ref> Meanwhile, Captain Wilder was quickly promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the 17th Indiana on 4 June 1861, serving where he remained during the early campaigns in Virginia and garrison duty in [[Kentucky]]. In March 1862 Wilder was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], becoming the commander of the 17th Indiana. During the campaign to take [[Siege of Corinth|Corinth, Mississippi]], Wilder quickly earned a reputation as a competent, and even gifted, regimental commander.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Richard A.|title=Blue Lightning|date=2007|publisher=Blue Acorn Press|location=Huntington WV|isbn=978-1-885033-35-2|page=20}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1862 [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] offensive into [[Kentucky]], Gen. [[Braxton Bragg]]'s army left [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], in late August. Bragg approached [[Battle of Munfordville|Munfordville]], a station on the [[Louisville & Nashville Railroad]] where Wilder commanded the Union garrison, which consisted of three regiments with extensive fortifications. Wilder refused [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James R. Chalmers]]'s demand to surrender on September 14, telling him, \"I think we'll fight for a while\", and his men repulsed Chalmers's attacks that day, inflicting 283 casualties with a loss of only 37.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref>  This forced the Confederates to conduct [[siege]] operations September 15\u201316. By this time, Wilder's 4,000 men were almost completely surrounded by 22,000 Confederates with 100 artillery pieces. Realizing that Union reinforcements were nearby and not wanting to kill or injure innocent civilians, the Confederates communicated still another demand for surrender. Wilder personally entered enemy lines blindfolded under a flag of truce, and Maj. Gen. [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]] escorted him to view all the Confederate troops and to convince him of the futility of resisting. Impressed, Wilder surrendered his garrison. The formal ceremony occurred on September 17. Wilder spent two months as a [[prisoner of war]] before being exchanged.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 14-15.</ref>\n\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\nWilder received wide attention for his performance in the [[Tullahoma Campaign]]. He mounted his brigade on horses and mules that his men appropriated from the local area and moved into the battle with such rapidity that his men soon became known as the \"[[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\", comprising the 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment, the [[72nd Indiana Infantry Regiment]], the [[98th Illinois Infantry Regiment]], the [[123rd Illinois Infantry Regiment]], and the [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A.

(They were also known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because Wilder issued them long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.) His men also carried [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, which were capable of a rate of fire far greater than their Confederate adversaries. Bypassing Army red tape, Wilder had asked his men to vote on purchasing the rifles and they agreed unanimously. He obtained a loan from his hometown bank and each man of the brigade co-signed a personal loan of $35 ([[USD|$]]713 in 2019) for his rifle. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>  On June 24, the Lightning Brigade seized and held [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]].  Despite orders from general [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to hold the position, defeating repeated attempts to dislodge his force until the infantry arrived and winning the most significant battle in the Tullahoma Campaign.  The Army of the Cumberland's commanding officer, [[William Rosecrans]] soon arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> Wilder was the principal commander of a diversion launched against Chattanooga - artillery bombardments known as the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga]] - deceiving the Confederates into thinking the Union army would approach Chattanooga from the north in conjunction with Union forces at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]].<ref>Woodworth, p. 54.</ref>\n\nJust before the start of the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], Wilder's brigade played a crucial role at Alexander's Bridge on September 18, 1863, defending the crossing of West [[Chickamauga Creek]] and helping to prevent the Confederates from flanking the Union army.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 83-84.</ref> On the second day at Chickamauga, September 20, Wilder's brigade with its superior firepower was one of the few units that was not immediately routed by the Confederate onslaught against the Union right flank. Advancing from its reserve position, the brigade launched a strong counterattack, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Wilder decided to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of the main Confederate column. However, just then Assistant [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nMaj. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]] formally commended Colonel Wilder for his performance at Chickamauga. Wilder did not directly participate in the main [[Chattanooga Campaign|Battles for Chattanooga]] in November, but he led the brigade during much of the [[Atlanta Campaign]] in the spring and summer of 1864. He was promoted to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers on August 7, 1864. Throughout much of 1863 and 1864, Wilder suffered from bouts of [[dysentery]] <ref>{{cite book|title=John T.

For health reasons, he resigned from the Army in October 1864 and returned home.<ref>Eicher, p. 569; Cox, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Postbellum career==\nAfter the war, Wilder settled in [[Rockwood, Tennessee]], and later in Chattanooga. In 1867, he founded an [[ironworks]] in the Chattanooga region, then built and operated the first two [[blast furnace]]s in the [[Southern United States|South]] at Rockwood, Tennessee. In 1870, he established a company in Chattanooga to manufacture rails for the railroads. From 1884 to 1892, he helped promote and construct the [[Charleston, Cincinnati & Chicago Railroad]] while living in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]. While in Johnson City, he developed the booming industrial suburb of Carnegie, named in honor of fellow industrialist, [[Andrew Carnegie]], and a host of iron making and railroad-related manufacturing facilities. Iron ore was brought to Johnson City via the [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad]], and Wilder constructed a popular 166-room hotel near Johnson City named the Cloudland Hotel near the summit of [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]] to serve tourists via this scenic [[narrow gauge railway]] line.\n\nWilder entered politics and was elected [[mayor]] of Chattanooga in 1871. He resigned a year later to pursue his business interests. He unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States Congress]] in 1876. In 1877, he accepted the position of city postmaster, serving until 1882.\n\nHe moved to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], in 1897 after receiving an appointment from President [[William McKinley]] as a Federal pension agent, then was commissioner of the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]].\n\nHe died in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], aged 87, while on his annual winter vacation with his second wife, Dora Lee, and was returned for burial in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga with his first wife, Martha Jane Stewart.\n\nTwo of Wilder's homes in Tennessee, the [[General John T. Wilder House]] in Knoxville and the [[John T. Wilder House]] in [[Roan Mountain, Tennessee|Roan Mountain]], are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Another that he built in Greensburg, Indiana is commemorated by a historic marker.\n\n==Notes==\n{{portal|American Civil War|Biography}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

For health reasons, he resigned from the Army in October 1864 and returned home.<ref>Eicher, p. 569; Cox, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Postbellum career==\nAfter the war, Wilder settled in [[Rockwood, Tennessee]], and later in Chattanooga. In 1867, he founded an [[ironworks]] in the Chattanooga region, then built and operated the first two [[blast furnace]]s in the [[Southern United States|South]] at Rockwood, Tennessee. In 1870, he established a company in Chattanooga to manufacture rails for the railroads. From 1884 to 1892, he helped promote and construct the [[Charleston, Cincinnati & Chicago Railroad]] while living in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]. While in Johnson City, he developed the booming industrial suburb of Carnegie, named in honor of fellow industrialist, [[Andrew Carnegie]], and a host of iron making and railroad-related manufacturing facilities. Iron ore was brought to Johnson City via the [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad]], and Wilder constructed a popular 166-room hotel near Johnson City named the Cloudland Hotel near the summit of [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]] to serve tourists via this scenic [[narrow gauge railway]] line.\n\nWilder entered politics and was elected [[mayor]] of Chattanooga in 1871. He resigned a year later to pursue his business interests. He unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States Congress]] in 1876. In 1877, he accepted the position of city postmaster, serving until 1882.\n\nHe moved to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], in 1897 after receiving an appointment from President [[William McKinley]] as a Federal pension agent, then was commissioner of the [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]].\n\nHe died in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], aged 87, while on his annual winter vacation with his second wife, Dora Lee, and was returned for burial in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga with his first wife, Martha Jane Stewart.\n\nTwo of Wilder's homes in Tennessee, the [[General John T. Wilder House]] in Knoxville and the [[John T. Wilder House]] in [[Roan Mountain, Tennessee|Roan Mountain]], are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Another that he built in Greensburg, Indiana is commemorated by a historic marker.\n\n==Notes==\n{{portal|American Civil War|Biography}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

[[Incidental music]] for the original production was written by [[Darius Milhaud]] and for the play's first Paris revivals by [[Francis Poulenc]].<ref>Jean Anouilh, ''Le Voyageur sans bagage'': Edition de Bernard Beugnot, Gallimard, Paris 2007</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGaston, a veteran of [[World War I]], suffers from [[amnesia]] and has spent the last 18 years in a hospital trying to regain his memories. Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was first presented on 16 February 1937 and was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.

Notley came to prominence as a member of the second generation of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of poetry--although she has always denied being involved with the New School movement, or any specific movement in general--having been a workshop leader and frequent attendee and reader at the school's hub, the St. Mark's [[Poetry Project]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}  Notley's early work laid both formal and theoretical groundwork for several generations of poets; she is considered a pioneering voice on topics like motherhood and domestic life.  \n\nNotley's experimentation with poetic form, seen in her books ''165 Meeting House Lane'', ''When I Was Alive'', ''The Descent of Alette'', and ''Culture of One'', ranges from a blurred line between genres, to a quotation-mark driven interpretation of the variable foot, to a full reinvention of the purpose and potential of strict rhythm and meter.  She also experimented with channeling spirits of deceased loved ones, primarily men gone from her life like her father and her husband, poet Ted Berrigan, and used these conversations as topics and form on her poetry. Her poems have also been compared to Gertrude Stein, as well as her contemporary Bernadette Mayer. Mayer and Notley both used their experience as mothers and wives in their work.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn addition to poetry, Notley has written a book of criticism (''Coming After'', University of Michigan, 2005), a play (\"Anne's White Glove\"\u2014performed at the Eye & Ear Theater in 1985), a biography (''Tell Me Again'', Am Here, 1982), and she has edited three publications, Chicago, Gare du Nord, and Scarlet.  Notley's collage art appeared in [[Rudy Burckhardt]]'s film \"Wayward Glimpses\" and her illustrations have appeared on the cover of numerous books, including a few of her own. As is often written in her biographical notes, \"she has never tried to be anything other than a poet,\" and with over forty books and chapbooks and several major awards, she is one of the most prolific and lauded American poets today. She is a recipient of the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]].\n\n==Early life==\nNotley was born on November 8, 1945 in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] and grew up in [[Needles, California]].  Notley wrote extensively of her childhood and early life in her book ''Tell Me Again'' (Am here, 1982).\n\nNotley left Needles for New York City to attend [[Barnard College]] in 1963, desiring an escape from the isolation of her hometown.<ref>Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets</ref>  She received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from Barnard College in spring 1967 and left New York City that fall for the fiction program at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. She was the only woman in her genre and one of two in the entire graduate writing department.  Notley cites\u2014in part\u2014a reading by [[Robert Creeley]] as early inspiration for her writing more poetry.  A close relationship with the poet [[Anselm Hollo]], who was teaching at the program at that time, led to Notley leaving Iowa City for Morocco in 1968.  Notley claims it was boring and returned to Iowa City where she met the poet [[Ted Berrigan]] who began as an instructor at the school that fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/conversation-alice-notley-poets-novel|title=A conversation with Alice Notley on the poet's novel - Jacket2|website=Jacket2.org|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter Notley's graduation, she and Berrigan spent periods of time in New York City and Buffalo.  During the winter of 1970\u201371, Notley and Berrigan lived on Long Island, where Notley wrote her first book, ''165 Meeting House Lane'' (Twenty-Four Sonnets).  The book took its title from the address of their home on Long Island and was published by Berrigan's C Press.  It bears a dedication to [[James Schuyler]] and Anne and [[Fairfield Porter]], who were also residing together on Long Island at the time.  Notley also thanks [[Tom Clark (poet)|Tom Clark]] who would go on to re-publish the sonnet cycle in his anthology ''All Stars.''<ref>Notley, Alice. ''165 Meeting House Lane.'' New York: C Press, 1971.</ref>  Notley and Berrigan spent the several months between Long Island and Chicago in [[Bolinas, California]], which is where Berrigan officially printed ''165 Meeting House Lane''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue3/renhist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118060058/http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue3/renhist.html |archivedate=January 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Notley's second book, Phoebe Light, was published in 1973 by [[Bill Berkson]]'s Bolinas-based press Big Sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbridge.org/bol-11.htm|title=Dreaming As One, by Kevin Opstedal - Chapter 11|website=Bigbridge.org|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==1972-75: Chicago & Essex==\nIn 1972, Notley married Berrigan and the two moved to Chicago where Berrigan had been given [[Ed Dorn]]'s newly vacated teaching position at [[Northeastern Illinois University]].  Notley and Berrigan joined an already active community of Chicago poets, including [[Paul Carroll (poet)|Paul Carroll]], [[Paul Hoover]], and [[Maxine Chernoff]]. Notley gave birth to their first son, [[Anselm Berrigan]], named after Anselm Hollo, in 1972, as well.\n\nAt Berrigan's behest, his students at Northeastern became very active members of the local poetry scene, starting magazines and reading series.  One group of students\u2014Darlene Pearlstein, Peter Kostakis, and Richard Friedman\u2014started a small poetry press, The Yellow Press, which would go on to publish two books by Notley, one book by Berrigan, and give out a yearly Ted Berrigan Prize\u2014overseen in part by Notley\u2014for a first book (though the press would cease publishing two years in).  Young poets on the Chicago scene regularly hung out with Notley and Berrigan at their home and many followed the couple back to New York City in the late 70s.  The circle of younger poets who spent time with Notley and Berrigan included the aforementioned members of the Yellow Press team, Barbara Barg, Rochelle Kraut, Rose Lesniak, Bob Rosenthal, Steve Levine, Simon Schuchat, Tim Milk, and several others.<ref>Interview with Barbara Barg, Rose Lesniak, and Tim Milk.  November 2014.</ref>\n\nWhile in Chicago, Notley started publishing her magazine ''Chicago'', a legal-sized mimeograph publication which would continue through both her pregnancies and even her relocation to England.  Notley began the magazine to connect with preexisting poet friends and meet new writers on both coasts while living in the midwest.  The magazine ran for eight issues, three of which were published while Notley and Berrigan lived in England.  Notley edited seven of the issues with Berrigan taking over one while Notley was pregnant with their first son.  The artist [[George Schneeman]], perhaps most famous for his artworks that appeared on the covers of dozens of books of poetry, did all of the covers for the magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theconversant.org/?p=5891 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903175752/http://theconversant.org/?p=5891 |archive-date=September 3, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Berrigan got a job as a visiting poet at [[University of Essex]], so Notley and Berrigan, with their son Anselm, relocated first to [[London]], then to [[Brightlingsea]] in [[Essex]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://barzakh.net/site/issue-01/286 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908091945/http://barzakh.net/site/issue-01/286 |archivedate=September 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  While in England, Notley would write her second sonnet cycle ''Great Interiors, Wines and Spirits of the World,'' which was originally published in a Notley-themed issue of the Chicago magazine Out There.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onedit.net/issue5/alicen/24.html|title=onedit 5 - Alice Notley : GREAT INTERIORS, WINES AND SPIRITS OF THE WORLD|website=Onedit.net|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom February through June 1974 in [[Wivenhoe]], Essex, Notley wrote her book ''Songs for the Unborn Second Baby'' (United Artists, 1979). While Notley had written on motherhood prior to ''Songs'', this book was her first to focus fully on the matter and is the first full-length book of a [[New York School (art)|New York School]]-affiliated poet to take on the task of addressing poetry's sexism and the pressures and setbacks of motherhood in both personal and creative life. ''Songs for the Unborn Second Baby'' is currently not fully in print. There are seven pages in Notley's book ''Grave of Light: New and Selected Poems''. Notley gave birth to her and Berrigan's second child, [[Edmund Berrigan]], at Colchester Hospital in 1974.\n\nThe couple returned to Chicago for a brief period of time after their year in England before moving to New York City in 1976.\n\n==1976-92: New York City==\n1976 saw Notley and Berrigan moving their family permanently to New York City's [[Lower East Side]], where they'd live together until Berrigan's death in 1983.  Their apartment at 101 St. Mark's Place again became a hub for both young writers and Berrigan and Notley's contemporaries.  Notley remained fairly prolific during this era, writing and publishing several full-length collections.  Perpetually strapped for cash, the two took on whatever small jobs they could to support the family.  Notley and Berrigan were frequent instructors at [[Naropa University]]'s summer writing program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naropa?sort=titleSorter|title=Naropa Poetics Audio Archives : Free Audio : Free Download, Borrow and Streaming : Internet Archive|website=Archive.org|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>  Some of Notley's most famous engagements with the poetry community while in NYC were her workshops at the [[Poetry Project]] at St. Mark's Church, which were attended by dozens of young poets including [[Bob Holman]], [[Patricia Spears Jones]], [[Steve Carey]], and Susie Timmons. [[Eileen Myles]] wrote of her experience in Notley's workshops in her books ''Chelsea Girls'' (Black Sparrow Press, 2004; Ecco, 2015) and ''Inferno'' (O/R Books, 2010). Of her 1983 workshop, Notley wrote:\n\n{{Quote|text=I expect my workshop will be similar to past Alice Notley workshops: same old format, assignments, xeroxes, forms, occasions, geometries, kinds of poems, speculations on and practice of the lofty and the silly.  I assume I've learned a little more since the last time I taught, and that I've a little more to learn in the teaching.  If not, boo hoo.  Other possible issues: goofy works, \"description,\" dreams (the new gen), school of Susie Timmons, rejuvenation of the \"found work,\" the \"line,\" how to be like Elinor [Nauen] and Maggie [Dubris], how to cultivate inventiveness, strategies for dry spell, dictionaries, diaries, little plays, calligrams, tiles, left-hand margins, how to get great theories and general self-improvement.}}<ref>[http://cassandragillig.tumblr.com/post/105654929667/1983]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Notley led a workshop where participants were required to write an entire book during the course of their meetings.  After the workshop ended, Notley teamed up with students to print copies of their works on the mimeograph machine in the St. Mark's basement.  The books were published under the imprint Unimproved Editions and Notley made cover art for the majority of the titles.<ref>Reading in Buffalo, New York, April 10, 1987</ref>  Her own book, entitled ''Parts of a Wedding,'' was published first in a small edition by Unimproved Editions then later as a section of the O Books anthology ''O One.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obookspoetry.org/o-onean-anthology/|title=O Books Poetry is under construction|publisher=|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBerrigan's death in 1983 struck the poetry community exceptionally hard and over the next decade, Notley would suffer the loss of many others who were close to her.  Notley's 1985 play \"Anne's White Glove,\" a commission by [[Ada Katz]]'s [[Eye and Ear Theater]] navigated the pain of Berrigan's death, and her collections ''Margaret & Dusty'' (Coffee House, 1985), ''Parts of a Wedding'' (Unimproved Editions, 1986), and ''At Night the States'' (The Yellow Press, 1987) contain material written during a period of mourning.  Notley's elegiac work during this era, including her poems \"Beginning With a Stain\" and \"At Night the States,\" is some of her most widely celebrated.\n\n==1992-present: Paris==\n\nIn 1992, Notley moved to [[Paris]] with her second husband, the British poet and novelist [[Douglas Oliver]] (1937\u20132000), whom she met while living in England in 1974.  The two worked on two magazines together, Gare du Nord and Scarlet, and self-published a compendium of their own books, ''The Scarlet Cabinet,'' which contained Notley's ''Descent of Alette.'' ''Descent'' would grow to be Notley's most widely read and taught collection after its reprinting by Penguin in 1996. Notley has remained in Paris but makes several trips to the United States each year to give readings and teach small workshops. Some have linked Notley's geographical move to Paris\u2014since it followed a period of intensely personal writing\u2014as also marking a creative distance between herself and her poems, though her books ''Mysteries of Small Houses'' (Penguin, 1998) and ''Culture of One'' (Penguin, 2011) engage very much with personal matter.\n\nIn 1999, Notley was both a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a winner of the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] for Poetry. In spring 2001, she received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the [[Poetry Society of America]]'s [[Shelley Memorial Award]]. This period also marked an increase in scholarly interest in Notley's work.\n\nNotley has stayed very involved in the preservation of both Berrigan and Oliver's works, having edited and written introductions for a number of their books and she continues to be a prolific and powerful force in contemporary poetry, winning the Leonore Marshall Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2015/05/alice-notley-awarded-2015-ruth-lilly-poetry-prize|title=Alice Notley Awarded 2015 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize by Harriet Staff|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date=April 21, 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref> Several poems from her 2007 collection ''In the Pines'' were set to music by the Canadian [[indie pop]] band [[AroarA]] for their [[2014 Polaris Music Prize]]-nominated 2013 EP ''In the Pines''<ref>[http://music.cbc.ca/#/artists/AroarA AroarA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=March 1, 2016 }} at [[CBC Music]].</ref> and in Fall 2014, a conference celebrating Notley's work was held at the Bay Area Public School in Oakland, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/08/bay-area-public-school-announces-three-day-symposium-on-alice-notley|title=Bay Area Public School Announces Three-Day Symposium on Alice Notley by Harriet Staff|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date=April 21, 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref> Over two nights, November 14 and 15, 2016, Notley read ''The Descent of Alette'' in its entirety at [[The Lab (organization)|The Lab]] in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelab.org/projects/2016/10/20/alice-notley-the-descent-of-alette|title=Alice Notley: The Descent of Alette|website=The Lab|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break}}\n;1970s\n* ''Poems & stories (thesis, unpublished)'' (University of Iowa, 1970)\n* ''165 Meeting House Lane'' (C Press, 1971)\n* ''Phoebe Light'' (Big Sky, 1973)\n* ''Incidentals in the Day World'' (Angel Hair, 1973)\n* ''For Frank O'Hara's Birthday'' (Reality Street, 1976)\n* ''Alice Ordered to Be Made'' (The Yellow Press, 1976)\n* ''A Diamond Necklace'' (Frontward Books, 1977)\n* ''Songs for the Unborn Second Baby'' (United Artists, 1979)\n{{col-break}}\n;1980s\n* ''Dr. Williams' Heiresses'' (Tuumba, 1980)\n* ''When I Was Alive'' (Vehicle Editions, 1980)\n* ''How Spring Comes'' (Toothpaste Press, 1980)\n* ''Waltzing Matilda'' (Kulchur Press, 1981;

Notley came to prominence as a member of the second generation of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of poetry--although she has always denied being involved with the New School movement, or any specific movement in general--having been a workshop leader and frequent attendee and reader at the school's hub, the St. Mark's [[Poetry Project]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}  Notley's early work laid both formal and theoretical groundwork for several generations of poets; she is considered a pioneering voice on topics like motherhood and domestic life.  \n\nNotley's experimentation with poetic form, seen in her books ''165 Meeting House Lane'', ''When I Was Alive'', ''The Descent of Alette'', and ''Culture of One'', ranges from a blurred line between genres, to a quotation-mark driven interpretation of the variable foot, to a full reinvention of the purpose and potential of strict rhythm and meter.  She also experimented with channeling spirits of deceased loved ones, primarily men gone from her life like her father and her husband, poet Ted Berrigan, and used these conversations as topics and form on her poetry. Her poems have also been compared to Gertrude Stein, as well as her contemporary Bernadette Mayer. Mayer and Notley both used their experience as mothers and wives in their work.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn addition to poetry, Notley has written a book of criticism (''Coming After'', University of Michigan, 2005), a play (\"Anne's White Glove\"\u2014performed at the Eye & Ear Theater in 1985), a biography (''Tell Me Again'', Am Here, 1982), and she has edited three publications, Chicago, Gare du Nord, and Scarlet.  Notley's collage art appeared in [[Rudy Burckhardt]]'s film \"Wayward Glimpses\" and her illustrations have appeared on the cover of numerous books, including a few of her own. As is often written in her biographical notes, \"she has never tried to be anything other than a poet,\" and with over forty books and chapbooks and several major awards, she is one of the most prolific and lauded American poets today. She is a recipient of the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]].\n\n==Early life==\nNotley was born on November 8, 1945 in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] and grew up in [[Needles, California]].  Notley wrote extensively of her childhood and early life in her book ''Tell Me Again'' (Am here, 1982).\n\nNotley left Needles for New York City to attend [[Barnard College]] in 1963, desiring an escape from the isolation of her hometown.<ref>Encyclopedia of the New York School Poets</ref>  She received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from Barnard College in spring 1967 and left New York City that fall for the fiction program at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]. She was the only woman in her genre and one of two in the entire graduate writing department.  Notley cites\u2014in part\u2014a reading by [[Robert Creeley]] as early inspiration for her writing more poetry.  A close relationship with the poet [[Anselm Hollo]], who was teaching at the program at that time, led to Notley leaving Iowa City for Morocco in 1968.  Notley claims it was boring and returned to Iowa City where she met the poet [[Ted Berrigan]] who began as an instructor at the school that fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jacket2.org/commentary/conversation-alice-notley-poets-novel|title=A conversation with Alice Notley on the poet's novel - Jacket2|website=Jacket2.org|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter Notley's graduation, she and Berrigan spent periods of time in New York City and Buffalo.  During the winter of 1970\u201371, Notley and Berrigan lived on Long Island, where Notley wrote her first book, ''165 Meeting House Lane'' (Twenty-Four Sonnets).  The book took its title from the address of their home on Long Island and was published by Berrigan's C Press.  It bears a dedication to [[James Schuyler]] and Anne and [[Fairfield Porter]], who were also residing together on Long Island at the time.  Notley also thanks [[Tom Clark (poet)|Tom Clark]] who would go on to re-publish the sonnet cycle in his anthology ''All Stars.''<ref>Notley, Alice. ''165 Meeting House Lane.'' New York: C Press, 1971.</ref>  Notley and Berrigan spent the several months between Long Island and Chicago in [[Bolinas, California]], which is where Berrigan officially printed ''165 Meeting House Lane''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue3/renhist.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118060058/http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue3/renhist.html |archivedate=January 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Notley's second book, Phoebe Light, was published in 1973 by [[Bill Berkson]]'s Bolinas-based press Big Sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbridge.org/bol-11.htm|title=Dreaming As One, by Kevin Opstedal - Chapter 11|website=Bigbridge.org|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==1972-75: Chicago & Essex==\nIn 1972, Notley married Berrigan and the two moved to Chicago where Berrigan had been given [[Ed Dorn]]'s newly vacated teaching position at [[Northeastern Illinois University]].  Notley and Berrigan joined an already active community of Chicago poets, including [[Paul Carroll (poet)|Paul Carroll]], [[Paul Hoover]], and [[Maxine Chernoff]]. Notley gave birth to their first son, [[Anselm Berrigan]], named after Anselm Hollo, in 1972, as well.\n\nAt Berrigan's behest, his students at Northeastern became very active members of the local poetry scene, starting magazines and reading series.  One group of students\u2014Darlene Pearlstein, Peter Kostakis, and Richard Friedman\u2014started a small poetry press, The Yellow Press, which would go on to publish two books by Notley, one book by Berrigan, and give out a yearly Ted Berrigan Prize\u2014overseen in part by Notley\u2014for a first book (though the press would cease publishing two years in).  Young poets on the Chicago scene regularly hung out with Notley and Berrigan at their home and many followed the couple back to New York City in the late 70s.  The circle of younger poets who spent time with Notley and Berrigan included the aforementioned members of the Yellow Press team, Barbara Barg, Rochelle Kraut, Rose Lesniak, Bob Rosenthal, Steve Levine, Simon Schuchat, Tim Milk, and several others.<ref>Interview with Barbara Barg, Rose Lesniak, and Tim Milk.  November 2014.</ref>\n\nWhile in Chicago, Notley started publishing her magazine ''Chicago'', a legal-sized mimeograph publication which would continue through both her pregnancies and even her relocation to England.  Notley began the magazine to connect with preexisting poet friends and meet new writers on both coasts while living in the midwest.  The magazine ran for eight issues, three of which were published while Notley and Berrigan lived in England.  Notley edited seven of the issues with Berrigan taking over one while Notley was pregnant with their first son.  The artist [[George Schneeman]], perhaps most famous for his artworks that appeared on the covers of dozens of books of poetry, did all of the covers for the magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theconversant.org/?p=5891 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903175752/http://theconversant.org/?p=5891 |archive-date=September 3, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Berrigan got a job as a visiting poet at [[University of Essex]], so Notley and Berrigan, with their son Anselm, relocated first to [[London]], then to [[Brightlingsea]] in [[Essex]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://barzakh.net/site/issue-01/286 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908091945/http://barzakh.net/site/issue-01/286 |archivedate=September 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  While in England, Notley would write her second sonnet cycle ''Great Interiors, Wines and Spirits of the World,'' which was originally published in a Notley-themed issue of the Chicago magazine Out There.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onedit.net/issue5/alicen/24.html|title=onedit 5 - Alice Notley : GREAT INTERIORS, WINES AND SPIRITS OF THE WORLD|website=Onedit.net|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom February through June 1974 in [[Wivenhoe]], Essex, Notley wrote her book ''Songs for the Unborn Second Baby'' (United Artists, 1979). While Notley had written on motherhood prior to ''Songs'', this book was her first to focus fully on the matter and is the first full-length book of a [[New York School (art)|New York School]]-affiliated poet to take on the task of addressing poetry's sexism and the pressures and setbacks of motherhood in both personal and creative life. ''Songs for the Unborn Second Baby'' is currently not fully in print. There are seven pages in Notley's book ''Grave of Light: New and Selected Poems''. Notley gave birth to her and Berrigan's second child, [[Edmund Berrigan]], at Colchester Hospital in 1974.\n\nThe couple returned to Chicago for a brief period of time after their year in England before moving to New York City in 1976.\n\n==1976-92: New York City==\n1976 saw Notley and Berrigan moving their family permanently to New York City's [[Lower East Side]], where they'd live together until Berrigan's death in 1983.  Their apartment at 101 St. Mark's Place again became a hub for both young writers and Berrigan and Notley's contemporaries.  Notley remained fairly prolific during this era, writing and publishing several full-length collections.  Perpetually strapped for cash, the two took on whatever small jobs they could to support the family.  Notley and Berrigan were frequent instructors at [[Naropa University]]'s summer writing program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/naropa?sort=titleSorter|title=Naropa Poetics Audio Archives : Free Audio : Free Download, Borrow and Streaming : Internet Archive|website=Archive.org|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>  Some of Notley's most famous engagements with the poetry community while in NYC were her workshops at the [[Poetry Project]] at St. Mark's Church, which were attended by dozens of young poets including [[Bob Holman]], [[Patricia Spears Jones]], [[Steve Carey]], and Susie Timmons. [[Eileen Myles]] wrote of her experience in Notley's workshops in her books ''Chelsea Girls'' (Black Sparrow Press, 2004; Ecco, 2015) and ''Inferno'' (O/R Books, 2010). Of her 1983 workshop, Notley wrote:\n\n{{Quote|text=I expect my workshop will be similar to past Alice Notley workshops: same old format, assignments, xeroxes, forms, occasions, geometries, kinds of poems, speculations on and practice of the lofty and the silly.  I assume I've learned a little more since the last time I taught, and that I've a little more to learn in the teaching.  If not, boo hoo.  Other possible issues: goofy works, \"description,\" dreams (the new gen), school of Susie Timmons, rejuvenation of the \"found work,\" the \"line,\" how to be like Elinor [Nauen] and Maggie [Dubris], how to cultivate inventiveness, strategies for dry spell, dictionaries, diaries, little plays, calligrams, tiles, left-hand margins, how to get great theories and general self-improvement. \n<ref>[http://cassandragillig.tumblr.com/post/105654929667/1983]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Notley led a workshop where participants were required to write an entire book during the course of their meetings.  After the workshop ended, Notley teamed up with students to print copies of their works on the mimeograph machine in the St. Mark's basement.  The books were published under the imprint Unimproved Editions and Notley made cover art for the majority of the titles.<ref>Reading in Buffalo, New York, April 10, 1987</ref>  Her own book, entitled ''Parts of a Wedding,'' was published first in a small edition by Unimproved Editions then later as a section of the O Books anthology ''O One.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obookspoetry.org/o-onean-anthology/|title=O Books Poetry is under construction|publisher=|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBerrigan's death in 1983 struck the poetry community exceptionally hard and over the next decade, Notley would suffer the loss of many others who were close to her.  Notley's 1985 play \"Anne's White Glove,\" a commission by [[Ada Katz]]'s [[Eye and Ear Theater]] navigated the pain of Berrigan's death, and her collections ''Margaret & Dusty'' (Coffee House, 1985), ''Parts of a Wedding'' (Unimproved Editions, 1986), and ''At Night the States'' (The Yellow Press, 1987) contain material written during a period of mourning.  Notley's elegiac work during this era, including her poems \"Beginning With a Stain\" and \"At Night the States,\" is some of her most widely celebrated.\n\n==1992-present: Paris==\n\nIn 1992, Notley moved to [[Paris]] with her second husband, the British poet and novelist [[Douglas Oliver]] (1937\u20132000), whom she met while living in England in 1974.  The two worked on two magazines together, Gare du Nord and Scarlet, and self-published a compendium of their own books, ''The Scarlet Cabinet,'' which contained Notley's ''Descent of Alette.'' ''Descent'' would grow to be Notley's most widely read and taught collection after its reprinting by Penguin in 1996. Notley has remained in Paris but makes several trips to the United States each year to give readings and teach small workshops. Some have linked Notley's geographical move to Paris\u2014since it followed a period of intensely personal writing\u2014as also marking a creative distance between herself and her poems, though her books ''Mysteries of Small Houses'' (Penguin, 1998) and ''Culture of One'' (Penguin, 2011) engage very much with personal matter.\n\nIn 1999, Notley was both a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a winner of the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] for Poetry.

While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the sarcastic \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J.

The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem, but that he did not attend the funeral simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no.\" In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007.

While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the sarcastic \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show.\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Spade revived \"Hollywood Minute\" inside a segment called \"Spade in America\"; Spade joked, \"Look, children, it's a falling star.

He returned to host an episode in 1998 and another in 2005.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\nSpade's film career began in 1987 with an appearance in [[Police Academy 4]]. He starred with fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Farley]] in two [[buddy comedy]] films, ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' (1995) and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' (1996). The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem, but that he did not attend the funeral simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no.\" In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007. On the show, Spade made fun of Hollywood and celebrities in a manner similar to his old \"Hollywood Minute\" segment on ''SNL''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070811085702/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/10/the_showbiz_show_with_david_spade_comedy_central_s.php The Showbiz Show with David Spade: Comedy Central Series Cancelled] , ''TVSeriesFinale.com''.

He decided that if his career went nowhere he would still have a chance to try something else.<ref name=\"The Age\"/> He began taking [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]] classes, where he met his future wife [[Deb Lacusta]]. He started to work at [[The Second City]], an improvisational theatre in [[Chicago]], in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987.<ref name=\"matthau\"/> During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations.<ref name=\"The Age\"/>\n\nHe auditioned for a role in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' and his first meeting underwhelmed [[Tracey Ullman]] and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a [[Visual impairment|blind]] man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.<ref name=\"matthau\"/>\n\n===''The Simpsons''===\nCastellaneta is most famous for his role as [[Homer Simpson]] on the longest running animated television show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' included a series of animated shorts about a [[dysfunctional family]]. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member [[Julie Kavner]] to voice Homer and [[Marge Simpson]] rather than hire more actors.<ref name=\"The Age\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html|title=D'oh, you're the voice|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=February 27, 2003|author=Lee, Luaine|work=[[The Age]]|location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref name=\"FN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129665,00.html|title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=August 18, 2007|author=Elber, Lynn|publisher=[[Fox News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703090128/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C129665%2C00.html|archive-date=July 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Homer's voice began as a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]], but Castellaneta could not \"get enough power behind that voice\" and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers|accessdate=February 15, 2009|date=July 26, 2007|author=Carroll, Larry|publisher=[[MTV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|archivedate=December 20, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe tried to find something easier, so he \"dropped the voice down\", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show.<ref name=\"matthau\">{{cite news|url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta99.html|author=Brownfield, Paul|title=He's Homer, but This Odyssey Is His Own|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 6, 1999|accessdate=February 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004132/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta99.html|archivedate=May 12, 2008}}</ref> Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's.<ref name=\"Aspen\">{{cite news|author=Harden, Mark|url=http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta00.html|title='Simpsons' voice Dan Castellaneta has some surprises for Aspen fest|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=February 9, 2000|accessdate=February 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710115213/http://www.snpp.com/other/interviews/castellaneta00.html|archivedate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest,<ref name=\"The Age\"/> and is said to \"let his IQ go.\"<ref name=\"Mirkin\">[[David Mirkin|Mirkin, David]].
