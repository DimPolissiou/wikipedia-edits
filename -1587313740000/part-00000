Their reservation is located near the southwest corner of [[Clallam County, Washington]], at the mouth of the [[Quillayute River]] on the [[Pacific coast]]. The reservation's main population center is the community of [[La Push, Washington]]. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] reported an official resident population of 371 people on the reservation, which has a land area of 4.061&nbsp;km\u00b2 (1.5678 sq mi, or 1,003.4 [[acre]]s).\n\nThe Quileute language belongs to the [[Chimakuan languages|Chimakuan]] family of languages among Northwest Coast indigenous peoples.

Like many other tribes in the region, they were excellent boat and canoe makers. They could make canoes for whaling, which could hold tons of cargo and many men. They had cedar canoes ranging in size from small boats that could hold two people to giant vessels up to {{convert|58|m|ft}} long and capable of holding up to 6,000 pounds. The modern [[Clipper|clipper ship]]'s hull uses a design much like the canoes used by the Quileutes. The Quileutes used the resources from the land to make tools and other items. In the region, almost everything was made out of wood. Necessities like utensils, clothing, weapons, and paints were made from the available natural resources. In terms of arts and crafts, the Quileute Tribe is best known for their woven baskets and dog-hair blankets. The tribe would raise specially bred, woolly dogs for their hair, which they would spin and weave into blankets. They would also weave incredibly fine baskets that were so tightly woven that they could hold water. They could boil water in some of them. Using cedar bark, they made waterproof skirts and hats to shield their bodies against the heavy rainfall in the region.\n\n== Ethnobotany ==\nThe Quileute have extensive knowledge of the medicinal qualities of their homelands' flora. They use [[velvetleaf huckleberries]], ''[[Vaccinium myrtilloides]]'', by eating the uncooked berries, stewing the berries to make a sauce, and canning the berries and using them as food.<ref>Reagan, Albert B., 1936, Plants Used by the Hoh and Quileute Indians, Kansas Academy of Science 37:55-70, page 67</ref>\n\n== Religion and cosmology ==\nThe Quileute's belief system holds that every person had an individual guardian.

Their first contact with Europeans occurred in 1775 when a Spanish ship missed its landing, and the Quileute enslaved the crew. This happened again in 1787 with a British ship and in 1808 with a Russian ship. The first official negotiations with the United States government occurred in 1855 when [[Isaac Stevens]] and the Quileute signed the [[Treaty of Olympia]]. They ceded great amounts of land and agreed to resettle on the Quinault Reservation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n<blockquote>ARTICLE 1.

Unlike the other provinces, Ulster has a high percentage of [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]], making up almost half of its population. English is the main language and [[Ulster English]] the main dialect. A minority also speak Irish, and there are [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking regions) in southern County Londonderry, the Gaeltacht Quarter of Belfast and in Donegal, where 25% of the total Gaeltacht population of Ireland is located.<ref>{{cite web | title=Results | website=census.cso.ie | url=http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=GA&Geog_Code=02 | access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> [[Lough Neagh]], in the east, is the largest lake in the [[British Isles]], while [[Lough Erne]] in the west is one of its largest lake networks. The main mountain ranges are the [[Mourne Mountains|Mournes]], [[Sperrins]], [[Blue Stack Mountains|Croaghgorms]] and [[Derryveagh Mountains]].\n\nHistorically, Ulster lay at the heart of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] world made up of [[Gaelic Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. According to tradition, in [[Protohistory of Ireland|ancient Ireland]] it was one of the [[Provinces of Ireland|fifths]] ({{lang-ga|c\u00faige}}) ruled by a ''[[R\u00ed#R\u00ed ruirech|r\u00ed ruirech]]'', or \"king of over-kings\". It is named after the overkingdom of [[Ulaid]], in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk. The other overkingdoms in Ulster were [[Airg\u00edalla]] and [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill|Ailech]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the 12th century, eastern Ulster was conquered by the [[Anglo-Normans]] and became the [[Earldom of Ulster]]. By the late 14th century the Earldom had collapsed and the [[O'Neill dynasty]] had come to dominate most of Ulster, claiming the title [[List of kings of Ulster|King of Ulster]]. Ulster became the most thoroughly Gaelic and independent of Ireland's provinces. Its rulers resisted [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English encroachment]] but were defeated in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). King [[James VI and I|James I]] then colonized Ulster with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Great Britain, in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns. The inflow of Protestant settlers and migrants also led to bouts of [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] violence with Catholics, notably during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 rebellion]] and the [[Armagh disturbances]]. Along with the rest of Ireland, Ulster became part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1801. In the early 20th century, moves towards [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish self-rule]] were opposed by many [[Ulster Protestants]], sparking the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. This, and the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]], led to the [[partition of Ireland]]. Six Ulster counties became Northern Ireland, a self-governing territory within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the [[Irish Free State]], now the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe term ''Ulster'' has no official function for local government purposes in either country. However, for the purposes of [[ISO 3166-2]], ''Ulster'' is used to refer to the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan only, which are given country sub-division code \"IE-U\".<ref>ISO 3166-2 Newsletter II-1, 19 February 2010, which gives \"Ulster\" as the official English name and \"Ulaidh\" as the official Irish name of the province, citing \"Ordnance Survey Office, Dublin 1993\" as its source \u2013 [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-1_corrected_2010-02-19.pdf]</ref> The name is also used by various organisations such as cultural and sporting bodies.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe [[Place names in Irish|name]] ''Ulster'' has several possible derivations: from the [[Norse language|Norse]] name \u2018Uladztir\u2019, which is an adaptation of ''Ulaidh'' and ''tir'', the [[Irish language|Irish]] for \u2019land\u2019;<ref name=\"Bardon\">Jonathan Bardon; ''A History of Ulster'', page 27.

Gill & Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-7171-6207-9}}</ref> It has also been suggested to have derived from ''Uladh'' plus the Norse suffix ''ster'' (meaning place), which was common in the [[Shetland Islands]] and [[Norway]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/wordsandplaceso04taylgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/wordsandplaceso04taylgoog/page/n222 182] |author=Rev.

About 62% of the area of Ulster is in the UK while the remaining 38% is in the Republic of Ireland. Ulster's biggest city, [[Belfast]], has an urban population of over half a million inhabitants, making it the [[List of settlements on the island of Ireland by population|second-largest city on the island of Ireland]] and the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|10th largest urban area]] in the UK. <!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry. \n-->\nSix of Ulster's nine [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], including the former parliamentary boroughs of [[Belfast]] and [[Londonderry (parliamentary borough)|Londonderry]], form [[Northern Ireland]] which remained part of the United Kingdom after the [[partition of Ireland]] in 1921. Three Ulster counties \u2013 [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Donegal|Donegal]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] \u2013 form part of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. About half of Ulster's population lives in counties Antrim and Down. Across the nine counties, according to the aggregate UK [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] for Northern Ireland, and the ROI 2011 Census for counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, there is a [[Roman Catholic]] majority over [[Protestant]] of 50.8% to 42.7%.<ref>\"Community Background\", 2011 Census, for NI, and \"Religion\", 2011 Census, for RoI</ref>\n\nWhile the traditional counties continue to demarcate areas of [[local government in the Republic of Ireland]], this is no longer the case in Northern Ireland.

The longest river in the British Isles, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], rises at the [[Shannon Pot]] in County Cavan with underground tributaries from County Fermanagh. [[Volcano|Volcanic activity]] in eastern Ulster led to the formation of the [[Antrim Plateau]] and the [[Giant's Causeway]], one of Ireland's three [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Ulster also has a significant [[drumlin]] belt.  The geographical centre of Ulster lies between the villages of [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone|Pomeroy]] and [[Carrickmore]] in County Tyrone. In terms of area, County Donegal is the largest county in all of Ulster.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:House through the Arch.jpg|At White Park Bay\nFile:Countryside west of Ballynahinch - geograph.org.uk - 466768.jpg|Countryside west of Ballynahinch\nFile:Mourne country cottage. - geograph.org.uk - 495183.jpg|Mourne country cottage\nFile:Downshire Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 645687.jpg|Downshire Bridge Crossing the bay to Murlough\nFile:Cattle near Six Road Ends - geograph.org.uk - 435763.jpg|Cattle near Six Road Ends Seen from the Kirkistown to Ballyeaseborough Road\nFile:The Twelve Arches near Dundrum - geograph.org.uk - 442408.jpg|The Twelve Arches near Dundrum\nFile:Fintown Railway on trackbed of CDR County Donegal Railway, Lough Finn (5951398952).jpg|The track of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee|County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC)]] restored next to [[Lough Finn]], near [[Fintown railway station|Fintown station]].\nFile:Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich. - geograph.org.uk - 452580.jpg|Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich\nFile:The approach of autumn, Tardree forest - geograph.org.uk - 943055.jpg|The approach of autumn, Tardree forest\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Air===\nThe province's main airport is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly called Aldergrove Airport), which is located at [[Aldergrove, Northern Ireland|Aldergrove]], 11.5 miles northwest of Belfast near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] (sometimes referred to as \"the City Airport\" or \"the Harbour Airport\") is another, smaller airport which is located at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in Belfast.

The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Conghal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.\n\nIn early medieval Ireland, a branch of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] of the province of [[Ailech]], gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the [[River Bann]]. The Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain would make T\u00edr E\u00f3ghain (most of which forms modern [[County Tyrone]]) their base. Among the [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] were [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] (died 879), [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] (died 919), and [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]] (died 980), all of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], when the [[O'Neill]]s who had come to dominate the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of \"king of Ulster\" along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.\n\n[[File:Bronze statue - geograph.org.uk - 821113.jpg|260px|thumb|A bronze statue commemorating The [[Flight of the Earls]] at [[Rathmullan]] in north [[County Donegal]].]]\n[[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] (died 1121) and [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The [[Meic Lochlainn]] were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (see [[O'Neill dynasty]]). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's were from then on established as Ulster's most powerful Gaelic family.\n\nThe \u00d3 Domhnaill ([[O'Donnell]]) dynasty were Ulster's second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century. The O'Donnells ruled over [[T\u00edr Chonaill]] (most of modern County Donegal) in West Ulster.\n\nAfter the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] of Ireland in the twelfth century, the east of the province fell by conquest to Norman barons, first [[John de Courcy|De Courcy]] (died 1219), then [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] (1176\u20131243), who founded the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]] based on the modern counties of Antrim and Down.\n\nIn the 1600s Ulster was the last redoubt of the traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] way of life, and following the defeat of the Irish forces in the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1594\u20131603) at the [[battle of Kinsale]] (1601), [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s English forces succeeded in subjugating Ulster and all of Ireland.\n\nThe Gaelic leaders of Ulster, the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]] and [[O'Donnell]]s, finding their power under English [[suzerainty]] limited, decamped ''en masse'' in 1607 (the [[Flight of the Earls]]) to [[Roman Catholic]] Europe. This allowed the [[British monarchy|English Crown]] to plant Ulster with more loyal English and Scottish [[Plantations of Ireland|planter]]s, a process which began in earnest in 1610.\n\n===Plantations and civil wars===\n<!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry.\n-->\nThe [[Plantation of Ulster]] ({{lang-gle|Pland\u00e1il Uladh}}) was the organised [[colonisation]] (or [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]]) of Ulster by people from Great Britain (especially [[Presbyterians]] from [[Scotland]]).

This Rebellion was initially led by [[Phelim O'Neill|Sir Phelim O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Sir F\u00e9ilim \u00d3 N\u00e9ill''), and was intended to overthrow British rule rapidly, but quickly degenerated into attacks on colonists, in which dispossessed Irish slaughtered thousands of the colonists. In the ensuing [[Irish Confederate Wars|wars]] (1641\u20131653, fought against the background of [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil war]] in England, Scotland and Ireland), Ulster became a battleground between the Colonialists and the native Irish. In 1646, an Irish army under command by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Eoghan Ruadh \u00d3 N\u00e9ill'') inflicted a defeat on a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army at [[battle of Benburb|Benburb]] in County Tyrone, but the native Irish forces failed to follow up their victory and the war lapsed into stalemate. The war in Ulster ended with the defeat of the native army at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]], near Newmills on the western outskirts of [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]], in 1650, as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] conducted by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[New Model Army]], the aim of which was to expel all native Irish to the Province of [[Connacht|Connaught]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro100.shtml|title=BBC Short History}}</ref>\n\nForty years later, in 1688\u20131691, the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] was fought, the belligerents of which were the [[Williamite]]s and [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The war was partly due to a dispute over who was the rightful claimant to the [[British Throne]], and thus the supreme monarch of the nascent [[British Empire]]. However, the war was also a part of the greater [[War of the Grand Alliance]], fought between [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] and his allies, and a European-wide coalition, the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], led by [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire]], supported by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and many other states. The Grand Alliance was a cross-denominational alliance designed to stop French eastward colonialist expansion under Louis XIV, with whom [[James II of England|King James II]] was allied.\n\nThe majority of Irish people were \"Jacobites\" and supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685\u20131720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6\u2013111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|jstor = 30064327}}</ref> However, James II was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the majority of Ulster [[Colonialists]] ([[Williamite]]s) backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]].

The Jacobites [[Siege of Derry|besieged Derry]] from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the [[battle of Newtownbutler]] on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William's forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] with the iconic victories of the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1 July 1690) and the [[Battle of Aughrim]] (12 July 1691), all of which the [[Orange Order]] commemorate each year.\n\nThe Williamites' victory in this war ensured British rule in Ireland for over 200 years. The [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland excluded most of Ulster's population from having any Civil [[power (sociology)|power]] on religious grounds. [[Roman Catholics]] (descended from the indigenous Irish) and [[Presbyterians]] (mainly descended from Scottish colonists) both suffered discrimination under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which gave full political rights only to [[Anglican]] Protestants (mostly descended from English settlers). In the 1690s, Scottish Presbyterians became a majority in Ulster, due to a large influx of them into the Province.\n\n===Emigration===\nConsiderable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies throughout the 18th century (160,000 settled in what would become the United States between 1717 and 1770 alone).\n\nDisdaining (or forced out of) the heavily English regions on the Atlantic coast, most groups of Ulster-Scots settlers crossed into the \"western mountains,\" where their descendants populated the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] regions and the [[Ohio Valley]]. Here they lived on the frontiers of America, carving their own world out of the wilderness. The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from [[Pennsylvania]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Author (and US Senator) [[Jim Webb]] puts forth a thesis in his book ''Born Fighting'' to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scots-Irish such as loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and a propensity to bear arms, helped shape the American identity.\n\nIn the [[United States Census, 2000]], 4.3 million Americans claimed Scots-Irish ancestry.  The areas where the most Americans reported themselves in the 2000 Census only as \"American\" with no further qualification (e.g. [[Kentucky]], north-central [[Texas]], and many other areas in the [[Southern US]]) are largely the areas where many Scots-Irish settled, and are in complementary distribution with the areas which most heavily report Scots-Irish ancestry.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, 400,000 people in the US were of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 when the first US Census counted 3,100,000 white Americans.  According to the encyclopaedia, half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Republicanism, rebellion and communal strife===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nMost of the 18th century saw a calming of sectarian tensions in Ulster. The economy of the province improved, as small producers exported linen and other goods. Belfast developed from a village into a bustling provincial town. However, this did not stop many thousands of Ulster people from emigrating to [[British North America]] in this period, where they became known as \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scots Irish]]\" or \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPolitical tensions resurfaced, albeit in a new form, towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1790s many Roman Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], in opposition to [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican domination]] and inspired by the American and French [[revolutions]] joined together in the [[United Irishmen]] movement. This group (founded in Belfast) dedicated itself to founding a non-[[sectarian]] and independent Irish republic. The United Irishmen had particular strength in [[Belfast]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Down|Down]]. Paradoxically however, this period also saw much sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, principally members of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglicans, who practised the British state religion and had rights denied to both Presbyterians and Roman Catholics), notably the \"[[Battle of the Diamond]]\" in 1795, a faction fight between the rival \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\" (Roman Catholic) and \"[[Peep O'Day Boys]]\" (Anglican), which led to over 100 deaths and to the founding of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. This event, and many others like it, came about with the relaxation of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and Roman Catholics began to be allowed to purchase land and involve themselves in the linen trade (activities which previously had involved many onerous restrictions). Protestants, including some Presbyterians, who in some parts of the province had come to identify with the Roman Catholic community, used violence to intimidate Roman Catholics who tried to enter the linen trade. Estimates suggest that up to 7000 Roman Catholics suffered expulsion from Ulster during this violence. Many of them settled in northern [[Connacht]]. These refugees' linguistic influence still survives in the dialects of Irish spoken in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which have many similarities to [[Ulster Irish]] not found elsewhere in Connacht. Loyalist militias, primarily [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], also used violence against the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] and against Roman Catholic and Protestant [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] throughout the province.\n\nIn 1798 the United Irishmen, led by [[Henry Joy McCracken]], launched a rebellion in Ulster, mostly supported by Presbyterians. But the British authorities swiftly put down the rebellion and employed severe repression after the fighting had ended. In the wake of the failure of this [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]], and following the gradual abolition of official religious discrimination after the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1800, [[Presbyterians]] came to identify more with the State and with their Anglican neighbours, due to their civil rights now being respected by both the state and their Anglican neighbours.\n\nThe [[1859 Ulster Revival]] was a major [[Christian revival]] that spread throughout Ulster.\n\n===Industrialisation, Home Rule and partition===\n[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]]. [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890\u20131900.]]\nIn the 19th century, Ulster had the only large-scale industrialisation and became the most prosperous province on the island.  In the latter part of the century, [[Belfast]] briefly overtook [[Dublin]] as the island's largest city. Belfast became famous in this period for its huge [[dockyard]]s and [[shipbuilding]] \u2014 and notably for the construction of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. [[Sectarian]] divisions in Ulster became hardened into the political categories of ''[[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]]'' (supporters of the Union with Britain; mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant) and ''[[Irish nationalist|nationalist]]'' (advocates of repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, usually, though not exclusively, Roman Catholic). Northern Ireland's current politics originate from these late 19th century disputes over [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] that would have devolved some powers of government to Ireland, and which Ulster Protestants usually opposed\u2014fearing for their religious rights calling it \"Rome Rule\" in an autonomous Roman Catholic-dominated Ireland and also not trusting politicians from the agrarian south and west to support the more industrial economy of Ulster. This lack of trust, however, was largely unfounded as during the 19th and early 20th century important industries in the southern most region of Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and like Belfast, shipbuilding.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/32717516/1919-Cork-Its-Trade-and-Commerce| pg 168</ref>\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|230px|right|The results of the [[1918 Irish general election]], in which [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] won the majority of votes on the island of Ireland, shown in the color green and light green respectively, with the exception being primarily in the East of the province of Ulster.]]\nThousands of unionists, led by the Dublin-born barrister [[Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], signed the \"[[Ulster Covenant]]\" of 1912 pledging to resist Home Rule. This movement also set up the [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF). In April 1914, the UVF assisted with the landing of 30,000 [[Imperial Germany|German]] rifles with 3,000,000 rounds at [[Larne]] by blockading authorities.  (See [[Larne gunrunning]]). The [[Curragh Incident]] showed it would be difficult to use the British army to enforce home rule from Dublin on Ulster's unionist minority.\n\nIn response, Irish republicans created the [[Irish Volunteers]], part of which became the forerunner of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) \u2014 to seek to ensure the passing of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Upon the outbreak of [[Ireland and World War I|World War I]] in 1914, 200,000 Irishmen, both Southern and Northern, of all religious sects volunteered to serve in the [[British Army]]. This had the effect of interrupting the armed stand-off in Ireland. As the war progressed, in Ireland, opposition to the War grew stronger, reaching its peak in 1918 when the British government proposed laws to extend [[conscription]] to all able bodied Irishmen during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|Conscription Crisis]].\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the political party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] (\"Ourselves\") won the majority of votes in the [[1918 Irish general election]], this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the [[Sinn F\u00e9in Manifesto 1918|Sinn F\u00e9in campaign Manifesto of 1918]], a great deal more than the devolved government/[[Home Rule]] advocated by the (I.P.P) [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Following the Sinn F\u00e9in victory in these elections the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]] was penned and [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republicans]] launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the [[Irish War of Independence]] (January 1919 \u2013 July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally took the form of street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, with the exception of the south [[County Armagh|Armagh]] area, where [[Frank Aiken]] led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in [[County Donegal]] and the City of [[Derry]], where one of the main Republican leaders was [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. Hugh O'Doherty, a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the [[First D\u00e1il]], which was elected in late 1918, Prof. [[Eoin Mac N\u00e9ill]] served as the Sinn F\u00e9in T.D. for [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]].\n\n===1920 to present===\n{{main|History of Northern Ireland}}\n{{see also|Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}\n[[Partition of Ireland]], first mooted in 1912, was introduced with the enactment of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], which gave a form of \"Home rule\" self-government to two areas, [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]], with its capital at [[Dublin]], and \"[[Northern Ireland]]\", consisting of six of Ulster's central and eastern counties, both within a continuing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Dissatisfaction with this led to the [[Irish War of Independence]], which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]] (which later became the sovereign [[Republic of Ireland]]), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties knew that this was certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.\n\nFollowing the Anglo Irish treaty, the exact border between the new dominion of the Irish Free State and the future [[Northern Ireland]], if it chose to opt out, was to be decided by the [[Irish Boundary Commission]]. This did not announce its findings until 1925, when the line was again drawn around six of Ulster's nine counties, with no change from the partition of 1920.\n\nElectorally, voting in the six [[Northern Ireland]] counties of Ulster tends to follow religious or sectarian lines; noticeable religious demarcation does not exist in the South Ulster counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. County Donegal is largely a Roman Catholic county, but with a large [[Protestant]] minority. Generally, Protestants in Donegal vote for the political party [[Fine Gael]] (\"Family of the Irish\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladlass.com/intel/archives/006991.html |title=The Future's Bright For Donegal's Orangemen |accessdate=6 June 2008 |publisher=Independent News And Media |date=11 July 2004 }}</ref> However, religious sectarianism in politics has largely disappeared from the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This was illustrated when [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], a [[Church of Ireland]] member and [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD, a member of the lower house of the National Parliament) who had represented Monaghan, won election as [[President of Ireland|President]] after having served as a long-term minister under [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] and [[Jack Lynch]].\n\nThe [[Orange Order]] freely organises in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, with several Orange parades taking place throughout County Donegal each year. The only major Orange Order march in the [[Republic of Ireland]] takes place every July in the village of [[Rossnowlagh]], near [[Ballyshannon]], in the south of County Donegal.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland has seven Roman Catholic members of parliament, all members of Sinn F\u00e9in (of a total of 18 from the whole of Northern Ireland) in the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]; and the other three counties have one Protestant T.D. of the ten it has elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the Lower House of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. At present (August 2007) County Donegal sends six T.D.'s to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The county is divided into two constituencies: Donegal North-East and Donegal South-West, each with three T.D.'s. County Cavan and County Monaghan form the one constituency called Cavan-Monaghan, which sends five T.D.'s to the D\u00e1il (one of whom is a Protestant).\n\nThe historic [[Flag of Ulster]] served as the basis for the [[Ulster Banner]] (often referred to as the Flag of Northern Ireland), which was the flag of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] until the proroguing of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament in 1973.\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nWilliam Sherard (1659\u20131728) was the first biologist in Ulster.<ref>Deane, C.D. 1983.

In football, the main competitions in which they compete with the other Irish counties are the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], while the Ulster club champions represent the province in the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]]. Hurling teams play in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], [[National Hurling League]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The whole province fields a team to play the other provinces in the [[Railway Cup]] in both football and hurling. Gaelic Football is by far the most popular of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports in Ulster but hurling is also played, especially in [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]], [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]], [[Derry GAA|Derry]], and [[Down GAA|Down]].\n\nThe border has divided association football teams since 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=47|title=Football Association of Ireland|website=www.fai.ie}}</ref> The [[Irish Football Association]] (the I.F.A.) oversees the sport in N.I., while the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the F.A.I.) oversees the sport in the Republic. As a result, separate international teams are fielded and separate championships take place ([[Irish Football League]] in Northern Ireland, [[League of Ireland]] in the rest of Ulster and Ireland). Anomalously, [[Derry City F.C.]] has played in the League of Ireland since 1985 due to crowd trouble at some of their Irish League matches prior to this. The other major Ulster team in the League of Ireland is [[Finn Harps]] of [[Ballybofey]], County Donegal. When Derry City F.C. and Finn Harps play against each other, the game is usually referred to as a 'North-West Derby'. There have been cup competitions between I.F.A. and F.A.I. clubs, most recently the [[Setanta Sports Cup]].\n\nIn [[Rugby union]], the professional rugby team representing the province and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union|IRFU]] Ulster Branch, [[Ulster Rugby]], compete in the [[Pro14]] along with teams from [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], Italy, South Africa and the other Irish Provinces ([[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] and [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]]). They also compete in Europe's main club rugby tournament, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which they won (as the Heineken Cup) back in 1999. Notable Ulster rugby players include Willy John McBride, [[Jack Kyle]] and [[Mike Gibson (rugby union)|Mike Gibson]]. The former is the most capped [[British and Irish Lions|British and Irish Lion]] of all time, having completed four tours with the Lions in the sixties and seventies. At international level players from Ulster join with those from the other 3 provinces to form the Irish national team. They do not sing the Irish national anthem but do sing a special song which has been written celebrating the \"4 proud provinces\" before matches start.\n\nThe [[Ulster Hockey Union]] organises [[field hockey]] in the province and contributes substantially to the all-island hockey team.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/50209912 | title = Ireland hockey: Seven Ulster players in squad for Olympic qualifier against Canada | work = BBC Sport | date = 28 October 2019 | accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket]] is also played in Ulster, especially in Northern Ireland and East Donegal.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RPtXDMarWTEC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=cricket+belfast+protestant|title=Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images|first1=John|last1=McGarry|first2=Brendan|last2=O'Leary|date=8 June 1995|publisher=Wiley|via=Google Books|isbn=9780631183495}}</ref> Ulster enters two teams into the [[Cricket in Ireland#Inter-Provincial Series|Interprovincial Series]]; the [[Northern Knights (cricket team)|North Knights]] and the [[North West Warriors]], who are the respective representative teams of the [[Northern Cricket Union]] (NCU) and the [[North West Cricket Union]] (NWCU).\n\nGolf is, however, by far the most high-profile sport and the sport that Ulster has succeeded at more than any other. Ulster has produced many great players over the years, from [[Fred Daly (golfer)|Fred Daly]] winning The Open Championship in 1947 at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake to most recently [[Rory McIlroy]] winning the US Open and [[Darren Clarke]] winning The Open Championship in 2011. Ulster also has another Major winner in [[Graeme McDowell]], who also won the US Open in 2010.  The Open Championship returned to Ulster, after 68 years, in 2019 at [[Royal Portrush Golf Club]].\n\nIn horse racing, specifically National Hunt, Ulster has produced the most dominant jockey of all time, [[Tony McCoy]].\n\nThe [[Circuit of Ireland Rally]] is an annual [[auto racing|automobile]] [[rallying|rally]] held in Ulster since 1931.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Northern Ireland|Ireland}}\n* [[Ulster nationalism]]\n* [[Kings of Ulster]]\n* [[List of Ulster-related topics]]\n* [[Ulster-Scots people]]\n* [[Plantations of Ireland]]\n* [[Culture of Ulster]]\n* [[Ulster GAA]]\n* [[Red Hand of Ulster]]\n* [[Ulidia (kingdom)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Deane, C.

The main mountain ranges are the [[Mourne Mountains|Mournes]], [[Sperrins]], [[Blue Stack Mountains|Croaghgorms]] and [[Derryveagh Mountains]].\n\nHistorically, Ulster lay at the heart of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] world made up of [[Gaelic Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. According to tradition, in [[Protohistory of Ireland|ancient Ireland]] it was one of the [[Provinces of Ireland|fifths]] ({{lang-ga|c\u00faige}}) ruled by a ''[[R\u00ed#R\u00ed ruirech|r\u00ed ruirech]]'', or \"king of over-kings\". It is named after the overkingdom of [[Ulaid]], in the east of the province, which was in turn named after the Ulaid folk. The other overkingdoms in Ulster were [[Airg\u00edalla]] and [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill|Ailech]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in the 12th century, eastern Ulster was conquered by the [[Anglo-Normans]] and became the [[Earldom of Ulster]]. By the late 14th century the Earldom had collapsed and the [[O'Neill dynasty]] had come to dominate most of Ulster, claiming the title [[List of kings of Ulster|King of Ulster]]. Ulster became the most thoroughly Gaelic and independent of Ireland's provinces. Its rulers resisted [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|English encroachment]] but were defeated in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594\u20131603). King [[James VI and I|James I]] then colonized Ulster with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Great Britain, in the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns. The inflow of Protestant settlers and migrants also led to bouts of [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] violence with Catholics, notably during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 rebellion]] and the [[Armagh disturbances]]. Along with the rest of Ireland, Ulster became part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1801. In the early 20th century, moves towards [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish self-rule]] were opposed by many [[Ulster Protestants]], sparking the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. This, and the subsequent [[Irish War of Independence]], led to the [[partition of Ireland]]. Six Ulster counties became Northern Ireland, a self-governing territory within the United Kingdom, while the rest of Ireland became the [[Irish Free State]], now the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe term ''Ulster'' has no official function for local government purposes in either country.

The province's highest point, [[Slieve Donard]] ({{convert|848|m|ft}}), stands in County Down. The most northerly point in Ireland, [[Malin Head]], is in County Donegal, as are the sixth-highest ({{convert|601|m|ft}}) sea [[cliffs]] in Europe, at [[Slieve League]], and the province's largest island, [[Arranmore]]. The most easterly point in Ireland is also in Ulster, in [[County Down]], and the most westerly point in the UK is in [[County Fermanagh]]. The longest river in the British Isles, the [[River Shannon|Shannon]], rises at the [[Shannon Pot]] in County Cavan with underground tributaries from County Fermanagh. [[Volcano|Volcanic activity]] in eastern Ulster led to the formation of the [[Antrim Plateau]] and the [[Giant's Causeway]], one of Ireland's three [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Ulster also has a significant [[drumlin]] belt.  The geographical centre of Ulster lies between the villages of [[Pomeroy, County Tyrone|Pomeroy]] and [[Carrickmore]] in County Tyrone. In terms of area, County Donegal is the largest county in all of Ulster.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:House through the Arch.jpg|At White Park Bay\nFile:Countryside west of Ballynahinch - geograph.org.uk - 466768.jpg|Countryside west of Ballynahinch\nFile:Mourne country cottage. - geograph.org.uk - 495183.jpg|Mourne country cottage\nFile:Downshire Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 645687.jpg|Downshire Bridge Crossing the bay to Murlough\nFile:Cattle near Six Road Ends - geograph.org.uk - 435763.jpg|Cattle near Six Road Ends Seen from the Kirkistown to Ballyeaseborough Road\nFile:The Twelve Arches near Dundrum - geograph.org.uk - 442408.jpg|The Twelve Arches near Dundrum\nFile:Fintown Railway on trackbed of CDR County Donegal Railway, Lough Finn (5951398952).jpg|The track of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee|County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC)]] restored next to [[Lough Finn]], near [[Fintown railway station|Fintown station]].\nFile:Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich. - geograph.org.uk - 452580.jpg|Wild Goats on Binnein Fithich\nFile:The approach of autumn, Tardree forest - geograph.org.uk - 943055.jpg|The approach of autumn, Tardree forest\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Air===\nThe province's main airport is [[Belfast International Airport]] (popularly called Aldergrove Airport), which is located at [[Aldergrove, Northern Ireland|Aldergrove]], 11.5 miles northwest of Belfast near [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]]. [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] (sometimes referred to as \"the City Airport\" or \"the Harbour Airport\") is another, smaller airport which is located at [[Sydenham railway station, Northern Ireland|Sydenham]] in Belfast.

Its [[Place names in Irish|name]] derives from the [[Irish language]] ''C\u00faige Uladh'' (pronounced \"Kooi-gah UH-loo\"), meaning \"fifth of the [[Ulaid]]h\", named for the ancient inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe province's early story extends further back than written records and survives mainly in legends such as the [[Ulster Cycle]].\nThe [[archaeology]] of Ulster, formerly called Ulandia, gives examples of \"ritual enclosures\", such as the \"Giant's Ring\" near Belfast, which is an earth bank about 590&nbsp;feet (180 m) in diameter and 15&nbsp;feet (4.5 m) high, in the centre of which there is a [[dolmen]].<ref name=\"Riordain 66\">{{cite book|last=Riordain|first=S.

The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Conghal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.\n\nIn early medieval Ireland, a branch of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] of the province of [[Ailech]], gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the [[River Bann]]. The Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain would make T\u00edr E\u00f3ghain (most of which forms modern [[County Tyrone]]) their base. Among the [[High King of Ireland|High Kings of Ireland]] were [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] (died 879), [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] (died 919), and [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]] (died 980), all of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], when the [[O'Neill]]s who had come to dominate the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of \"king of Ulster\" along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.\n\n[[File:Bronze statue - geograph.org.uk - 821113.jpg|260px|thumb|A bronze statue commemorating The [[Flight of the Earls]] at [[Rathmullan]] in north [[County Donegal]].]]\n[[Domnall Ua Lochlainn]] (died 1121) and [[Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn]] (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The [[Meic Lochlainn]] were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (see [[O'Neill dynasty]]). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's were from then on established as Ulster's most powerful Gaelic family.\n\nThe \u00d3 Domhnaill ([[O'Donnell]]) dynasty were Ulster's second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century. The O'Donnells ruled over [[T\u00edr Chonaill]] (most of modern County Donegal) in West Ulster.\n\nAfter the [[Norman Ireland|Norman invasion]] of Ireland in the twelfth century, the east of the province fell by conquest to Norman barons, first [[John de Courcy|De Courcy]] (died 1219), then [[Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster|Hugh de Lacy]] (1176\u20131243), who founded the [[Earl of Ulster|Earldom of Ulster]] based on the modern counties of Antrim and Down.\n\nIn the 1600s Ulster was the last redoubt of the traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] way of life, and following the defeat of the Irish forces in the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] (1594\u20131603) at the [[battle of Kinsale]] (1601), [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s English forces succeeded in subjugating Ulster and all of Ireland.\n\nThe Gaelic leaders of Ulster, the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]] and [[O'Donnell]]s, finding their power under English [[suzerainty]] limited, decamped ''en masse'' in 1607 (the [[Flight of the Earls]]) to [[Roman Catholic]] Europe. This allowed the [[British monarchy|English Crown]] to plant Ulster with more loyal English and Scottish [[Plantations of Ireland|planter]]s, a process which began in earnest in 1610.\n\n===Plantations and civil wars===\n<!-- Note to editors: the agreed compromise for the Derry/Londonderry naming dispute is that the city shall be Derry and the county shall be Londonderry.\n-->\nThe [[Plantation of Ulster]] ({{lang-gle|Pland\u00e1il Uladh}}) was the organised [[colonisation]] (or [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation]]) of Ulster by people from Great Britain (especially [[Presbyterians]] from [[Scotland]]).

This Rebellion was initially led by [[Phelim O'Neill|Sir Phelim O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Sir F\u00e9ilim \u00d3 N\u00e9ill''), and was intended to overthrow British rule rapidly, but quickly degenerated into attacks on colonists, in which dispossessed Irish slaughtered thousands of the colonists. In the ensuing [[Irish Confederate Wars|wars]] (1641\u20131653, fought against the background of [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil war]] in England, Scotland and Ireland), Ulster became a battleground between the Colonialists and the native Irish. In 1646, an Irish army under command by [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (Irish: ''Eoghan Ruadh \u00d3 N\u00e9ill'') inflicted a defeat on a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army at [[battle of Benburb|Benburb]] in County Tyrone, but the native Irish forces failed to follow up their victory and the war lapsed into stalemate. The war in Ulster ended with the defeat of the native army at the [[Battle of Scarrifholis]], near Newmills on the western outskirts of [[Letterkenny]], [[County Donegal]], in 1650, as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] conducted by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[New Model Army]], the aim of which was to expel all native Irish to the Province of [[Connacht|Connaught]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro100.shtml|title=BBC Short History}}</ref>\n\nForty years later, in 1688\u20131691, the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] was fought, the belligerents of which were the [[Williamite]]s and [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The war was partly due to a dispute over who was the rightful claimant to the [[British Throne]], and thus the supreme monarch of the nascent [[British Empire]]. However, the war was also a part of the greater [[War of the Grand Alliance]], fought between [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] and his allies, and a European-wide coalition, the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], led by [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire]], supported by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and many other states. The Grand Alliance was a cross-denominational alliance designed to stop French eastward colonialist expansion under Louis XIV, with whom [[James II of England|King James II]] was allied.\n\nThe majority of Irish people were \"Jacobites\" and supported James II due to his 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]] or, as it is also known, The Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Harris|title=Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685\u20131720|location=London|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7139-9759-0|page=440}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A 'Beleaguered Protestant'?: Walter Harris and the Writing of ''Fiction Unmasked'' in Mid-18th-Century Ireland|first=Eoin|last=Magennis|pages=6\u2013111|journal=Eighteenth-Century Ireland|volume=13|year=1998|jstor = 30064327}}</ref> However, James II was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], and the majority of Ulster [[Colonialists]] ([[Williamite]]s) backed [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. It is of note that both the Williamite and Jacobite armies were religiously mixed; William of Orange's own elite forces, the [[Dutch Blue Guards]] had a papal banner with them during the invasion, many of them being Dutch Roman Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rabushka|first=Alvin|year=2008|title=Taxation in Colonial America, 1607\u20131775|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/taxatio_rab_2008_00_1086/page/279 279]|isbn=978-0-691-13345-4|url=https://archive.org/details/taxatio_rab_2008_00_1086/page/279}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the war, Irish Jacobites controlled most of Ireland for James II, with the exception of the Williamite strongholds at [[Derry]] and at [[Enniskillen]] in Ulster. The Jacobites [[Siege of Derry|besieged Derry]] from December 1688 to July 1689, ending when a Williamite army from Britain relieved the city. The Williamites based in Enniskillen defeated another Jacobite army at the [[battle of Newtownbutler]] on 28 July 1689. Thereafter, Ulster remained firmly under Williamite control and William's forces completed their conquest of the rest of Ireland in the next two years. The war provided Protestant [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] with the iconic victories of the [[Siege of Derry]], the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1 July 1690) and the [[Battle of Aughrim]] (12 July 1691), all of which the [[Orange Order]] commemorate each year.\n\nThe Williamites' victory in this war ensured British rule in Ireland for over 200 years. The [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland excluded most of Ulster's population from having any Civil [[power (sociology)|power]] on religious grounds. [[Roman Catholics]] (descended from the indigenous Irish) and [[Presbyterians]] (mainly descended from Scottish colonists) both suffered discrimination under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], which gave full political rights only to [[Anglican]] Protestants (mostly descended from English settlers). In the 1690s, Scottish Presbyterians became a majority in Ulster, due to a large influx of them into the Province.\n\n===Emigration===\nConsiderable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies throughout the 18th century (160,000 settled in what would become the United States between 1717 and 1770 alone).\n\nDisdaining (or forced out of) the heavily English regions on the Atlantic coast, most groups of Ulster-Scots settlers crossed into the \"western mountains,\" where their descendants populated the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] regions and the [[Ohio Valley]]. Here they lived on the frontiers of America, carving their own world out of the wilderness. The Scots-Irish soon became the dominant culture of the Appalachians from [[Pennsylvania]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Author (and US Senator) [[Jim Webb]] puts forth a thesis in his book ''Born Fighting'' to suggest that the character traits he ascribes to the Scots-Irish such as loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and a propensity to bear arms, helped shape the American identity.\n\nIn the [[United States Census, 2000]], 4.3 million Americans claimed Scots-Irish ancestry.  The areas where the most Americans reported themselves in the 2000 Census only as \"American\" with no further qualification (e.g. [[Kentucky]], north-central [[Texas]], and many other areas in the [[Southern US]]) are largely the areas where many Scots-Irish settled, and are in complementary distribution with the areas which most heavily report Scots-Irish ancestry.\n\nAccording to the Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, 400,000 people in the US were of Irish birth or ancestry in 1790 when the first US Census counted 3,100,000 white Americans.  According to the encyclopaedia, half of these Irish Americans were descended from Ulster, and half from the other three provinces of Ireland.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Republicanism, rebellion and communal strife===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nMost of the 18th century saw a calming of sectarian tensions in Ulster. The economy of the province improved, as small producers exported linen and other goods. Belfast developed from a village into a bustling provincial town. However, this did not stop many thousands of Ulster people from emigrating to [[British North America]] in this period, where they became known as \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scots Irish]]\" or \"[[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]\".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPolitical tensions resurfaced, albeit in a new form, towards the end of the 18th century. In the 1790s many Roman Catholics and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], in opposition to [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican domination]] and inspired by the American and French [[revolutions]] joined together in the [[United Irishmen]] movement. This group (founded in Belfast) dedicated itself to founding a non-[[sectarian]] and independent Irish republic. The United Irishmen had particular strength in [[Belfast]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]] and [[County Down|Down]]. Paradoxically however, this period also saw much sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and Protestants, principally members of the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglicans, who practised the British state religion and had rights denied to both Presbyterians and Roman Catholics), notably the \"[[Battle of the Diamond]]\" in 1795, a faction fight between the rival \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\" (Roman Catholic) and \"[[Peep O'Day Boys]]\" (Anglican), which led to over 100 deaths and to the founding of the [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]. This event, and many others like it, came about with the relaxation of the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] and Roman Catholics began to be allowed to purchase land and involve themselves in the linen trade (activities which previously had involved many onerous restrictions). Protestants, including some Presbyterians, who in some parts of the province had come to identify with the Roman Catholic community, used violence to intimidate Roman Catholics who tried to enter the linen trade. Estimates suggest that up to 7000 Roman Catholics suffered expulsion from Ulster during this violence. Many of them settled in northern [[Connacht]]. These refugees' linguistic influence still survives in the dialects of Irish spoken in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which have many similarities to [[Ulster Irish]] not found elsewhere in Connacht. Loyalist militias, primarily [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], also used violence against the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] and against Roman Catholic and Protestant [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] throughout the province.\n\nIn 1798 the United Irishmen, led by [[Henry Joy McCracken]], launched a rebellion in Ulster, mostly supported by Presbyterians. But the British authorities swiftly put down the rebellion and employed severe repression after the fighting had ended. In the wake of the failure of this [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]], and following the gradual abolition of official religious discrimination after the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1800, [[Presbyterians]] came to identify more with the State and with their Anglican neighbours, due to their civil rights now being respected by both the state and their Anglican neighbours.\n\nThe [[1859 Ulster Revival]] was a major [[Christian revival]] that spread throughout Ulster.\n\n===Industrialisation, Home Rule and partition===\n[[File:Royal Avenue Belfast2.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Avenue, [[Belfast]]. [[Photochrom]] print circa 1890\u20131900.]]\nIn the 19th century, Ulster had the only large-scale industrialisation and became the most prosperous province on the island.  In the latter part of the century, [[Belfast]] briefly overtook [[Dublin]] as the island's largest city. Belfast became famous in this period for its huge [[dockyard]]s and [[shipbuilding]] \u2014 and notably for the construction of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. [[Sectarian]] divisions in Ulster became hardened into the political categories of ''[[unionist (Ireland)|unionist]]'' (supporters of the Union with Britain; mostly, but not exclusively, Protestant) and ''[[Irish nationalist|nationalist]]'' (advocates of repeal of the 1800 Act of Union, usually, though not exclusively, Roman Catholic). Northern Ireland's current politics originate from these late 19th century disputes over [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule]] that would have devolved some powers of government to Ireland, and which Ulster Protestants usually opposed\u2014fearing for their religious rights calling it \"Rome Rule\" in an autonomous Roman Catholic-dominated Ireland and also not trusting politicians from the agrarian south and west to support the more industrial economy of Ulster. This lack of trust, however, was largely unfounded as during the 19th and early 20th century important industries in the southern most region of Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and like Belfast, shipbuilding.<ref>https://www.scribd.com/doc/32717516/1919-Cork-Its-Trade-and-Commerce| pg 168</ref>\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|230px|right|The results of the [[1918 Irish general election]], in which [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] won the majority of votes on the island of Ireland, shown in the color green and light green respectively, with the exception being primarily in the East of the province of Ulster.]]\nThousands of unionists, led by the Dublin-born barrister [[Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], signed the \"[[Ulster Covenant]]\" of 1912 pledging to resist Home Rule. This movement also set up the [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF). In April 1914, the UVF assisted with the landing of 30,000 [[Imperial Germany|German]] rifles with 3,000,000 rounds at [[Larne]] by blockading authorities.  (See [[Larne gunrunning]]). The [[Curragh Incident]] showed it would be difficult to use the British army to enforce home rule from Dublin on Ulster's unionist minority.\n\nIn response, Irish republicans created the [[Irish Volunteers]], part of which became the forerunner of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) \u2014 to seek to ensure the passing of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Home Rule Bill]]. Upon the outbreak of [[Ireland and World War I|World War I]] in 1914, 200,000 Irishmen, both Southern and Northern, of all religious sects volunteered to serve in the [[British Army]]. This had the effect of interrupting the armed stand-off in Ireland. As the war progressed, in Ireland, opposition to the War grew stronger, reaching its peak in 1918 when the British government proposed laws to extend [[conscription]] to all able bodied Irishmen during the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|Conscription Crisis]].\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the political party [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] (\"Ourselves\") won the majority of votes in the [[1918 Irish general election]], this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the [[Sinn F\u00e9in Manifesto 1918|Sinn F\u00e9in campaign Manifesto of 1918]], a great deal more than the devolved government/[[Home Rule]] advocated by the (I.P.P) [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. Following the Sinn F\u00e9in victory in these elections the [[Irish Declaration of Independence]] was penned and [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republicans]] launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the [[Irish War of Independence]] (January 1919 \u2013 July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally took the form of street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, with the exception of the south [[County Armagh|Armagh]] area, where [[Frank Aiken]] led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in [[County Donegal]] and the City of [[Derry]], where one of the main Republican leaders was [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. Hugh O'Doherty, a [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the [[First D\u00e1il]], which was elected in late 1918, Prof. [[Eoin Mac N\u00e9ill]] served as the Sinn F\u00e9in T.D. for [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]].\n\n===1920 to present===\n{{main|History of Northern Ireland}}\n{{see also|Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland|Politics of the Republic of Ireland}}\n[[Partition of Ireland]], first mooted in 1912, was introduced with the enactment of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], which gave a form of \"Home rule\" self-government to two areas, [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]], with its capital at [[Dublin]], and \"[[Northern Ireland]]\", consisting of six of Ulster's central and eastern counties, both within a continuing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Dissatisfaction with this led to the [[Irish War of Independence]], which formally ceased on 11 July 1921. Low-level violence, however, continued in Ulster, causing [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] in the south to order a boycott of Northern products in protest at attacks on the Nationalist community there. The Partition was effectively confirmed by the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 6 December 1921. One of the primary stipulations of the treaty was the transformation of Ireland into a self-governing British [[dominion]] called the [[Irish Free State]] (which later became the sovereign [[Republic of Ireland]]), but with the option of a continuation of the home rule institution of Northern Ireland, still within the United Kingdom, if the Northern Ireland Parliament (already in existence) chose to opt out of the Irish Free State. All parties knew that this was certain to be the choice of the Ulster Unionists who had a majority in the parliament, and immediately on the creation of the Free State they resolved to leave it.\n\nFollowing the Anglo Irish treaty, the exact border between the new dominion of the Irish Free State and the future [[Northern Ireland]], if it chose to opt out, was to be decided by the [[Irish Boundary Commission]]. This did not announce its findings until 1925, when the line was again drawn around six of Ulster's nine counties, with no change from the partition of 1920.\n\nElectorally, voting in the six [[Northern Ireland]] counties of Ulster tends to follow religious or sectarian lines; noticeable religious demarcation does not exist in the South Ulster counties of Cavan and Monaghan in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. County Donegal is largely a Roman Catholic county, but with a large [[Protestant]] minority. Generally, Protestants in Donegal vote for the political party [[Fine Gael]] (\"Family of the Irish\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ladlass.com/intel/archives/006991.html |title=The Future's Bright For Donegal's Orangemen |accessdate=6 June 2008 |publisher=Independent News And Media |date=11 July 2004 }}</ref> However, religious sectarianism in politics has largely disappeared from the rest of the Republic of Ireland. This was illustrated when [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine H. Childers]], a [[Church of Ireland]] member and [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD, a member of the lower house of the National Parliament) who had represented Monaghan, won election as [[President of Ireland|President]] after having served as a long-term minister under [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] and [[Jack Lynch]].\n\nThe [[Orange Order]] freely organises in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, with several Orange parades taking place throughout County Donegal each year. The only major Orange Order march in the [[Republic of Ireland]] takes place every July in the village of [[Rossnowlagh]], near [[Ballyshannon]], in the south of County Donegal.\n\n{{As of|2017}}, Northern Ireland has seven Roman Catholic members of parliament, all members of Sinn F\u00e9in (of a total of 18 from the whole of Northern Ireland) in the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]; and the other three counties have one Protestant T.D. of the ten it has elected to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the Lower House of the Oireachtas, the parliament of the Republic of Ireland. At present (August 2007) County Donegal sends six T.D.'s to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The county is divided into two constituencies: Donegal North-East and Donegal South-West, each with three T.D.'s. County Cavan and County Monaghan form the one constituency called Cavan-Monaghan, which sends five T.D.'s to the D\u00e1il (one of whom is a Protestant).\n\nThe historic [[Flag of Ulster]] served as the basis for the [[Ulster Banner]] (often referred to as the Flag of Northern Ireland), which was the flag of the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]] until the proroguing of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament in 1973.\n\n==Wildlife==\n\nWilliam Sherard (1659\u20131728) was the first biologist in Ulster.<ref>Deane, C.D. 1983.

In football, the main competitions in which they compete with the other Irish counties are the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], while the Ulster club champions represent the province in the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]]. Hurling teams play in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], [[National Hurling League]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]. The whole province fields a team to play the other provinces in the [[Railway Cup]] in both football and hurling. Gaelic Football is by far the most popular of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports in Ulster but hurling is also played, especially in [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]], [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]], [[Derry GAA|Derry]], and [[Down GAA|Down]].\n\nThe border has divided association football teams since 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=47|title=Football Association of Ireland|website=www.fai.ie}}</ref> The [[Irish Football Association]] (the I.F.A.) oversees the sport in N.I., while the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (the F.A.I.) oversees the sport in the Republic. As a result, separate international teams are fielded and separate championships take place ([[Irish Football League]] in Northern Ireland, [[League of Ireland]] in the rest of Ulster and Ireland). Anomalously, [[Derry City F.C.]] has played in the League of Ireland since 1985 due to crowd trouble at some of their Irish League matches prior to this. The other major Ulster team in the League of Ireland is [[Finn Harps]] of [[Ballybofey]], County Donegal. When Derry City F.C. and Finn Harps play against each other, the game is usually referred to as a 'North-West Derby'. There have been cup competitions between I.F.A. and F.A.I. clubs, most recently the [[Setanta Sports Cup]].\n\nIn [[Rugby union]], the professional rugby team representing the province and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union|IRFU]] Ulster Branch, [[Ulster Rugby]], compete in the [[Pro14]] along with teams from [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], Italy, South Africa and the other Irish Provinces ([[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] and [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]]). They also compete in Europe's main club rugby tournament, the European Rugby Champions Cup, which they won (as the Heineken Cup) back in 1999. Notable Ulster rugby players include Willy John McBride, [[Jack Kyle]] and [[Mike Gibson (rugby union)|Mike Gibson]]. The former is the most capped [[British and Irish Lions|British and Irish Lion]] of all time, having completed four tours with the Lions in the sixties and seventies. At international level players from Ulster join with those from the other 3 provinces to form the Irish national team. They do not sing the Irish national anthem but do sing a special song which has been written celebrating the \"4 proud provinces\" before matches start.\n\nThe [[Ulster Hockey Union]] organises [[field hockey]] in the province and contributes substantially to the all-island hockey team.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/50209912 | title = Ireland hockey: Seven Ulster players in squad for Olympic qualifier against Canada | work = BBC Sport | date = 28 October 2019 | accessdate = 28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket]] is also played in Ulster, especially in Northern Ireland and East Donegal.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RPtXDMarWTEC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=cricket+belfast+protestant|title=Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images|first1=John|last1=McGarry|first2=Brendan|last2=O'Leary|date=8 June 1995|publisher=Wiley|via=Google Books|isbn=9780631183495}}</ref> Ulster enters two teams into the [[Cricket in Ireland#Inter-Provincial Series|Interprovincial Series]]; the [[Northern Knights (cricket team)|North Knights]] and the [[North West Warriors]], who are the respective representative teams of the [[Northern Cricket Union]] (NCU) and the [[North West Cricket Union]] (NWCU).\n\nGolf is, however, by far the most high-profile sport and the sport that Ulster has succeeded at more than any other.

She had one older brother, Barry Harper, who lived in Ohio and a younger brother, Jeffrey. Her father was a school teacher before he joined the military in 1940. They relocated to the RCAF base at Clinton in July, 1957. Lynne spent time going to Sunday School, Bible class and Girl Guides.\n\nOn June 9, 1959, Lynne&nbsp;\u2013 then 12 years of age&nbsp;\u2013 disappeared near [[RCAF Station Clinton]], an air force base south of [[Clinton, Ontario]] in what is now [[Vanastra, Ontario|Vanastra]] (roughly 80 kilometers north of [[London, Ontario|London]]). Two days later, on the afternoon of June 11, searchers discovered her body in a nearby farm woodlot. Harper had been [[rape]]d and [[strangling|strangled]] with her own blouse.\n\nSteven Truscott and Harper had been classmates in a combined grades 7/8 class at the Air Vice Marshal Hugh Campbell School located on the north side of the Air Force base. In the early evening of Tuesday, June 9, 1959, Truscott had given Harper a ride on the crossbar of his bicycle and proceeded from the vicinity of the school northwards along the County Road. The timing and duration of their encounter, and what happened while they were together, have been contentious issues since 1959.\n\nIn court, the [[Crown attorney|Crown]] contended that Truscott and Harper left the County Road before reaching the bridge over the [[Bayfield River]] and, in a wooded area beside the County Road (known as Lawson's Bush), Truscott raped and murdered Lynne. Truscott has maintained since 1959 that he took Harper to the intersection of the County Road and Highway 8, where he left her unharmed. Truscott maintains that when he arrived at the bridge, he looked back toward the intersection where he had dropped Harper off and observed that a vehicle had stopped and that she was in the process of entering it. On June 10, 1959 at 9:30&nbsp;a.m. Steven was interviewed by (Constable) Hobbs in a cruiser at his school. He told Hobbs that while standing on the bridge, he saw Lynne get into a \"late model Chevrolet\" and there \"was a lot of chrome on the car and it could have been a Bellair [''sic''] version.\"<ref>Kaufman</ref> At 11:20 that evening, Lynne's father reported her missing.<ref name=\"kaufman\">{{cite web\n |title       = Kaufman Report: Executive Summary\n |work        = Fred Kaufman\n |publisher   = Canadian Department of Justice\n |year        = 2004\n |url         = http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/ccr/kaufman/index.html\n |access-date  = 2007-06-04\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070401120657/http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/ccr/kaufman/index.html\n |archive-date = 2007-04-01\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n==Arrest and trial==\nOn June 12, shortly after 7:00&nbsp;p.m., Truscott was taken into custody. At about 2:30&nbsp;a.m. on June 13, he was charged with [[Murder#Degrees of murder|first-degree murder]] under the provisions of the [[Juvenile Delinquents Act]]. On June 30, Truscott was ordered to be [[Trial as an adult|tried as an adult]]; an appeal on that order was dismissed.\n\nOn September 16, Truscott's trial began in the then [[Supreme Court of Ontario]] in [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]] before Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury. Steven Truscott was represented by Frank Donnelly; Glen Hays appeared for the Crown. All the evidence presented in court against the accused was circumstantial, and centred on placing Harper's death within a narrow time frame which implicated Truscott. Key to this narrow window was the autopsy doctor's testimony that the decomposition of Lynne's body and the state of partially digested food in her stomach indicated she had died near the precise time she was acknowledged to have been with Truscott. On September 30, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. Justice Ferguson then sentenced Truscott to death by hanging.\n\nOn January 21, 1960, Truscott's appeal, put forth by John G. J. O'Driscoll to the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] was dismissed. Immediately afterwards the [[Government of Canada]] commuted Truscott's sentence to [[life imprisonment]]. An application for leave to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] was denied on February 24. On that date, Truscott did not have an automatic right to appeal to this court.<ref name=\"kaufman\"/>\n\n==Incarceration and parole==\nFrom his arrest until the commutation of his death sentence, Truscott was imprisoned at the [[Huron Historic Gaol|Huron County Jail]] in Goderich.\n\nAfter the commutation of his sentence he was transferred to the [[Kingston Penitentiary]] for assessment and he was incarcerated at the Ontario Training School for Boys in Guelph from February 1960 to January 1963. On January 14, 1963, he was transferred to [[Collins Bay, Ontario|Collins Bay]] Penitentiary.\n\nTruscott was transferred on May 7, 1967 to the Farm Annex of Collins Bay Penitentiary. On October 21, 1969, Truscott was released on parole and lived in Kingston with his parole officer and then in Vancouver for a brief period before settling in [[Guelph]] under an assumed name. He married and raised three children.\n\nOn November 12, 1974, Truscott was relieved of the terms and conditions of his parole by the [[National Parole Board (Canada)|National Parole Board]].<ref name=\"kaufman\"/>\n\n== At the Supreme Court: the 1960s ==\nTruscott's case was the focus of considerable public attention. In early 1966, [[Isabel LeBourdais]] argued in ''[[The Trial of Steven Truscott]]'' that Truscott had been convicted of a crime he did not commit, rekindling public debate and interest in the case. On April 26, 1966, the Government of Canada referred the Truscott case to the Supreme Court of Canada. Five days of evidence were heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in October 1966, followed by submissions in January 1967. That evidence included the testimony of Truscott, who had not testified at the 1959 trial. British pathologist Professor [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] was invited by the Canadian government to review the forensic evidence.<ref>{{cite book |title= Forty Years of Murder: An Autobiography|last= Simpson|first= Keith|authorlink= Keith Simpson (pathologist)|year= 1978|publisher= Harrap|location= London|isbn= 0-245-53198-X|page= |url=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 4, 1967, the Supreme Court ([[Emmett Matthew Hall|Hall J.]] dissenting) held that, if Truscott's appeal had been heard by the court, it would have been dismissed.<ref name=\"kaufman\"/>\n\n1967, May 4: New forensic evidence was presented on his behalf, and Truscott testified before the Supreme Court of Canada, telling his story for the first time. Truscott and 25 other witnesses testified before the Court. After a two-week hearing before the Supreme Court, Canada\u2019s top judges ruled 8-1 against Truscott getting a new trial, and he was returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Supreme Court stated that \u201cThere were many incredibilities inherent in the evidence given by Truscott before us and we do not believe his testimony.\u201d\n\nThe joint opinion of Canada\u2019s Supreme Court Justices was: \n\u201cThe verdict of the jury, read in the light of the charge of the trial judge, makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of Truscott but were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that Steven Truscott was the guilty person.\u201d <ref>Judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada Re: Steven Murray Truscott, [1967] S.C.R. 309 Date: 1967-05-04</ref>\n\n== At the Ontario Court of Appeal: 2001&ndash;2007 ==\n{{Wikinews|Canadian court clears Stephen Truscott of 1959 murder}}\nTruscott maintained a low profile until 2000, when an interview on [[CBC Television]]'s investigative news program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]'' revived interest in his case. Together with a subsequent book by journalist [[Julian Sher]], they suggested that evidence in favour of Truscott's innocence had been ignored in the original trial.\n\nOn November 28, 2001, [[James Lockyer]] led the [[Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted]] to file an appeal to have the case reopened. On January 24, 2002, retired [[Quebec]] Justice [[Fred Kaufman]] was appointed by the government to review the case. On October 28, 2004, Justice Minister [[Irwin Cotler]] directed a Reference pursuant to section 693.3(a)(ii) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] to the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] to review whether new evidence would have changed the 1959 verdict.\n\nOn April 6, 2006, the body of Lynne Harper was exhumed by order of the [[Attorney General of Ontario]], in order to test for [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]]. There was hope that this would bring some closure to the case, but no usable DNA was recovered from the remains.\n\n[[Calliphoridae|Blow flies]], [[maggot]]s and insect activity on Harper's body were capable of raising a \"reasonable doubt\" whether she died before 8&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 and could suggest she died as late as the next day, although the court said there was no realistic possibility that [[entomology]] could have assisted in solving the murder in 1959. However, samples of insects and maggots were collected from the body at the time, and the science has since evolved. By knowing when insects deposit their eggs or larvae on a corpse, experts can estimate time of death. The evidence did not rule out that Lynne died at the time stated by the Crown.<ref name=\"cbc\"/>\n\nDuring the trial Justice [[Michael Moldaver]] asked retired OPP officer Harry \"Hank\" Sayeau (who assisted Inspector Harold Graham) why the police never considered a sexual psychopath might be responsible for Lynne's rape and murder before they narrowed their focus on a fourteen-year-old: \"Did the thought ever cross your mind that, for someone to strangle her then sexually assault her, you might want to be looking for someone who is more of a pervert, more of a sexual psychopath?\" \"I don't recall that\", said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.<ref>Julian Sher, Until You Are Dead.</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/250919\n|title=Truscott acquittal weighed\n|publisher=The Star\n|date=August 29, 2007\n| location=Toronto\n| first=Tracey\n| last=Tyler}}</ref>\n\nTruscott's conviction was brought to the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] on June 19, 2006. The five-judge panel, headed by Ontario Chief Justice [[Roy McMurtry]] and including Justice Michael Moldaver, heard three weeks of testimony and fresh evidence. On January 31, 2007, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] began hearing arguments from Truscott's defence in the appeal of Truscott's conviction. Arguments were heard by the court over a period of ten days, concluding February 10. In addition to the notoriety of the case itself, the hearing is also notable for being the first time that cameras were allowed into a hearing of the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]].<ref name=\"kaufman\"/>\n\nThe Court of Appeal heard evidence, including earlier versions of draft autopsy reports, that contradicted the supposed narrow window for Lynne's time of death. Pathologist Dr. John Penistan had in fact provided three different estimates for this time period, the first two of which would have excluded Truscott as a suspect. Only after the police had narrowed on Truscott as the prime suspect did Penistan provide \"forensic proof\" that Lynne had died exactly around the time that implicated Truscott. His original estimates and draft autopsy reports were concealed from the defence and the court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/01/29/can_science_clear_truscott.html|title=Can science clear Truscott?|date=Jan 29, 2007|website=thestar.com|accessdate=Mar 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn August 28, 2007, Truscott was acquitted of the charges. Truscott's defence team had originally asked for a declaration of [[factual innocence]], which would mean that Truscott would be declared innocent, and not merely unable to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although they issued the acquittal, the court said it was not in a position to declare Truscott innocent of the crime. \"The appellant has not demonstrated his factual innocence,\" the court wrote. \"At this time, and on the totality of the record, we are in no position to make a declaration of innocence.\" Within the Court's 2006 judgement, as they reviewed the evidence against Truscott, the Court wrote that \"In these circumstances, we cannot say that an acquittal is the only reasonable verdict.\"  Truscott therefore remains a suspect in the killing of Lynne Harper.<ref name=\"ruling\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontariocourts.ca/decisions/2007/august/2007ONCA0575.htm|title=Truscott (Re), 2007 ONCA 575|website=www.ontariocourts.ca|accessdate=Mar 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Court acquits Steven Truscott in 1959 murder\n |publisher   = CTV\n |date        = August 2007\n |url         = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070827/truscott_case_070828/20070828?hub=TopStories\n |format      = \n |access-date  = 2007-08-28\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830125441/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070827/truscott_case_070828/20070828?hub=TopStories\n |archive-date = 2007-08-30\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nAttorney General of Ontario [[Michael Bryant (politician)|Michael Bryant]] apologized to Truscott on behalf of the provincial government, stating they were \"truly sorry\" for the miscarriage of justice.<ref>[[CBC.ca]], [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/court-acquits-truscott-calling-conviction-miscarriage-of-justice-1.668524 Court acquits Truscott, calling conviction 'miscarriage of justice'], August 28, 2008</ref>\n\nMany including Harper's family have never thought that Truscott was innocent of the murder, and in July 2008 Harper's brother described Truscott's compensation package as \"a real travesty\" and indicated he would not inform their father for fear the news would upset him.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/victim-s-family-stunned-by-truscott-compensation-1.747261\n|title=Victim's family stunned by Truscott compensation\n|publisher=CBC News\n|date=July 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural aspects==\nThe 1975 film, directed by Murray Markowitz, called ''[[Recommendation for Mercy]]'', was based fully on the Truscott case,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2014/12/11/a_chilly_look_at_life_in_antarctica_and_some_warm_holiday_classics.html|title=A chilly look at life in Antarctica and some warm holiday classics|date=Dec 11, 2014|website=thestar.com|accessdate=Mar 29, 2020}}</ref> though different names were introduced into the plot.

British pathologist Professor [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] was invited by the Canadian government to review the forensic evidence.<ref>{{cite book |title= Forty Years of Murder: An Autobiography|last= Simpson|first= Keith|authorlink= Keith Simpson (pathologist)|year= 1978|publisher= Harrap|location= London|isbn= 0-245-53198-X|page= |url=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 4, 1967, the Supreme Court ([[Emmett Matthew Hall|Hall J.]] dissenting) held that, if Truscott's appeal had been heard by the court, it would have been dismissed.<ref name=\"kaufman\"/>\n\n1967, May 4: New forensic evidence was presented on his behalf, and Truscott testified before the Supreme Court of Canada, telling his story for the first time. Truscott and 25 other witnesses testified before the Court. After a two-week hearing before the Supreme Court, Canada\u2019s top judges ruled 8-1 against Truscott getting a new trial, and he was returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. The Supreme Court stated that \u201cThere were many incredibilities inherent in the evidence given by Truscott before us and we do not believe his testimony.\u201d\n\nThe joint opinion of Canada\u2019s Supreme Court Justices was: \n\u201cThe verdict of the jury, read in the light of the charge of the trial judge, makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of Truscott but were inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that Steven Truscott was the guilty person.\u201d <ref>Judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada Re: Steven Murray Truscott, [1967] S.C.R. 309 Date: 1967-05-04</ref>\n\n== At the Ontario Court of Appeal: 2001&ndash;2007 ==\n{{Wikinews|Canadian court clears Stephen Truscott of 1959 murder}}\nTruscott maintained a low profile until 2000, when an interview on [[CBC Television]]'s investigative news program ''[[The Fifth Estate (TV)|The Fifth Estate]]'' revived interest in his case. Together with a subsequent book by journalist [[Julian Sher]], they suggested that evidence in favour of Truscott's innocence had been ignored in the original trial.\n\nOn November 28, 2001, [[James Lockyer]] led the [[Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted]] to file an appeal to have the case reopened. On January 24, 2002, retired [[Quebec]] Justice [[Fred Kaufman]] was appointed by the government to review the case. On October 28, 2004, Justice Minister [[Irwin Cotler]] directed a Reference pursuant to section 693.3(a)(ii) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] to the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] to review whether new evidence would have changed the 1959 verdict.\n\nOn April 6, 2006, the body of Lynne Harper was exhumed by order of the [[Attorney General of Ontario]], in order to test for [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]]. There was hope that this would bring some closure to the case, but no usable DNA was recovered from the remains.\n\n[[Calliphoridae|Blow flies]], [[maggot]]s and insect activity on Harper's body were capable of raising a \"reasonable doubt\" whether she died before 8&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 and could suggest she died as late as the next day, although the court said there was no realistic possibility that [[entomology]] could have assisted in solving the murder in 1959. However, samples of insects and maggots were collected from the body at the time, and the science has since evolved. By knowing when insects deposit their eggs or larvae on a corpse, experts can estimate time of death. The evidence did not rule out that Lynne died at the time stated by the Crown.<ref name=\"cbc\"/>\n\nDuring the trial Justice [[Michael Moldaver]] asked retired OPP officer Harry \"Hank\" Sayeau (who assisted Inspector Harold Graham) why the police never considered a sexual psychopath might be responsible for Lynne's rape and murder before they narrowed their focus on a fourteen-year-old: \"Did the thought ever cross your mind that, for someone to strangle her then sexually assault her, you might want to be looking for someone who is more of a pervert, more of a sexual psychopath?\" \"I don't recall that\", said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.<ref>Julian Sher, Until You Are Dead.</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/250919\n|title=Truscott acquittal weighed\n|publisher=The Star\n|date=August 29, 2007\n| location=Toronto\n| first=Tracey\n| last=Tyler}}</ref>\n\nTruscott's conviction was brought to the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] on June 19, 2006. The five-judge panel, headed by Ontario Chief Justice [[Roy McMurtry]] and including Justice Michael Moldaver, heard three weeks of testimony and fresh evidence. On January 31, 2007, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] began hearing arguments from Truscott's defence in the appeal of Truscott's conviction. Arguments were heard by the court over a period of ten days, concluding February 10. In addition to the notoriety of the case itself, the hearing is also notable for being the first time that cameras were allowed into a hearing of the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]].<ref name=\"kaufman\"/>\n\nThe Court of Appeal heard evidence, including earlier versions of draft autopsy reports, that contradicted the supposed narrow window for Lynne's time of death. Pathologist Dr. John Penistan had in fact provided three different estimates for this time period, the first two of which would have excluded Truscott as a suspect. Only after the police had narrowed on Truscott as the prime suspect did Penistan provide \"forensic proof\" that Lynne had died exactly around the time that implicated Truscott. His original estimates and draft autopsy reports were concealed from the defence and the court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/01/29/can_science_clear_truscott.html|title=Can science clear Truscott?|date=Jan 29, 2007|website=thestar.com|accessdate=Mar 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn August 28, 2007, Truscott was acquitted of the charges. Truscott's defence team had originally asked for a declaration of [[factual innocence]], which would mean that Truscott would be declared innocent, and not merely unable to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Although they issued the acquittal, the court said it was not in a position to declare Truscott innocent of the crime. \"The appellant has not demonstrated his factual innocence,\" the court wrote. \"At this time, and on the totality of the record, we are in no position to make a declaration of innocence.\" Within the Court's 2006 judgement, as they reviewed the evidence against Truscott, the Court wrote that \"In these circumstances, we cannot say that an acquittal is the only reasonable verdict.\"  Truscott therefore remains a suspect in the killing of Lynne Harper.<ref name=\"ruling\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontariocourts.ca/decisions/2007/august/2007ONCA0575.htm|title=Truscott (Re), 2007 ONCA 575|website=www.ontariocourts.ca|accessdate=Mar 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Court acquits Steven Truscott in 1959 murder\n |publisher   = CTV\n |date        = August 2007\n |url         = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070827/truscott_case_070828/20070828?hub=TopStories\n |format      = \n |access-date  = 2007-08-28\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830125441/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070827/truscott_case_070828/20070828?hub=TopStories\n |archive-date = 2007-08-30\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nAttorney General of Ontario [[Michael Bryant (politician)|Michael Bryant]] apologized to Truscott on behalf of the provincial government, stating they were \"truly sorry\" for the miscarriage of justice.<ref>[[CBC.ca]], [http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/court-acquits-truscott-calling-conviction-miscarriage-of-justice-1.668524 Court acquits Truscott, calling conviction 'miscarriage of justice'], August 28, 2008</ref>\n\nMany including Harper's family have never thought that Truscott was innocent of the murder, and in July 2008 Harper's brother described Truscott's compensation package as \"a real travesty\" and indicated he would not inform their father for fear the news would upset him.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/victim-s-family-stunned-by-truscott-compensation-1.747261\n|title=Victim's family stunned by Truscott compensation\n|publisher=CBC News\n|date=July 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural aspects==\nThe 1975 film, directed by Murray Markowitz, called ''[[Recommendation for Mercy]]'', was based fully on the Truscott case,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2014/12/11/a_chilly_look_at_life_in_antarctica_and_some_warm_holiday_classics.html|title=A chilly look at life in Antarctica and some warm holiday classics|date=Dec 11, 2014|website=thestar.com|accessdate=Mar 29, 2020}}</ref> though different names were introduced into the plot.

It is not a \"gospel\" in the sense of an account of the works of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]], but is better understood as a [[homily]]. The text is generally considered by scholars one of the best written texts in the whole Nag Hammadi collection, considering its worth highly as both a great literary work and a gnostic [[exegesis]] on several gospels, canonical and otherwise. The ideas expressed deviate from the views of [[Valentinus_(Gnostic)|Valentivian gnosticism]].<ref name=\"O'Regan2001\">{{cite book|author=Cyril O'Regan|title=Gnostic Return in Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9I14XwryfgC&pg=PA110|date=19 July 2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5021-5|pages=110\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNot all scholars, however, agree that the text is to be considered Gnostic. Paterson Brown has argued forcefully that the three Nag Hammadi Coptic Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth are demonstrably not Gnostic in content, since each explicitly affirms the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Brown argues that Gnosticism considers illusory or evil.{{cn|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe writing is thought to cite or allude to the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and John, as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John and the Book of Revelation. It cites John's Gospel the most often. It is also influenced by Thomas; for instance at one point (22:13-19) it cites John 3:8 alongside Thomas 28.\n\n==Content==\nThe text says that ignorance caused the formation of the world by the [[Aeon_(Gnosticism)|aeon]]s. It then describes [[Jesus]] as having been sent down by God to remove ignorance from humans and the aeons, to perfect them and restore union with the Father and correct the error that was the creation of the world.<ref name=\"MeyerRobinson2010\">{{cite book|author1=Marvin W.

But Error grew angry at this, and nailed Jesus to a cross. It also proceeds to describe how it is knowledge of the father that grants salvation, which constitutes eternal rest, describing ignorance as a nightmare.\n\nHaving next described the parable of the good shepherd, in an esoteric manner, it then describes how feeding the hungry and giving rest to the weary is to be understood as feeding spiritual hunger, and resting the world weary.\n\nThis is followed by a parable about anointing, the meaning of which is obscure, but may be connected with the way in which a sealed amphora meant it was full, a metaphor for knowledge - having the final \"seal\" in the jigsaw and you understand, but without it, the scraps of understanding you have put together can still be easily undone:{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n<blockquote>But those whom he has anointed are the ones who have become perfect. For full jars are the ones that are usually anointed. But when the anointing of one (jar) is dissolved, it is emptied, and the reason for there being a deficiency is the thing by which its ointment goes. For at that time a breath draws it, a thing in the power of that which is with it. But from him who has no deficiency, no seal is removed, nor is anything emptied, but what he lacks, the perfect Father fills again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospeltruth-attridge.html|title=Gospel of Truth|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com}}</ref></blockquote>\nAside from a final description of achieving rest by gnosis, the remainder of the text concerns a treatise on the connection between the relationship between the Son and the Father, and the relationship of a name to its owner. The prime example of this is the phrase it uses that ''the name of the Father is the Son'', which is to be understood in the esoteric manner that the ''Son'' is the ''name'', rather than as meaning that ''Son'' was a name for the ''Father''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nUnlike the canonical gospels, this gospel does not contain an account of Jesus' life or teaching. It does contain insights concerning the resurrected Jesus' 40-day ministry.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis gospel, like some other gnostic texts, can be interpreted as proclaiming predestination.{{cn|date=July 2018}} One section states:\n\n{{quote|Those whose name he knew in advance were called at the end, so that one who has knowledge is the one whose name the Father has uttered.

Layton further noted where the excerpts agree with one another.\n\n\"Fragment G\", which Clement of Alexandria (Stromateis 6.52.3-4) related to \"On Friends\", asserts that there is shared matter between Gnostic Christian material, and material found in \"publicly available books\"; which is the result of \"the law that is written in the [human] heart\". Layton relates this to GTr 19.34 - when Jesus taught, \"in their hearts appeared the living book of the living, which is written in the Father's thought and intellect\". Both rely on a shared concept of pre-existent yet obscured knowledge, which emanated from the Father of the Gnostics.\n\n\"Fragment F\" also comes from the Stromateis, 4.89.1-3. Directed to the Gnostics, it calls the congregation \"children of eternal life\" and hopes that they will \"nullify the world without being yourselves nullified\". Layton relates the former to GTr 43.22 at the end of the work, which emphasises that the Gnostics are the Father's children and will live eternally. Layton relates the latter to GTr 24.20, which proposes to \"nullify the realm of appearance\" and then explains this as the world that lacks the Father.\n\nThe concept that fear and the lack of knowledge are connected is evident;\n\n{{quote|Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he (Jesus) passed before those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection, proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the Father, so that he became the wisdom of those who have received instruction.{{cite quote|date=May 2015}} }}\n\nThere is also the mentioning of an awakening brought about through the acquiring of knowledge, and the dismissal of that which is not real, namely fear. Fear is not real because it does not come from the Father. That which is not light is not from the Father, such as a tree only brings forth one fruit, the Father's only fruit is light.\n\nThe level to which these writings express the power of the \"self\" in the coming of knowledge, and the conflict of the innate perception that the average person is too weak, too full of misconceptions to be able to lift themselves up is addressed. The theme of the Gospels is that Christ saves only those whom the Father gives to him. The average person is not poor in spirit, but haughty, and therefore too weak to save himself without the sacrifice of God on our behalf.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Gospels]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Attridge |first1=Harold W. |authorlink1=Harold W.

For if what they produce is the Gospel of Truth, and is different from those the apostles handed down to us, those who care to can learn how it can be shown from the Scriptures themselves that [then] what is handed down from the apostles is not the Gospel of Truth.<ref>{{cite book |author=Irenaeus |title=[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]] |volume=(3.11.9)}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nOther scholars have argued for a forth century composition for the book we now have.<ref name=\"Tite2009\">{{cite book|author=Philip L.

It is not a \"gospel\" in the sense of an account of the works of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]], but is better understood as a [[homily]]. The text is generally considered by scholars one of the best written texts in the whole Nag Hammadi collection, considering its worth highly as both a great literary work and a gnostic [[exegesis]] on several gospels, canonical and otherwise. The ideas expressed deviate from the views of [[Valentinus_(Gnostic)|Valentivian gnosticism]].<ref name=\"O'Regan2001\">{{cite book|author=Cyril O'Regan|title=Gnostic Return in Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9I14XwryfgC&pg=PA110|date=19 July 2001|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5021-5|pages=110\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNot all scholars, however, agree that the text is to be considered Gnostic. Paterson Brown has argued forcefully that the three Nag Hammadi Coptic Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth are demonstrably not Gnostic in content, since each explicitly affirms the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Brown argues that Gnosticism considers illusory or evil.{{cn|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe writing is thought to cite or allude to the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and John, as well as 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Hebrews, 1 John and the Book of Revelation. It cites John's Gospel the most often. It is also influenced by Thomas; for instance at one point (22:13-19) it cites John 3:8 alongside Thomas 28.\n\n==Content==\nThe text says that ignorance caused the formation of the world by the [[Aeon_(Gnosticism)|aeon]]s. It then describes [[Jesus]] as having been sent down by God to remove ignorance from humans and the aeons, to perfect them and restore union with the Father and correct the error that was the creation of the world.<ref name=\"MeyerRobinson2010\">{{cite book|author1=Marvin W.

But Error grew angry at this, and nailed Jesus to a cross. It also proceeds to describe how it is knowledge of the father that grants salvation, which constitutes eternal rest, describing ignorance as a nightmare.\n\nHaving next described the parable of the good shepherd, in an esoteric manner, it then describes how feeding the hungry and giving rest to the weary is to be understood as feeding spiritual hunger, and resting the world weary.\n\nThis is followed by a parable about anointing, the meaning of which is obscure, but may be connected with the way in which a sealed amphora meant it was full, a metaphor for knowledge - having the final \"seal\" in the jigsaw and you understand, but without it, the scraps of understanding you have put together can still be easily undone:{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n<blockquote>But those whom he has anointed are the ones who have become perfect. For full jars are the ones that are usually anointed. But when the anointing of one (jar) is dissolved, it is emptied, and the reason for there being a deficiency is the thing by which its ointment goes. For at that time a breath draws it, a thing in the power of that which is with it. But from him who has no deficiency, no seal is removed, nor is anything emptied, but what he lacks, the perfect Father fills again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospeltruth-attridge.html|title=Gospel of Truth|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com}}</ref></blockquote>\nAside from a final description of achieving rest by gnosis, the remainder of the text concerns a treatise on the connection between the relationship between the Son and the Father, and the relationship of a name to its owner. The prime example of this is the phrase it uses that ''the name of the Father is the Son'', which is to be understood in the esoteric manner that the ''Son'' is the ''name'', rather than as meaning that ''Son'' was a name for the ''Father''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nUnlike the canonical gospels, this gospel does not contain an account of Jesus' life or teaching. It does contain insights concerning the resurrected Jesus' 40-day ministry.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis gospel, like some other gnostic texts, can be interpreted as proclaiming predestination.{{cn|date=July 2018}} One section states:\n\n{{quote|Those whose name he knew in advance were called at the end, so that one who has knowledge is the one whose name the Father has uttered.

Layton further noted where the excerpts agree with one another.\n\n\"Fragment G\", which Clement of Alexandria (Stromateis 6.52.3-4) related to \"On Friends\", asserts that there is shared matter between Gnostic Christian material, and material found in \"publicly available books\"; which is the result of \"the law that is written in the [human] heart\". Layton relates this to GTr 19.34 - when Jesus taught, \"in their hearts appeared the living book of the living, which is written in the Father's thought and intellect\". Both rely on a shared concept of pre-existent yet obscured knowledge, which emanated from the Father of the Gnostics.\n\n\"Fragment F\" also comes from the Stromateis, 4.89.1-3. Directed to the Gnostics, it calls the congregation \"children of eternal life\" and hopes that they will \"nullify the world without being yourselves nullified\". Layton relates the former to GTr 43.22 at the end of the work, which emphasises that the Gnostics are the Father's children and will live eternally. Layton relates the latter to GTr 24.20, which proposes to \"nullify the realm of appearance\" and then explains this as the world that lacks the Father.\n\nThe concept that fear and the lack of knowledge are connected is evident;\n\n{{quote|Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he (Jesus) passed before those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection, proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the Father, so that he became the wisdom of those who have received instruction.{{cite quote|date=May 2015}} }}\n\nThere is also the mentioning of an awakening brought about through the acquiring of knowledge, and the dismissal of that which is not real, namely fear. Fear is not real because it does not come from the Father. That which is not light is not from the Father, such as a tree only brings forth one fruit, the Father's only fruit is light.\n\nThe level to which these writings express the power of the \"self\" in the coming of knowledge, and the conflict of the innate perception that the average person is too weak, too full of misconceptions to be able to lift themselves up is addressed. The theme of the Gospels is that Christ saves only those whom the Father gives to him. The average person is not poor in spirit, but haughty, and therefore too weak to save himself without the sacrifice of God on our behalf.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Gospels]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{more footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Attridge |first1=Harold W. |authorlink1=Harold W.

with philological study.<ref name=\"Yabu 2014\"/> In the context of this overall approach, one of his major theoretical contributions was the notion of \"sonus grammae\", the phonology that is implied by a script system as analytically as differentiable from the phonology of a language that uses the particular script system at a certain time and place.<ref>Yabu, Shir\u014d \u85ea \u53f8\u90ce

These salts are typical ionic [[halide]]s, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from [[brine]] or [[sea water]]. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from [[Great Salt Lake]] brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the [[Dead Sea]] in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral [[bischofite]], is also extracted (by solution mining) out of ancient seabeds, for example, the [[Zechstein]] seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. [[Anhydrous]] magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.\n\n==Structure, preparation, and general properties==\nMgCl<sub>2</sub> crystallizes in the [[cadmium chloride]] motif, which features octahedral Mg centers. Several hydrates are known with the formula MgCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''x''</sub>, and each loses water at higher temperatures: ''x'' = 12 (\u221216.4&nbsp;\u00b0C), 8 (\u22123.4&nbsp;\u00b0C), 6 (116.7&nbsp;\u00b0C), 4 (181&nbsp;\u00b0C), 2 (about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>Holleman, A.

These salts are typical ionic [[halide]]s, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from [[brine]] or [[sea water]]. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from [[Great Salt Lake]] brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the [[Dead Sea]] in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral [[bischofite]], is also extracted (by solution mining) out of ancient seabeds, for example, the [[Zechstein]] seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. [[Anhydrous]] magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.\n\n==Structure, preparation, and general properties==\nMgCl<sub>2</sub> crystallizes in the [[cadmium chloride]] motif, which features octahedral Mg centers.

Leaves are weakened or killed, which can lead to the death of the tree.<ref name=\"colostate1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07425.html |title=Publications \u2013 ExtensionExtension |publisher=Ext.colostate.edu |accessdate=2017-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924005210/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07425.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Locomotive boiler problem==\nThe presence of dissolved magnesium chloride in the well water ([[Water well#Drilled wells|bore water]]) used in locomotive boilers on the [[Trans-Australian Railway]] caused serious and expensive maintenance problems during the steam era. At no point along its route does the line cross a permanent freshwater watercourse, so bore water had to be relied on. No inexpensive treatment for the highly mineralised water was available, and locomotive boilers were lasting less than a quarter of the time normally expected.<ref>{{cite news |title=Overland Locomotive:Feed Water Problems |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3880541 |accessdate=2014-03-11 |newspaper=The Argus |date=1927-03-21}}</ref> In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total train load was water for the engine.
