Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? Sic.--> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena, the maid, is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

It was reprised by me later in the show while Gertie was scrambling breathlessly into a grey bouffant dress in the quick-change room at the side of the stage.

Quincy Magoo''') is a fictional [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] character created at the [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] animation studio in 1949. Voiced by [[Jim Backus]], Mr. Magoo (who quite frankly reminds me of Ian) is a wealthy, short-statured retiree who gets into a series of comical situations as a result of his extreme [[near-sightedness]], compounded by his stubborn refusal to admit the problem. However, through uncanny streaks of luck, the situation always seems to work itself out for him, leaving him no worse than before.\n\nAffected people (or animals) consequently tend to think that he is a [[lunatic]], rather than just being nearsighted. In later cartoons, he is also an actor, and generally a competent one, except for his visual impairment.\n\n''Magoo'' episodes were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] (the Oscar) three times, and received the award twice, for ''[[When Magoo Flew]]'' (1954) and ''Magoo's Puddle Jumper'' (1956).\n\nIn 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked Mr. Magoo number 29 on its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" list.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|location=158|isbn=0-7624-3007-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nMr. Magoo's first appearance was in the theatrical short cartoon ''The Ragtime Bear'' (1949), scripted by [[Millard Kaufman]]. His creation was a collaborative effort; animation director [[John Hubley]] is said to have partly based the character on his uncle Harry Woodruff,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1225373 Letter from Hubley]. Kaufman claimed in a [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15691299 2007 interview] that the character was based on ''his'' uncle.</ref> and [[W. C. Fields]] was another source of inspiration. In a legend circulating among medievalists, [[Harvard University]] professor [[Francis Peabody Magoun|Francis P. Magoun]] is also said to have been the model for  the character.<ref>[http://johnwalter.blogspot.com/2005_01_01_archive.html According to John P. Walter], the archivist for the [[Walter J. Ong]] archive ([[Saint Louis University]])</ref> However, there is no evidence that artist Hubley knew the scholar.  [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] was reluctant to release the short, but did so, only because it included a bear.  However, audiences quickly realized that the real star was Magoo, one of the few \"human\" cartoon characters ever produced in Hollywood at the time.  The short became a box-office success. Cartoon creators often try to find a name that would match the character. For the simple fact that he squinted all the time, the best they could come up with was Quincy for a first name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Magoo character was originally conceived as a mean-spirited [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-like reactionary whose mumbling would include as much outrageous [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] ranting as the animators could get away with. Hubley, who had created Magoo, handed the series completely over to creative director [[Pete Burness]]. Under Burness, Magoo would win two [[Academy Awards]] for the studio with ''[[When Magoo Flew]]'' (1955) and ''[[Magoo's Puddle Jumper]]'' (1956). Burness scrubbed Magoo of his politicized meanness and left only a few strange unempathic comments that made him appear senile or somewhat mad.  Magoo was frequently accompanied in his on-screen escapades with his nephew Waldo, voiced at various times by [[Jerry Hausner]] or [[Daws Butler]].\n\nIn 1957, the record album ''Magoo in [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]]'' was released.

Because UPA had shut down its animation studio in 1959, the animation for these cartoons was done by [[Jack Kinney|Jack Kinney Productions]] and [[Larry Harmon Pictures]]. The cartoons suffered from varying character designs and choppier animation, due to rushed production schedules. Magoo's nephew Waldo (voiced, as in most of the theatrical cartoons, by Jerry Hausner) was seldom seen with his uncle, now appearing in his own episodes, introduced by a brief phone conversation from Magoo's point of view, which acted as a teaser. The Waldo episodes also featured a slick-talking con man named Presley, and always ended with a return to Magoo saying, \"Oh, that Waldo and Presley. What'll they be up to next? Hee hee hee!\"\n\nMagoo's houseboy Cholly (i.e. \"Charlie\") took up a lot of Waldo's slack. Cholly was an Asian stereotype with huge buck teeth and comically fractured English pronunciation. Despite his stereotyped appearance and voice, he nonetheless usually plays [[Double act|straight man]] to Magoo's shenanigans, rather than being a source of humor on his own. He is the \"sane\" one of the pair. His resourcefulness often saves Magoo from danger.\n\nStill other cartoons featured Tycoon Magoo, voiced by [[Mel Blanc]], and his bumbling assistant Worcestershire.\n\nDuring the UPA television era came ''[[Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol]]'', an abbreviated but largely faithful retelling of [[A Christmas Carol|Charles Dickens' tale]]. It was the first ever animated Christmas special made for television and the first hour-long animated TV special and is considered to be a holiday classic of the 1960s, ranking alongside ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' and  ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite web  | last = Hill  | first = Jim  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =  Scrooge U: Part VI \u2013 Magoo's a musical miser  | work =  | publisher = JimHillMedia.com  | date = November 28, 2006  | url = http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2006/11/28/christmas-carol-vi.aspx  | doi =  | access-date =  2006-12-25}}</ref> The special inspired the production of an animated TV series titled ''[[The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo]]'', which placed Magoo as an actor in other well-known stories.

Quincy Magoo''') is a fictional [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] character created at the [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] animation studio in 1949. Voiced by [[Jim Backus]], Mr. Magoo is a wealthy, short-statured retiree who gets into a series of comical situations as a result of his extreme [[near-sightedness]], compounded by his stubborn refusal to admit the problem. However, through uncanny streaks of luck, the situation always seems to work itself out for him, leaving him no worse than before.\n\nAffected people (or animals) consequently tend to think that he is a [[lunatic]], rather than just being nearsighted. In later cartoons, he is also an actor, and generally a competent one, except for his visual impairment.\n\n''Magoo'' episodes were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] (the Oscar) three times, and received the award twice, for ''[[When Magoo Flew]]'' (1954) and ''Magoo's Puddle Jumper'' (1956).\n\nIn 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked Mr. Magoo number 29 on its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" list.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|location=158|isbn=0-7624-3007-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nMr. Magoo's first appearance was in the theatrical short cartoon ''The Ragtime Bear'' (1949), scripted by [[Millard Kaufman]]. His creation was a collaborative effort; animation director [[John Hubley]] is said to have partly based the character on his uncle Harry Woodruff,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1225373 Letter from Hubley]. Kaufman claimed in a [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15691299 2007 interview] that the character was based on ''his'' uncle.</ref> and [[W. C. Fields]] was another source of inspiration. In a legend circulating among medievalists, [[Harvard University]] professor [[Francis Peabody Magoun|Francis P. Magoun]] is also said to have been the model for  the character.<ref>[http://johnwalter.blogspot.com/2005_01_01_archive.html According to John P. Walter], the archivist for the [[Walter J. Ong]] archive ([[Saint Louis University]])</ref> However, there is no evidence that artist Hubley knew the scholar.  [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] was reluctant to release the short, but did so, only because it included a bear.  However, audiences quickly realized that the real star was Magoo, one of the few \"human\" cartoon characters ever produced in Hollywood at the time.  The short became a box-office success. Cartoon creators often try to find a name that would match the character. For the simple fact that he squinted all the time, the best they could come up with was Quincy for a first name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Magoo character was originally conceived as a mean-spirited [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-like reactionary whose mumbling would include as much outrageous [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] ranting as the animators could get away with. Hubley, who had created Magoo, handed the series completely over to creative director [[Pete Burness]]. Under Burness, Magoo would win two [[Academy Awards]] for the studio with ''[[When Magoo Flew]]'' (1955) and ''[[Magoo's Puddle Jumper]]'' (1956). Burness scrubbed Magoo of his politicized meanness and left only a few strange unempathic comments that made him appear senile or somewhat mad.  Magoo was frequently accompanied in his on-screen escapades with his nephew Waldo, voiced at various times by [[Jerry Hausner]] or [[Daws Butler]].\n\nIn 1957, the record album ''Magoo in [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]]'' was released. Side 1 consisted of a dialog between Magoo and Waldo taking place while Magoo was attempting to set up his new [[Shelf stereo|sound system]].  Music on the album was composed and conducted by [[Dennis Farnon]] and his orchestra.  Side 2, \"The Mother Magoo Suite\", was a series of musical pieces which included two solos by [[Marni Nixon]].\n\nIn 1959, Mr. Magoo starred in ''[[1001 Arabian Nights (1959 film)|1001 Arabian Nights]]'', directed by [[Jack Kinney]], UPA's first feature-length production.<ref name=\"MaltinMiceMagic\">{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |page=341 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the live-action comedy film ''[[Mr. Magoo (film)|Mr. Magoo]]'' was produced by Walt Disney Pictures on December 25, 1997 and starred [[Leslie Nielsen]] as the title character.<ref>{{cite news |title='Mr. Magoo' Blunders Into Live-Action |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/24/entertainment/ca-1654 |access-date=2012-06-03}}</ref> The film received negative reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mr. Magoo (film) |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date= |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971225/REVIEWS/712250303 |access-date=2012-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video]] action-comedy film based on the character, ''[[Kung Fu Magoo]]'', was released on DVD on May 11, 2010.

His resourcefulness often saves Magoo from danger.\n\nStill other cartoons featured Tycoon Magoo, voiced by [[Mel Blanc]], and his bumbling assistant Worcestershire.\n\nDuring the UPA television era came ''[[Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol]]'', an abbreviated but largely faithful retelling of [[A Christmas Carol|Charles Dickens' tale]]. It was the first ever animated Christmas special made for television and the first hour-long animated TV special and is considered to be a holiday classic of the 1960s, ranking alongside ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' and  ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite web  | last = Hill  | first = Jim  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =  Scrooge U: Part VI \u2013 Magoo's a musical miser  | work =  | publisher = JimHillMedia.com  | date = November 28, 2006  | url = http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2006/11/28/christmas-carol-vi.aspx  | doi =  | access-date =  2006-12-25}}</ref> The special inspired the production of an animated TV series titled ''[[The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo]]'', which placed Magoo as an actor in other well-known stories.

It failed to find critical or popular success, and some support groups for the [[Disability|disabled]], including the [[National Federation of the Blind]], protested it on behalf of the blind and sight-impaired.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/24/entertainment/ca-1654|title='Mr. Magoo' Blunders Into Live-Action|last=Anderson|first=John|date=December 24, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=May 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Mexican-U.S. animated feature, ''[[Kung-Fu Magoo]]'', was released as a direct-to-DVD release in 2010 and made its TV debut on Disney XD in 2011.\n\nMr. Magoo helped advertise the [[General Electric]] line of products throughout the 1950s and 1960s,<ref>[http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1062616508 General Electric advertisement featuring Mr. Magoo].

It was named by Choshin Chibana in 1933, but the system itself is much older. The characters \u5c11\u6797, meaning \"small\" and \"forest\" respectively and pronounced \"sh\u014drin\" in Japanese, are also used in the Chinese and Japanese words for \"[[Ryu (martial arts)|Ry\u016b]]\" means \"school\".  Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b combines elements of the traditional Okinawan fighting styles of [[Shuri-te]].<ref name=\"bishop1\"/><ref name=\"ihadojo1\"/><ref name=\"wonder-okinawa1\"/><ref name=\"wonder-okinawa2\"/><ref name=\"shorinryushorinkan1\"/><ref name=\"oshukai1\"/>\n\n==History==\nCh\u014dshin Chibana was a top student of the great master of [[shuri-te]], [[Ank\u014d Itosu]]. Ank\u014d Itosu was the top student of [[Matsumura S\u014dkon]], who was a renowned warrior in his time; bodyguard to three kings of Okinawa, he has been called the [[Miyamoto Musashi]] of Okinawa and was dubbed ''[[Bushi (warrior)|bushi]]'', or warrior, by his king. However, while S\u014dkon is often referred to as the \"founder\" of Shuri-te, he did not invent all of its components. Ch\u014dshin Chibana never practiced kobudo. In 1933, Ch\u014dshin Chibana chose to name his style Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b in honor of its samurai roots and to differentiate it from other styles that were being modified from the original teachings of Ank\u014d Itosu. Generally, Okinawan karate schools did not have individual names for styles like schools in Japan. Several branches of traditional Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b exist today in both Okinawa and the Western World. While there is a more concentrated population of practitioners in its birthplace of Okinawa, Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b Karate has had many high ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' grades outside Okinawa.\n\n== Training ==\nSh\u014drin-ry\u016b is generally characterized by natural breathing, natural (narrow, high) [[Karate stances|stance]]s, and circular, rather than direct movements. Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b practitioners assert that correct motion, moving quickly to evade violence with fluid movements and flexible positions are important, and that a solid structure is vital for powerful blocks and strikes. Stances that are too deep generally make body movement difficult. Another feature in this system is how the student is taught to [[tsuki|punch]]. Generally, there is neither a horizontal nor vertical punch in Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b. Punches are slightly canted to the inside (Isshin Ryu), with the largest knuckle of the fore finger (third from the tip) in vertical alignment with the second knuckle of the pinky finger. It is believed that this position is key in lining up the bones of the arm and creates a faster, more stable and powerful strike.\n\n==Kata==\nSome of the key [[kata]] in Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b are:<ref name=Qbook>{{cite book|last=Cummins|first=William|title=Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b : Okinawan karate question and answer book|year=1984|publisher=Person-to-Person Pub.|location=New York|isbn=9780804814263|edition=1st}}</ref><sup>p.&nbsp;30</sup>\n<br>These are Series not truly thought of as 'Kata'\n*Fugyugata\n*Kihons (Basics)\n**shodan \n**nidan\n**sandan\n**yondan\n**godan\n\n<br>Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b Core Katas\n*Naihanchi Kata\n**shodan\n**nidan\n**sandan\n*Pinan Kata\n**shodan\n**nidan\n**sandan\n**yondan\n**godan\n*Passai\n**sho\n**dai\n*Gojushiho\n*Chinto\n*Kusanku\n**sho\n**dai\n*Gorin\n\nThe following Kata are not taught in all Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b systems or Dojos\n*Seisan\n*Ananku\n*[[Wankan]]\n*Rohai\n*Wanshu\n\nThe study of weapons only starts at dan-level, and weapon kata are not standardised across the style.<ref name=Qbook /><sup>p.&nbsp;45.

The Dan progression continues from 1st Dan (Shodan, or 'beginning dan') to the higher dan grades. Ky\u016b-grade karateka are referred to as \"color belt\" or mudansha (\"ones without dan\"); Dan-grade karateka are referred to as yudansha (holders of dan rank).

It was named by Choshin Chibana in 1933, but the system itself is much older. The characters \u5c11\u6797, meaning \"small\" and \"forest\" respectively and pronounced \"sh\u014drin\" in Japanese, are also used in the Chinese and Japanese words for \"[[Ryu (martial arts)|Ry\u016b]]\" means \"school\".  Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b combines elements of the traditional Okinawan fighting styles of [[Shuri-te]].<ref name=\"bishop1\"/><ref name=\"ihadojo1\"/><ref name=\"wonder-okinawa1\"/><ref name=\"wonder-okinawa2\"/><ref name=\"shorinryushorinkan1\"/><ref name=\"oshukai1\"/>\n\n==History==\nCh\u014dshin Chibana was a top student of the great master of [[shuri-te]], [[Ank\u014d Itosu]]. Ank\u014d Itosu was the top student of [[Matsumura S\u014dkon]], who was a renowned warrior in his time; bodyguard to three kings of Okinawa, he has been called the [[Miyamoto Musashi]] of Okinawa and was dubbed ''[[Bushi (warrior)|bushi]]'', or warrior, by his king. However, while S\u014dkon is often referred to as the \"founder\" of Shuri-te, he did not invent all of its components. Ch\u014dshin Chibana never practiced kobudo. In 1933, Ch\u014dshin Chibana chose to name his style Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b in honor of its samurai roots and to differentiate it from other styles that were being modified from the original teachings of Ank\u014d Itosu. Generally, Okinawan karate schools did not have individual names for styles like schools in Japan. Several branches of traditional Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b exist today in both Okinawa and the Western World. While there is a more concentrated population of practitioners in its birthplace of Okinawa, Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b Karate has had many high ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' grades outside Okinawa.\n\n== Training ==\nSh\u014drin-ry\u016b is generally characterized by natural breathing, natural (narrow, high) [[Karate stances|stance]]s, and circular, rather than direct movements. Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b practitioners assert that correct motion, moving quickly to evade violence with fluid movements and flexible positions are important, and that a solid structure is vital for powerful blocks and strikes. Stances that are too deep generally make body movement difficult. Another feature in this system is how the student is taught to [[tsuki|punch]]. Generally, there is neither a horizontal nor vertical punch in Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b. Punches are slightly canted to the inside (Isshin Ryu), with the largest knuckle of the fore finger (third from the tip) in vertical alignment with the second knuckle of the pinky finger. It is believed that this position is key in lining up the bones of the arm and creates a faster, more stable and powerful strike.\n\n==Kata==\nSome of the key [[kata]] in Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b are:<ref name=Qbook>{{cite book|last=Cummins|first=William|title=Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b : Okinawan karate question and answer book|year=1984|publisher=Person-to-Person Pub.|location=New York|isbn=9780804814263|edition=1st}}</ref><sup>p.&nbsp;30</sup>\n<br>These are Series not truly thought of as 'Kata'\n*Fugyugata\n*Kihons (Basics)\n**shodan \n**nidan\n**sandan\n**yondan\n**godan\n\n<br>Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b Core Katas\n*Naihanchi Kata\n**shodan\n**nidan\n**sandan\n*Pinan Kata\n**shodan\n**nidan\n**sandan\n**yondan\n**godan\n*Passai\n**sho\n**dai\n*Gojushiho\n*Chinto\n*Kusanku\n**sho\n**dai\n*Gorin\n\nThe following Kata are not taught in all Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b systems or Dojos\n*Seisan\n*Ananku\n*[[Wankan]]\n*Rohai\n*Wanshu\n\nThe study of weapons only starts at dan-level, and weapon kata are not standardised across the style.<ref name=Qbook /><sup>p.&nbsp;45.
