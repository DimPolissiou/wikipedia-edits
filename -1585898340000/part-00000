The game was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] in April 2016. The game centers on Jack Joyce, granted time manipulation powers after a failed time-machine experiment, as he comes into conflict with former friend Paul Serene over how to deal with an apocalyptic \"End of Time\". In addition, the game includes [[platform game]] elements in less action-oriented segments. There are also \"junction points\" that affect the game's outcome. The game features episodes of an integrated live-action television show, featuring the actors of the characters. The characters interact with the player's choices, displaying the results of the decisions made.\n\nThe game originally was envisioned as a sequel to Remedy's previous game, ''[[Alan Wake]]''. The game's focus was shifted to time travel, as Microsoft wanted a new [[intellectual property]] with interactive storytelling. The team consulted scientists while creating the fictional science in this game. While the video game portion was developed internally by Remedy and directed by studio veteran [[Sam Lake]], the TV side of the game was developed by Lifeboat Productions and directed by [[Ben Ketai]]. [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aidan Gillen]] and [[Lance Reddick]] portrayed important roles in the game. The game uses a new engine developed by Remedy, the Northlight engine, and a technology called [[Digital Molecular Matter]].\n\nThe game was announced in mid-2013 and was set to release in 2015, but its release was delayed to avoid competition with other Xbox One exclusives. It received a positive reception, with critics praising the game's graphics, gameplay, presentation, and story. Critics had mixed opinions regarding the platforming elements, the convergence of video game and television, and the overall quality of the TV show. The [[Windows 10]] version was criticized for its technical issues. ''Quantum Break'' was the best-selling new intellectual property published by Microsoft since the launch of Xbox One.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Quantum Break gameplay screenshot.jpg |thumb |left |In this screenshot, the [[player character]] is using Time Stop to defeat enemies]]\n\n''Quantum Break'' is an [[action-adventure]] video game played from a [[third-person perspective]].

Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, it is impossible for the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{See also|List of Quantum Break episodes}}\nAgreeing to help his best friend Paul Serene with a demonstration, Jack Joyce learns that Paul has been expanding on the physics work of Jack's estranged brother, William, and has built a time machine that works using \"chronon particles.\" Paul activates the machine, only for it to jam shut and break as William appears. Will demands Jack and Paul stop their actions, else \"time will break.\" The machine becomes unstable and douses Jack and Paul in chronon radiation that gives them time-based powers. Monarch Solutions soldiers appear and steal the time machine's core, Jack and Will meet an older Paul. Claiming to have seen the \"End of Time\", this Paul refuses Will's suggestions of fixing the fracture, claiming time cannot be changed. Paul has the building detonated, causing Will to be seemingly killed by falling debris. Jack is knocked unconscious and captured by Monarch.\n\nEscaping Monarch during a time stutter, Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, students apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch and learns that Paul was accidentally sent to the end of time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.\n\nPaul, revealed to be dying from \"chronon syndrome,\"{{efn|Caused by overexposure to chronon radiation, the illness is detrimental to his health and incurable and requires medical chronon exposure, similarly to real-life [[radiotherapy]]. The disease is implied to be what allows him to see possible futures, unlike Jack.}} lashes out at his second-in-command Martin Hatch, as Amaral was the only one capable of administering his treatment. Now paranoid, Paul places all of his trust in either Amaral or Hatch, who claims that Amaral left willingly with Jack. Paul recognizes Beth from security footage\u2014 she was also at the end of time and attempted to kill Serene.\n\nTaking Amaral to the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Beth force her to help repair the time machine. With Will's documents noting that the CFR disappeared in 2010, Jack and Beth plot to head to 2010 and steal it, closing a [[causal loop]]. Beth steps into the machine as Amaral sabotages the computer and alerts Monarch. Leaving Amaral with Nick/Amy, Jack heads to 2010 and finds Beth, much older and disturbed. Beth explains that Amaral sent her to the end of time, where she met the younger Paul. Failing to kill him, Beth followed him back to the first activation in 1999 and stopped him from murdering Will. After directing Will to create the CFR, she has waited eleven years for Jack to arrive in 2010.\n\nBeth and Jack reach Will's workshop and find the CFR, but Paul corners Beth and shoots her when she refuses to co-operate. The CFR is accidentally activated, causing a chronon burst; the exposure throws Jack forward to 2016 again and causes Paul's chronon syndrome. Beth shuts off the CFR but is executed by Paul while Jack can only watch through time.\n\nIncreasingly paranoid and ill, Paul is informed that, despite his lab being destroyed by Hatch, one damaged treatment has been recovered. Paul either decides to take it and buy time for himself and his plan or succumb to paranoia and illness. As stutters become nearly constant, Jack fights through the Monarch HQ with the guidance of either head of surveillance Charlie Wincott or Wincott's close friend Fiona Miller. Reaching Paul's lab, Jack finds and receives Wincott\u2019s aid or fights high-level Monarch security officer Liam Burke. Acquiring the CFR, Jack learns that Paul was using it to power a \"lifeboat,\" a small bunker where researchers could devise a solution to the end of time while protected from it. Unable to work the CFR, Jack uses Monarch's time machine (equipped with the stolen university core) to travel back to its first activation: the night of Will's death.\n\nRushing through the University, Jack narrowly rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, as it would erase key future events and risk a [[time paradox]]. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to unfreeze her but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to [[jump start (vehicle)|jumpstart]] it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, which in turn restabilises but does not fully repair the damage done to the Meyers-Joyce field and also disintegrates Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self-traveling to the end of time and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.\n\nIn a flash-forward, Jack is shown approaching the frozen Beth back at the University, whispering that he'll come back for her. An epilogue shows Jack leaving an interview and being approached by Hatch,{{efn|Despite Hatch's death being shown in Episode 4, additional collectibles and a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] imply that Hatch is a shifter capable of self-control and living in spaces with time.}} who explains everything has been simply blamed on Paul, and offers Jack a place at the renewed Monarch; Jack is shown seeing a split pathway similarly to Paul, ending before he makes a decision.<ref name=\"VG\">{{cite video game |title=Quantum Break |developer=[[Remedy Entertainment]] |publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]] |date=5 April 2016 |platform=[[Xbox One]] |version=1.0 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cast ===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image1 = Lance Reddick portrait 2009.jpg\n | width1 = 500 | height1 = 700\n | caption1= [[Lance Reddick]] plays Martin Hatch\n\n | image2 = Dominic Monaghan 2009 cropped.jpg\n | width2 = 500 | height2 = 700\n | caption2 = [[Dominic Monaghan]] plays William Joyce\n}}\nThe game's cast of actors was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2015.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 August 2015 |url=http://news.xbox.com/2015/08/gamescom-quantum-break |title=gamescom 2015: Quantum Break Announces an All-star Cast |publisher=Xbox Wire |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Shawn Ashmore]] as Jack Joyce\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Paul Serene, Jack's former best friend, the mastermind behind Monarch Solutions and secondary player character.\n* [[Patrick Heusinger]] as Liam Burke, one of Monarch's lead security staff, central character to the episodes, and recurring game character.\n* [[Marshall Allman]] as Charlie Wincott, Monarch's head of surveillance and central character to the episodes.\n* Courtney Hope as Beth Wilder, a Monarch [[double agent]] whom Will trusts and Jack befriends.\n* [[Mimi Michaels]] as Fiona Miller, a Monarch employee and close friend of Charlie Wincott, and central character to the episodes.\n* [[Brooke Nevin]] as Emily Burke, Liam Burke's pregnant wife and a recurring show character.\n* Jacqueline Pi\u00f1ol as Dr. Sofia Amaral, one of Serene's advisers who acts as his doctor.\n* [[Amelia Rose Blaire]] as Amy Ferrero, the lead protester who, depending on Serene's actions, is either a supporting character or is killed following the first act.\n* Sean Durrie as Nick Marsters, the taxi driver from the introduction.

There are approximately 40 variations in the game TV show, triggered by \"quantum ripples\", which unlock deleted scenes and give players additional insight on the story, and junction points. The player plays part of the game as Paul Serene and makes decisions as him at these points. Inspired by ''[[Die Hard]]'', the writers hoped that this approach would allow them to create a complex villain with depth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/11/22/remedy-s-sam-lake-details-quantum-break-s-transmedia-approach.aspx |title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake Details Quantum Break\u2019s Transmedia Approach |first=Mike |last=Futter |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=22 November 2013| accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> According to Louden, the story characters are not \"black and white\", and depending on the player's perspective, players will feel sympathy for the villain and feel torn when making the choices.

According to Lake, the product was designed to be a complete package, players are encouraged to both play the game and watch the show. While the game allows players to skip the TV show completely, Remedy advise against such behaviors, as players may miss crucial details if they do not watch the show. The game features many collectibles, which serve a narrative purpose. Lake explained that once players find a collectible, they will trigger a [[butterfly effect]], whose consequences will be shown during the show. The show also shows some objects, which can be found in the core game. Through this approach, the team hoped that they could offer an experience that is unique and personalized for all players, and increase the depth of the story.<ref name=\"PolyFeature\"/> Initially, the game and the TV show were to tell drastically different stories featuring a completely different set of characters. However, Lake eventually scrapped the idea, and the game and the show echo each other more closely.<ref name=\"venturebeat\">{{cite web|url= https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/11/remedys-sam-lake-stepped-up-the-creativity-and-ambition-with-microsofts-quantum-break/ |title=How Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake stepped up the ambition and creativity of Quantum Break | first=Dean| last=Takahashi |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=11 April 2016 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> Lake described the TV show as a \"natural progression\" for the studio, having experimented with the format with the two ''Max Payne'' games, which feature televisions, and ''Alan Wake'', which has the ''Bright Falls'' live action show,<ref name=\"NL\"/> and ''[[Alan Wake: American Nightmare]]'', which features live-action cutscenes.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/> Producer Thomas Puha added that the game is \"the culmination of 21 years of work\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.vg247.com/2016/03/04/quantum-break-gameplay/ |title=Quantum Break is \"the culmination of 21 years of work\" |first=Danny |last=Wadeson |work=[[VG247]] |date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> Lake added that the TV part can serve as an entry point for people who do not play video games frequently, and draw them into video gaming.<ref name=\"feature\"/> To keep both parts consistent, the team also consulted a filmmaker who gave them advice regarding the game's camera styles and depth of field to allow smooth transitions between the two mediums.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/12/5991679/quantum-break-remedy-entertainment-cinematic-director |title=A filmmaker is helping to make Quantum Break the most cinematic game Remedy has ever made |first=Emily |last=Gera |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |work= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nLake initially thought Microsoft was not particularly enthusiastic about the idea, but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/remedy-s-quantum-leap-sam-lake-on-the-studio-s-most-ambitious-game-yet/0164881 |title=Remedy's Quantum leap: Sam Lake talks about the studio's most ambitious game yet |first=Alex |last=Calvin |work=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> However, as the TV show was not part of Microsoft's project, the closure of [[Xbox Entertainment Studios]] did not affect the progress of the TV show production.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/18/quantum-break-not-impacted-by-xbox-entertainment-studios-closure/ |title=Quantum Break not impacted by Xbox Entertainment Studios closure| first=Sinan| last=Kubba| work=[[Engadget]]| date=18 July 2014| accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through [[Skype]] conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/>\n\nWith Microsoft's funding, Remedy hired lots of high-profile actors, including [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Lance Reddick]] and [[Dominic Monaghan]]. During the game's announcement and first gameplay reveal at [[Gamescom 2014]], Jack Joyce was portrayed by Sean Durrie. According to Louden, they were creating the animation for Ashmore's character, and did not have sufficient time to finalize them before the event, so they used their game prototype, which has Durrie starring as the lead character, as the game's demo. The change in lead actors also prompted the studio to update and change the game cover art.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/15/quantum-break-gets-box-art-redesign |title=New Quantum Break Box Art Revealed |first=Alex |last=Osborn |work=[[IGN]] |date=15 August 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> Ashmore, Monaghan and Gillen were announced as the game's protagonists and antagonists a year later, and Durrie starred in the game as Nick.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/>\n\n===Design===\nWhile developing the game, Remedy consulted Syksy R\u00e4s\u00e4nen, a scientist who is a lecturer at [[Helsinki University]] and had worked at [[CERN]]. He taught them how to write the plot in such a way that it adhered to current [[theoretical physics]] and [[quantum physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-break-interview-sam-lake|title=How real physics impacted time-travel game Quantum Break|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=30 June 2016|first=Matt|last=Kamen}}</ref> The development team held several brainstorming sessions, which inspired the team and helped them to fix the design of the game's time machine. The team was also inspired, when creating their own fictional \"Meyer-Joyce particle\" and \"Meyer-Joyce field\", by the [[Higgs boson]] and Higgs fields.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/>\n\nAccording to Lake, they experimented with different gameplay mechanics, some of which they judged to make the game too slow or too tactical. They intended to \"recapture the action spectacle\" featured in their ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' series, along with several modern iterations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/09/quantum-break-hands-on-preview-and-interview-we-wanted-to-recapture-the-action-spectacle-we-had-with-max-payne-5741405/ |title=Quantum Break hands-on preview and interview \u2013 \u2018we wanted to recapture the action spectacle we had with Max Payne\u2019 |first=David |last=Jenkins |work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]] |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> The game was designed to be fast-paced, but the concept of time-travel did not accommodate the elements of this kind of gameplay. As a result, the team opted to include a broader theme: time itself. They set the game in a world where time collapses, leading to various dangerous situations. According to Lake, the theme of time connected all the elements featured in the game. The setting also allowed the team to add new gameplay mechanics, such as the time manipulation powers.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/> They created ''Quantum Break'' as a [[third-person shooter]] because of their past experiences with the genre and because they thought that the third-person perspective would allow them to show a strong leading character, while a purely story-oriented game would not feel like a [[AAA (video game industry)|triple A]] title.<ref name=\"GSpot TPS\"/>\n\nLouden says the team put a lot of work into the game's difficulty. They hoped that the time powers would let the player feel like a [[superhero]], while still allowing for challenging moments.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/> Learning from criticism of ''Alan Wake'', they introduced several puzzles in order to increase variety and change the pace.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/quantum-break-interview-pc-release-date-and-new-trailer/ |title=Quantum Break interview, PC release date and new trailer |first=Tom |last=Hoggins |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date= 11 February 2015 |accessdate= 30 June 2016}}</ref> The puzzles also serve to remind players of their arsenal of abilities. Some of the environmental puzzles, including the rewind feature, were inspired by titles like ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'' and ''[[Life Is Strange]]'', while the stutter sequences were inspired by ''[[Salvador Dali (film)|Salvador Dali]]'' and ''Inception'''s dream sequence.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/>\n\nWhen time stutters occur, the game's visual changes to inform players that they will encounter new enemies and obstacles. The levels in the game were designed to feature open environments to allow players to use the time manipulation powers freely and encouraging them to explore. Kyle Rowley, lead designer of the game, described them as \"arenas\". The stutters were also designed to convey stories: Players can inspect the [[non-playable character]]s stuck in a time stutter and learn about what happened to them when time freezes. To prevent the game from relying excessively on its cover system, the [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) of the game was designed to attack the player aggressively in order to drive the player out from cover. Time powers affect AI behaviors, and Remedy built a new system that allows the AI to search for the player character after Time Rush is used.<ref name=\"level design\">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-quantum-breaks-developers-tackled-time-manipul/1100-6436820/ |title=How Quantum Break's Developers Tackled Time Manipulation Combat |first=Justin |last=Haywald |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=3 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nThe game utilizes a new in-house engine called the Northlight Engine.<ref name=\"NL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/quantum_break/b/xboxone/archive/2013/06/21/remedy-s-sam-lake-talks-quantum-break-and-alan-wake-2.aspx|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake Talks Quantum Break And Alan Wake 2|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> To represent the idea of \"broken time\" and have a detailed destruction system, the team created lots of environments which put the player character in the midst of destruction, utilizing technologies ranging from geometric distortion waves to Thinking Particles.<ref name=\"tech\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/time-for-destruction-the-tech-of-quantum-break/|title=Time for destruction: the tech of Quantum Break|first=Ian|last=Failes|work=FX Guide|date=21 April 2016|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> The team also used [[Digital Molecular Matter]], a technology developed by Pixelux that allows structures and objects to react in the game the same way they would in reality. According to Mikko Uromo, the technology allows them to \"simulate complex scenarios on a scale that hasn't been possible before\" and is crucial to the game's development.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/quantum_break/news/quantum_break_gets_advanced_digital_molecular_matter_destruction_tech.html |title=Quantum Break gets advanced 'Digital Molecular Matter' destruction tech |first=David |last=Scammell |work=VideoGamer.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> The team also worked significantly on the game's lighting system. It was designed to be dynamic, and the team refined it to include eyes and hair. They also created a new [[global illumination]] system for indirect lighting.<ref name=\"tech\"/> The game's [[Display resolution|resolution]] foundation was [[720p]], but Remedy attempted to raise it to [[1080p]] by using [[3D reconstruction|temporal reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-breaks-resolution-is-a-complicated-issue-s/1100-6435898/ |title=Quantum Break's Resolution Is a Complicated Issue, Says Dev |first=Tamoor |last=Hussain |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=22 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe team spent a lot of resources in carrying out detailed [[motion capture]], to enhance players' engagement with the story and make it easier for them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances.<ref name=\"feature\">{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4427698/quantum-break-xbox-one |title=Quantum Break Brings Binge Viewing To Video Games |first=Chris |last=Plante |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture is to convince the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records every little detail of their faces.<ref name=\"NL\"/> The team initially did the recording at [[Los Angeles]], where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in [[Helsinki]], where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a \"Sweat Box\", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Ashmore |first=Shawn |subject-link= Shawn Ashmore |interviewer= Matthew Jarvis |title=Quantum Break actor details Remedy's 'Sweat Box' method for photorealistic facial capture |url= http://www.develop-online.net/news/quantum-break-actor-details-remedy-s-sweat-box-method-for-photorealistic-facial-capture/0219650 |date= 26 April 2016 |access-date=30 June 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160427114012/http://www.develop-online.net/news/quantum-break-actor-details-remedy-s-sweat-box-method-for-photorealistic-facial-capture/0219650 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |url-status=live |quote= It\u2019s this tiny little room with nine cameras and it captures your facial performance to an almost photo-real level.

The development team put a lot of effort into differentiating normal time and time stutters. When time enters a stutter, many audio effects change, with guns firing at a lower pitch, while dialogue and music began stretching.<ref name=\"level design\"/> The goal for the change was to allow players to recognize the change of time state \"with their eyes shut\". The team wrote a reference guide, describing the sound of time stutters. They chose words including \"violent\" and \"unpredictable\", but avoided using \"sci-fi\" and \"digital\". The team also used [[Audiokinetic Wwise]] to sync audio with gameplay.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.develop-online.net/interview/heard-about-quantum-break/0218665 |title=Heard About: Quantum Break |first=John |last=Broomhall |work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Petri Alanko, the composer of ''Alan Wake''. Alanko made use of the modular audio software [[Reaktor]], but was not satisfied with the software's built-in instruments and decided to create his own set of custom sounds. The music in the game was described by Alanko as \"meandering\" and \"sublime\" to support the game's emotional moments, while intentionally avoiding aggressive tones.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/272143/Making_waves_The_organic_process_of_creating_Quantum_Breaks_score.php |title= Making waves: The organic process of creating Quantum Break's score |first=Chris |last=Kerr |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> The soundtrack was inspired by albums from [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Hecq]], [[Michael Stearns]] and [[Aphex Twin]], and Reznorian.

Kaefer and Alanko did not cooperate with each other closely as the level of interactivity between the two mediums are different.

The game was released worldwide for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] in April 2016. The game centers on Jack Joyce, granted time manipulation powers after a failed time-machine experiment, as he comes into conflict with former friend Paul Serene over how to deal with an apocalyptic \"End of Time\". In addition, the game includes [[platform game]] elements in less action-oriented segments. There are also \"junction points\" that affect the game's outcome. The game features episodes of an integrated live-action television show, featuring the actors of the characters. The characters interact with the player's choices, displaying the results of the decisions made.\n\nThe game originally was envisioned as a sequel to Remedy's previous game, ''[[Alan Wake]]''. The game's focus was shifted to time travel, as Microsoft wanted a new [[intellectual property]] with interactive storytelling. The team consulted scientists while creating the fictional science in this game. While the video game portion was developed internally by Remedy and directed by studio veteran [[Sam Lake]], the TV side of the game was developed by Lifeboat Productions and directed by [[Ben Ketai]]. [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aidan Gillen]] and [[Lance Reddick]] portrayed important roles in the game. The game uses a new engine developed by Remedy, the Northlight engine, and a technology called [[Digital Molecular Matter]].\n\nThe game was announced in mid-2013 and was set to release in 2015, but its release was delayed to avoid competition with other Xbox One exclusives. It received a positive reception, with critics praising the game's graphics, gameplay, presentation, and story.

Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, it is impossible for the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.<ref name=\"VG\" />\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{See also|List of Quantum Break episodes}}\nAgreeing to help his best friend Paul Serene with a demonstration, Jack Joyce learns that Paul has been expanding on the physics work of Jack's estranged brother, William, and has built a time machine that works using \"chronon particles.\" Paul activates the machine, only for it to jam shut and break as William appears. Will demands Jack and Paul stop their actions, else \"time will break.\" The machine becomes unstable and douses Jack and Paul in chronon radiation that gives them time-based powers. Monarch Solutions soldiers appear and steal the time machine's core, Jack and Will meet an older Paul. Claiming to have seen the \"End of Time\", this Paul refuses Will's suggestions of fixing the fracture, claiming time cannot be changed. Paul has the building detonated, causing Will to be seemingly killed by falling debris. Jack is knocked unconscious and captured by Monarch.\n\nEscaping Monarch during a time stutter, Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, students apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch and learns that Paul was accidentally sent to the end of time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999. Escaping through the Monarch Labs, Jack and Beth pull Amaral out of the path of a hacked drone before it explodes. Beth escapes by the sea with Amaral while Jack steals Paul's car.\n\nPaul, revealed to be dying from \"chronon syndrome,\"{{efn|Caused by overexposure to chronon radiation, the illness is detrimental to his health and incurable and requires medical chronon exposure, similarly to real-life [[radiotherapy]]. The disease is implied to be what allows him to see possible futures, unlike Jack.}} lashes out at his second-in-command Martin Hatch, as Amaral was the only one capable of administering his treatment. Now paranoid, Paul places all of his trust in either Amaral or Hatch, who claims that Amaral left willingly with Jack. Paul recognizes Beth from security footage\u2014 she was also at the end of time and attempted to kill Serene.\n\nTaking Amaral to the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Beth force her to help repair the time machine. With Will's documents noting that the CFR disappeared in 2010, Jack and Beth plot to head to 2010 and steal it, closing a [[causal loop]]. Beth steps into the machine as Amaral sabotages the computer and alerts Monarch. Leaving Amaral with Nick/Amy, Jack heads to 2010 and finds Beth, much older and disturbed. Beth explains that Amaral sent her to the end of time, where she met the younger Paul. Failing to kill him, Beth followed him back to the first activation in 1999 and stopped him from murdering Will. After directing Will to create the CFR, she has waited eleven years for Jack to arrive in 2010.\n\nBeth and Jack reach Will's workshop and find the CFR, but Paul corners Beth and shoots her when she refuses to co-operate. The CFR is accidentally activated, causing a chronon burst; the exposure throws Jack forward to 2016 again and causes Paul's chronon syndrome. Beth shuts off the CFR but is executed by Paul while Jack can only watch through time.\n\nIncreasingly paranoid and ill, Paul is informed that, despite his lab being destroyed by Hatch, one damaged treatment has been recovered. Paul either decides to take it and buy time for himself and his plan or succumb to paranoia and illness. As stutters become nearly constant, Jack fights through the Monarch HQ with the guidance of either head of surveillance Charlie Wincott or Wincott's close friend Fiona Miller. Reaching Paul's lab, Jack finds and receives Wincott\u2019s aid or fights high-level Monarch security officer Liam Burke. Acquiring the CFR, Jack learns that Paul was using it to power a \"lifeboat,\" a small bunker where researchers could devise a solution to the end of time while protected from it. Unable to work the CFR, Jack uses Monarch's time machine (equipped with the stolen university core) to travel back to its first activation: the night of Will's death.\n\nRushing through the University, Jack narrowly rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, as it would erase key future events and risk a [[time paradox]]. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to unfreeze her but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to [[jump start (vehicle)|jumpstart]] it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, which in turn restabilises but does not fully repair the damage done to the Meyers-Joyce field and also disintegrates Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self-traveling to the end of time and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.\n\nIn a flash-forward, Jack is shown approaching the frozen Beth back at the University, whispering that he'll come back for her. An epilogue shows Jack leaving an interview and being approached by Hatch,{{efn|Despite Hatch's death being shown in Episode 4, additional collectibles and a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] imply that Hatch is a shifter capable of self-control and living in spaces with time.}} who explains everything has been simply blamed on Paul, and offers Jack a place at the renewed Monarch; Jack is shown seeing a split pathway similarly to Paul, ending before he makes a decision.<ref name=\"VG\">{{cite video game |title=Quantum Break |developer=[[Remedy Entertainment]] |publisher=[[Microsoft Studios]] |date=5 April 2016 |platform=[[Xbox One]] |version=1.0 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cast ===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image1 = Lance Reddick portrait 2009.jpg\n | width1 = 500 | height1 = 700\n | caption1= [[Lance Reddick]] plays Martin Hatch\n\n | image2 = Dominic Monaghan 2009 cropped.jpg\n | width2 = 500 | height2 = 700\n | caption2 = [[Dominic Monaghan]] plays William Joyce\n}}\nThe game's cast of actors was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2015.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 August 2015 |url=http://news.xbox.com/2015/08/gamescom-quantum-break |title=gamescom 2015: Quantum Break Announces an All-star Cast |publisher=Xbox Wire |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Shawn Ashmore]] as Jack Joyce\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Paul Serene, Jack's former best friend, the mastermind behind Monarch Solutions and secondary player character.\n* [[Patrick Heusinger]] as Liam Burke, one of Monarch's lead security staff, central character to the episodes, and recurring game character.\n* [[Marshall Allman]] as Charlie Wincott, Monarch's head of surveillance and central character to the episodes.\n* Courtney Hope as Beth Wilder, a Monarch [[double agent]] whom Will trusts and Jack befriends.\n* [[Mimi Michaels]] as Fiona Miller, a Monarch employee and close friend of Charlie Wincott, and central character to the episodes.\n* [[Brooke Nevin]] as Emily Burke, Liam Burke's pregnant wife and a recurring show character.\n* Jacqueline Pi\u00f1ol as Dr. Sofia Amaral, one of Serene's advisers who acts as his doctor.\n* [[Amelia Rose Blaire]] as Amy Ferrero, the lead protester who, depending on Serene's actions, is either a supporting character or is killed following the first act.\n* Sean Durrie as Nick Marsters, the taxi driver from the introduction.

Inspired by ''[[Die Hard]]'', the writers hoped that this approach would allow them to create a complex villain with depth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/11/22/remedy-s-sam-lake-details-quantum-break-s-transmedia-approach.aspx |title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake Details Quantum Break\u2019s Transmedia Approach |first=Mike |last=Futter |work=[[Game Informer]] |date=22 November 2013| accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> According to Louden, the story characters are not \"black and white\", and depending on the player's perspective, players will feel sympathy for the villain and feel torn when making the choices. Junction points were a tool used by Remedy to add replayability to the game, unlocking alternate content and changing the state of the world,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/93637/quantum-break-narrative-designer-discusses-junction-points-time-powers-and-episodic-gaming |title=Quantum Break narrative designer discusses Junction points, time powers, and episodic gaming |first=Ozzie |last=Mejia |work=[[Shacknews]] |date=8 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> and the gameplay segments remain identical regardless of players' choices.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/>\n\n''Quantum Break'' was described as a \"transmedia action-shooter video game and television hybrid\".<ref name=\"feature\"/> At its core the game is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game with a live action TV show bundled with it. According to Lake, the product was designed to be a complete package, players are encouraged to both play the game and watch the show. While the game allows players to skip the TV show completely, Remedy advise against such behaviors, as players may miss crucial details if they do not watch the show. The game features many collectibles, which serve a narrative purpose. Lake explained that once players find a collectible, they will trigger a [[butterfly effect]], whose consequences will be shown during the show. The show also shows some objects, which can be found in the core game. Through this approach, the team hoped that they could offer an experience that is unique and personalized for all players, and increase the depth of the story.<ref name=\"PolyFeature\"/> Initially, the game and the TV show were to tell drastically different stories featuring a completely different set of characters. However, Lake eventually scrapped the idea, and the game and the show echo each other more closely.<ref name=\"venturebeat\">{{cite web|url= https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/11/remedys-sam-lake-stepped-up-the-creativity-and-ambition-with-microsofts-quantum-break/ |title=How Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake stepped up the ambition and creativity of Quantum Break | first=Dean| last=Takahashi |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=11 April 2016 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> Lake described the TV show as a \"natural progression\" for the studio, having experimented with the format with the two ''Max Payne'' games, which feature televisions, and ''Alan Wake'', which has the ''Bright Falls'' live action show,<ref name=\"NL\"/> and ''[[Alan Wake: American Nightmare]]'', which features live-action cutscenes.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/> Producer Thomas Puha added that the game is \"the culmination of 21 years of work\".<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.vg247.com/2016/03/04/quantum-break-gameplay/ |title=Quantum Break is \"the culmination of 21 years of work\" |first=Danny |last=Wadeson |work=[[VG247]] |date=4 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> Lake added that the TV part can serve as an entry point for people who do not play video games frequently, and draw them into video gaming.<ref name=\"feature\"/> To keep both parts consistent, the team also consulted a filmmaker who gave them advice regarding the game's camera styles and depth of field to allow smooth transitions between the two mediums.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/12/5991679/quantum-break-remedy-entertainment-cinematic-director |title=A filmmaker is helping to make Quantum Break the most cinematic game Remedy has ever made |first=Emily |last=Gera |date=12 August 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |work= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nLake initially thought Microsoft was not particularly enthusiastic about the idea, but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/remedy-s-quantum-leap-sam-lake-on-the-studio-s-most-ambitious-game-yet/0164881 |title=Remedy's Quantum leap: Sam Lake talks about the studio's most ambitious game yet |first=Alex |last=Calvin |work=[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> However, as the TV show was not part of Microsoft's project, the closure of [[Xbox Entertainment Studios]] did not affect the progress of the TV show production.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/18/quantum-break-not-impacted-by-xbox-entertainment-studios-closure/ |title=Quantum Break not impacted by Xbox Entertainment Studios closure| first=Sinan| last=Kubba| work=[[Engadget]]| date=18 July 2014| accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through [[Skype]] conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/>\n\nWith Microsoft's funding, Remedy hired lots of high-profile actors, including [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Lance Reddick]] and [[Dominic Monaghan]]. During the game's announcement and first gameplay reveal at [[Gamescom 2014]], Jack Joyce was portrayed by Sean Durrie. According to Louden, they were creating the animation for Ashmore's character, and did not have sufficient time to finalize them before the event, so they used their game prototype, which has Durrie starring as the lead character, as the game's demo. The change in lead actors also prompted the studio to update and change the game cover art.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/15/quantum-break-gets-box-art-redesign |title=New Quantum Break Box Art Revealed |first=Alex |last=Osborn |work=[[IGN]] |date=15 August 2015 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> Ashmore, Monaghan and Gillen were announced as the game's protagonists and antagonists a year later, and Durrie starred in the game as Nick.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/>\n\n===Design===\nWhile developing the game, Remedy consulted Syksy R\u00e4s\u00e4nen, a scientist who is a lecturer at [[Helsinki University]] and had worked at [[CERN]]. He taught them how to write the plot in such a way that it adhered to current [[theoretical physics]] and [[quantum physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-break-interview-sam-lake|title=How real physics impacted time-travel game Quantum Break|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=30 June 2016|first=Matt|last=Kamen}}</ref> The development team held several brainstorming sessions, which inspired the team and helped them to fix the design of the game's time machine. The team was also inspired, when creating their own fictional \"Meyer-Joyce particle\" and \"Meyer-Joyce field\", by the [[Higgs boson]] and Higgs fields.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/>\n\nAccording to Lake, they experimented with different gameplay mechanics, some of which they judged to make the game too slow or too tactical. They intended to \"recapture the action spectacle\" featured in their ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' series, along with several modern iterations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/09/quantum-break-hands-on-preview-and-interview-we-wanted-to-recapture-the-action-spectacle-we-had-with-max-payne-5741405/ |title=Quantum Break hands-on preview and interview \u2013 \u2018we wanted to recapture the action spectacle we had with Max Payne\u2019 |first=David |last=Jenkins |work=[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]] |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> The game was designed to be fast-paced, but the concept of time-travel did not accommodate the elements of this kind of gameplay. As a result, the team opted to include a broader theme: time itself. They set the game in a world where time collapses, leading to various dangerous situations. According to Lake, the theme of time connected all the elements featured in the game. The setting also allowed the team to add new gameplay mechanics, such as the time manipulation powers.<ref name=\"venturebeat\"/> They created ''Quantum Break'' as a [[third-person shooter]] because of their past experiences with the genre and because they thought that the third-person perspective would allow them to show a strong leading character, while a purely story-oriented game would not feel like a [[AAA (video game industry)|triple A]] title.<ref name=\"GSpot TPS\"/>\n\nLouden says the team put a lot of work into the game's difficulty. They hoped that the time powers would let the player feel like a [[superhero]], while still allowing for challenging moments.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/> Learning from criticism of ''Alan Wake'', they introduced several puzzles in order to increase variety and change the pace.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/quantum-break-interview-pc-release-date-and-new-trailer/ |title=Quantum Break interview, PC release date and new trailer |first=Tom |last=Hoggins |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date= 11 February 2015 |accessdate= 30 June 2016}}</ref> The puzzles also serve to remind players of their arsenal of abilities. Some of the environmental puzzles, including the rewind feature, were inspired by titles like ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'' and ''[[Life Is Strange]]'', while the stutter sequences were inspired by ''[[Salvador Dali (film)|Salvador Dali]]'' and ''Inception'''s dream sequence.<ref name=\"Complicated story\"/>\n\nWhen time stutters occur, the game's visual changes to inform players that they will encounter new enemies and obstacles. The levels in the game were designed to feature open environments to allow players to use the time manipulation powers freely and encouraging them to explore. Kyle Rowley, lead designer of the game, described them as \"arenas\". The stutters were also designed to convey stories: Players can inspect the [[non-playable character]]s stuck in a time stutter and learn about what happened to them when time freezes. To prevent the game from relying excessively on its cover system, the [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) of the game was designed to attack the player aggressively in order to drive the player out from cover. Time powers affect AI behaviors, and Remedy built a new system that allows the AI to search for the player character after Time Rush is used.<ref name=\"level design\">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-quantum-breaks-developers-tackled-time-manipul/1100-6436820/ |title=How Quantum Break's Developers Tackled Time Manipulation Combat |first=Justin |last=Haywald |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=3 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nThe game utilizes a new in-house engine called the Northlight Engine.<ref name=\"NL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/quantum_break/b/xboxone/archive/2013/06/21/remedy-s-sam-lake-talks-quantum-break-and-alan-wake-2.aspx|title=Remedy\u2019s Sam Lake Talks Quantum Break And Alan Wake 2|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> To represent the idea of \"broken time\" and have a detailed destruction system, the team created lots of environments which put the player character in the midst of destruction, utilizing technologies ranging from geometric distortion waves to Thinking Particles.<ref name=\"tech\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fxguide.com/featured/time-for-destruction-the-tech-of-quantum-break/|title=Time for destruction: the tech of Quantum Break|first=Ian|last=Failes|work=FX Guide|date=21 April 2016|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> The team also used [[Digital Molecular Matter]], a technology developed by Pixelux that allows structures and objects to react in the game the same way they would in reality. According to Mikko Uromo, the technology allows them to \"simulate complex scenarios on a scale that hasn't been possible before\" and is crucial to the game's development.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/quantum_break/news/quantum_break_gets_advanced_digital_molecular_matter_destruction_tech.html |title=Quantum Break gets advanced 'Digital Molecular Matter' destruction tech |first=David |last=Scammell |work=VideoGamer.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref> The team also worked significantly on the game's lighting system. It was designed to be dynamic, and the team refined it to include eyes and hair. They also created a new [[global illumination]] system for indirect lighting.<ref name=\"tech\"/> The game's [[Display resolution|resolution]] foundation was [[720p]], but Remedy attempted to raise it to [[1080p]] by using [[3D reconstruction|temporal reconstruction]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-breaks-resolution-is-a-complicated-issue-s/1100-6435898/ |title=Quantum Break's Resolution Is a Complicated Issue, Says Dev |first=Tamoor |last=Hussain |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=22 March 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe team spent a lot of resources in carrying out detailed [[motion capture]], to enhance players' engagement with the story and make it easier for them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances.<ref name=\"feature\">{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4427698/quantum-break-xbox-one |title=Quantum Break Brings Binge Viewing To Video Games |first=Chris |last=Plante |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture is to convince the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records every little detail of their faces.<ref name=\"NL\"/> The team initially did the recording at [[Los Angeles]], where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in [[Helsinki]], where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a \"Sweat Box\", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Ashmore |first=Shawn |subject-link= Shawn Ashmore |interviewer= Matthew Jarvis |title=Quantum Break actor details Remedy's 'Sweat Box' method for photorealistic facial capture |url= http://www.develop-online.net/news/quantum-break-actor-details-remedy-s-sweat-box-method-for-photorealistic-facial-capture/0219650 |date= 26 April 2016 |access-date=30 June 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160427114012/http://www.develop-online.net/news/quantum-break-actor-details-remedy-s-sweat-box-method-for-photorealistic-facial-capture/0219650 |archive-date=27 April 2016 |url-status=live |quote= It\u2019s this tiny little room with nine cameras and it captures your facial performance to an almost photo-real level.

The development team put a lot of effort into differentiating normal time and time stutters. When time enters a stutter, many audio effects change, with guns firing at a lower pitch, while dialogue and music began stretching.<ref name=\"level design\"/> The goal for the change was to allow players to recognize the change of time state \"with their eyes shut\". The team wrote a reference guide, describing the sound of time stutters. They chose words including \"violent\" and \"unpredictable\", but avoided using \"sci-fi\" and \"digital\". The team also used [[Audiokinetic Wwise]] to sync audio with gameplay.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.develop-online.net/interview/heard-about-quantum-break/0218665 |title=Heard About: Quantum Break |first=John |last=Broomhall |work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Petri Alanko, the composer of ''Alan Wake''. Alanko made use of the modular audio software [[Reaktor]], but was not satisfied with the software's built-in instruments and decided to create his own set of custom sounds. The music in the game was described by Alanko as \"meandering\" and \"sublime\" to support the game's emotional moments, while intentionally avoiding aggressive tones.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/272143/Making_waves_The_organic_process_of_creating_Quantum_Breaks_score.php |title= Making waves: The organic process of creating Quantum Break's score |first=Chris |last=Kerr |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016}}</ref> The soundtrack was inspired by albums from [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Hecq]], [[Michael Stearns]] and [[Aphex Twin]], and Reznorian.

Kaefer and Alanko did not cooperate with each other closely as the level of interactivity between the two mediums are different.

In 1864, Shimla was declared as the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]], succeeding [[Murree]], northeast of [[Rawalpindi]].

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name=\"harisud\">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | accessdate=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73\u201374}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\n\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]], to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.

In 1864, Shimla was declared as the [[summer capital]] of [[British Raj|British India]], succeeding [[Murree]], northeast of [[Rawalpindi]]. After [[Indian independence movement|independence]], the city became the capital of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and was later made the capital of [[Himachal Pradesh]].

The climatic conditions attracted the British to establish the city in the dense forests of [[Himalayas]]. As the summer capital, Shimla hosted many important political meetings including the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord of 1914]] and the [[Simla Conference]] of 1945. After independence, The state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] came into being in 1948 as a result of integration of 28 [[princely state]]s. Even after independence, the city remained an important political centre, hosting the [[Simla Agreement]] of 1972. After reorganisation of state of Himachal Pradesh, the existing Mahasu district was named Shimla.\n\nShimla is home to a number of buildings that are styled in the [[Tudorbethan]] and [[neo-Gothic]] architectures dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the city attracts tourists. Attractions include the [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]], the [[Jakhoo|Jakhoo Temple]], the [[Mall Road, Shimla|Mall Road]], [[The Ridge, Shimla|the Ridge]] and [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]] which together form the city centre. The [[Kalka\u2013Shimla Railway]] line built by the British, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is also a major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race [[MTB Himalaya]], which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest [[Ice rink|natural ice skating rink]] in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is also an educational hub with a number of colleges and research institutions.\n\n==History==\nMost of the area occupied by present-day Shimla city was dense forest during the 18th century. The only civilisation was the [[Jakhoo]] temple and a few scattered houses.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\">{{cite book | author=Vipin Pubby | title=Shimla Then and Now | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrZ-ibfhMyMC&pg=PA17 | accessdate=16 August 2013 | year=1996 | publisher=Indus Publishing | isbn=978-81-7387-046-0 | pages=17\u201334}}</ref> The area was called 'Shimla', named after a [[Hindu goddess]], ''Shyamala Devi'', an incarnation of [[Kali]].<ref name=\"hpshimla.nic.in\"/>\n\n[[File:Shimla, 1850s.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The bridge connecting Shimla with Chhota Shimla, originally erected in 1829 by Lord Combermere, Shimla, 1850s]]\nThe area of present-day Shimla was invaded and captured by [[Bhimsen Thapa]] of [[Nepal]] in 1806. The [[British East India Company]] took control of the territory as per the [[Sugauli Treaty]] after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814\u201316). The [[Gurkha]] leaders were quelled by storming the fort of Malaun under the command of [[David Ochterlony]] in May 1815. In a diary entry dated 30 August 1817, the Gerard brothers, who surveyed the area, describe Shimla as \"a middling-sized village where a fakir is situated to give water to the travellers\". In 1819, Lieutenant Ross, the Assistant Political Agent in the [[Hill States of India#|Hill States]], set up a wood cottage in Shimla. Three years later, his successor and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] civil servant [[Charles Pratt Kennedy]] built the first [[pucca housing|pucca house]] in the area in 1822, near [[Annadale, Shimla|Annadale]], what is now the [[Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] building. The accounts of the Britain-like climate started attracting several British officers to the area during the hot Indian summers. By 1826, some officers had started spending their entire vacation in Shimla. In 1827, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], the [[Governor-General of Bengal]], visited Shimla and stayed in the Kennedy House. A year later, [[Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere|Lord Combermere]], the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India, stayed at the same residence. During his stay, a three-mile road and a bridge were constructed near [[Jakhoo]]. In 1830, the British acquired the surrounding land from the chiefs of [[Keonthal]] and [[Patiala]] in exchange for the Rawin [[pargana]] and a portion of the Bharauli pargana. The settlement grew rapidly after this, from 30 houses in 1830 to 1,141 houses in 1881.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Harrop, F.

In a letter to Colonel Churchill, he wrote:<ref>Researches and Missionary Labours Among the Jews, Mohammedans, and Other Sects By Joseph Wolff, published by O.

After this, the town was under Nawab (King) Kumar Ghosal of Bally, West Bengal and saw regular visits from the Governors General and Commanders-in-Chief of British India. A number of young British officers started visiting the area to socialise with the higher-ups; they were followed by ladies looking for marriage alliances for their relatives. Shimla thus became a hill station famous for balls, parties and other festivities. Subsequently, residential schools for pupils from upper-class families were established nearby. By the late 1830s, the city also became a centre for theatre and art exhibitions. As the population increased, a number of bungalows were built and a big bazaar was established in the town. The Indian businessmen, mainly from [[Sood]] and [[Parsi]] communities, arrived in the area to cater to the needs of the growing European population. On 9 September 1844 the foundation of the [[Christ Church (Shimla)|Christ Church]] was laid. Subsequently, several roads were widened and the construction of the [[National Highway 22 (India)|Hindustan-Tibet road]] with a 560-feet tunnel was taken up in 1851\u201352. This tunnel, now known as the Dhalli Tunnel, was started by a Major Briggs in 1850 and completed in the winter of 1851\u201352.<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080206/himplus1.htm#2 |title=Shimla A five-tunnel town|publisher=tribuneindia.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The [[1857 uprising]] caused a panic among the European residents of the town, but Shimla remained largely unaffected by the rebellion.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\"/>\n\nIn 1863, the [[Viceroy of India]], [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]], decided to shift the summer capital of the British Raj to Shimla.<ref name=\"Vipin1996\" /> He took the trouble of moving the administration twice a year between [[Calcutta]] and this separate centre over 1,000 miles away, despite the fact that it was difficult to reach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]], ''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007</ref> [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] ([[Viceroy of India]] 1876\u20131880) made efforts to plan the town from 1876, when he first stayed in a rented house, but began plans for a [[Rashtrapati Niwas|Viceregal Lodge]], later built on Observatory Hill. A fire cleared much of the area where the native Indian population lived (the \"Upper Bazaar\" nowadays known as the [[The Ridge, Shimla|Ridge]]<ref name=\"harisud\">{{cite book | author=Hari Sud | title=Entrepreneurs of British Shimla | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8aRBQAAQBAJ | accessdate=15 August 2015 | year=2013 | publisher=Lulu | isbn=978-1-304-11357-3 | pages=73\u201374}}</ref>), and the planning of the eastern end to become the centre of the European town forced them to live in the Middle and Lower Bazaars on the lower terraces descending the steep slopes from the Ridge. The Upper Bazaar was cleared for a town hall, with many facilities such as library and theatre, as well as offices for police and military volunteers as well as municipal administration.\n\nDuring the \"Hot Weather\", Shimla was also the Headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the head of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], and many departments of [[Government of India|the government]]. The summer capital of the regional Government of the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] moved from [[Murree]], in modern-day [[Pakistan]], to Shimla in 1876. They were joined by many of the British wives and daughters of the men who remained on the plains. Together these formed Shimla Society, which, according to [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]],<ref>''[[Kipling Sahib]]'', London, Little Brown, 2007: p. 134</ref> \"was as close as British India ever came to having an upper crust.\" This may have been helped by the fact that it was very expensive, having an ideal climate and thus being desirable, as well as having limited accommodation. British soldiers, merchants and civil servants moved here each year to escape from the heat during summer in the [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]. The presence of many bachelors and unattached men, as well as the many women passing the hot weather there, gave Shimla a reputation for adultery, and at least gossip about adultery: as [[Rudyard Kipling]] said in a letter cited by Allen, it had a reputation for \"frivolity, gossip and intrigue\".<ref name=\"heritagereport\">{{cite web | url = http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | title = Heritage of Shimla | publisher = Town & Country Planning Department, Shimla | accessdate = 4 May 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171701/http://himachal.nic.in/tcp/ShimlaHeritageReport.pdf | archivedate = 30 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|500|ft|adj=on}} Lower Bazaar tunnel was built in 1905 and christened Khachhar Surang.
