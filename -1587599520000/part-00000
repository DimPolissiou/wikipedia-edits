It allowed for the need to enhance pilot control of the [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-27M]] (later renamed Su-35), which was a further development of the [[Su-27]]. The sole aircraft had originally been built as the eleventh Su-27M (T10M-11) by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] before having its thrust-vectoring nozzles installed. In addition, it was modified with updated flight- and weapons-control systems. The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] in April&nbsp;1996. Throughout the flight-test program, the Su-37 demonstrated its [[supermaneuverability|supermanoeuvrability]] at [[air show]]s, performing manoeuvres such as a [[Kulbit|360-degree somersault]]. The aircraft crashed in December 2002 due to structural failure. The Su-37 did not enter production; despite a report in 1998 which claimed that Sukhoi had built a second Su-37 using the twelfth Su-27M airframe,<ref>Gethin 1998, p. 32.</ref> T10M-11 remained the sole prototype. Sukhoi had instead applied the aircraft's systems to the design bureau's other fighter designs.\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nThe Sukhoi Design Bureau started research on [[thrust vectoring]] as early as 1983,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M, which was an upgrade of the Su-27.<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> At the insistence of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the [[Chaplygin Siberian Scientific Research Institute Of Aviation|Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute]] studied [[Wiktionary:axisymmetric|axisymmetrical]] vectoring nozzles. This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional nozzles in the Western press. [[Lyulka]] (later [[UEC Saturn|Lyulka-Saturn]]) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;146\u2013147.</ref> By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using its flying test beds.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;55.</ref>\n<!--\nMeanwhile, Sukhoi was busy with the T10M (later renamed ''Su-35'' in 1993) program, which was a comprehensive upgrade of the Su-27. The T10M would incorporate aerodynamic modifications, improved avionics and [[armament]], and have a better [[Turbofan|propulsion system]], designed to give it [[Supermaneuverability|greatly enhanced agility]].<ref name=Eden>{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=469.}}</ref> The first Su-27M prototype (T-10S-70) made its maiden flight on 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;1988.<ref name=\"Gordon p. 62\">{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=62.}}</ref> Later Su-35 prototypes featured [[glass cockpit]]s and modified [[vertical stabilizer]]s.<ref name=Eden/>\n\n[[File:Su-37 Kulbit.png|thumb|The Su-37 could perform the 360\u00b0 \"[[Kulbit|Frolov Chakra]]\", demonstrating its [[supermaneuverability]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Siuru|first=William|title=Supermaneuverability|journal=Airpower Journal|publisher=Air University Press|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj88/spr88/siuru.html|year=1998|accessdate=22 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207060039/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj88/spr88/siuru.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|issn=0897-0823}}</ref>]]-->\n\nDuring test flights of the Su-27Ms, which began in 1988, engineers discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] due to the ineffectiveness of [[flight control surfaces]] at low speeds. Engineers therefore installed thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] in the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] and was being used as a radar test bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 151.</ref> Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles on the aircraft.<ref name=G07_p151/>{{#tag:ref|According to ''[[Flight International]]'', engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft in late 1994.<ref>Barrie 1994, p.&nbsp;16.</ref>|group=\"N\"}} Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight-cleared. The aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU.<ref name=G07_p151>Gordon 2007, p. 151.</ref> The aircraft was rolled out in May.<ref>''Aviation Week & Space Technology'' 1995, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch axis]], together or differentially.<ref>Novichkov 1996, pp.&nbsp;52, 55.</ref><!--The engine not only incorporates a new-generation 2D TVC nozzle but also is resistant to engine [[compressor stall|surge]] even during inverted and flat spins, giving better reliability and maneuverability even when the [[angle of attack]] is 180\u00b0.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=69.}}</ref>-->\n\nApart from the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles, the Su-37 did not outwardly differ much from the canard-equipped Su-27M. Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft's avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system.<ref name=N96_p52>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> Together with the aircraft's overall high [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] and the engine's [[full authority digital engine control]] feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems added maneuverability at high angles of attack and low speeds.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;151, 154.</ref> The aircraft's [[fire-control system|weapons-control system]] had also been improved, as it included an [[Bars radar|N011M Bars]] (literally \"Panther\") [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was capable of tracking twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M's baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref><ref name=Gordon_2007_p158>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;158.</ref> The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55/><!-- The Su-37 also features an upgraded [[electronic warfare support measures]] package.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|pp=64\u201366.}}</ref>-->\n\nConsiderable improvement had also been made to the cockpit layout. In addition to the [[head-up display]], the Su-37 had four [[Thales Group|Sextant Avionique]] [[Multi-function display|multi-function]] colour [[liquid crystal display]]s arranged in a \"T\" configuration; they had better backlight protection than the Su-27M's monochrome [[cathode ray tube]] displays. The displays presented to the pilot information about navigation, systems status, and weapons selection. The pilot sat on an [[ejection seat]] that was reclined to 30&nbsp;degrees to improve [[g-force]] tolerance.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55/><ref name=Gordon_2007_p154>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;154.</ref> <!--The pilot steers with a [[side-stick]] and pressure-sensing throttles.<ref name=\"Gordon p. 65\">{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=65.}}</ref> The two-grip flying control configuration was designed to prevent the pilot from losing contact with the controls when the aircraft is engaged in fast vectored-thrust maneuvers.

According to Simonov, such a feature would allow pilots to develop new combat manoeuvres and tactics, greatly enhancing its effectiveness in dogfights.<ref>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;50.</ref> Among the new manoeuvres was the Super Cobra, which was a variation of the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and was demonstrated during the aircraft's international debut at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] in September 1996. Piloted by Frolov, the aircraft pitched up 180&nbsp;degrees and maintained the tail-first position momentarily, which would theoretically allow the aircraft to fire a missile at a combat opponent.<ref name=Gordon_2007_p158/> The Super Cobra evolved into the ''[[kulbit]]'' (somersault), in which the Su-37 performed a 360-degree loop with an extremely tight turning radius the length of the aircraft.<ref>Velovich September 1996, p.&nbsp;41.</ref> According to test pilot [[Anatoly Kvochur]], thrust vectoring would have given the aircraft a considerable advantage in close-in [[dogfight]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski |first=Piotr |title=Su-37 dogfights will be '10 times as effective'|journal=Jane's Defence Weekly|location=Horley, UK|date=10 July 1996|issn=0265-3818}}</ref> Nonetheless, critics have questioned the practical benefits of such manoeuvres; although they would allow an early [[Radar lock-on|missile lock-on]], it would come at the expense of a rapid loss of [[kinetic energy]], which would leave the aircraft vulnerable when pilots missed their first shot.<ref>''Flight International'' 1996, p&nbsp;3: \"If the pilot does not kill the opposition with his first shot, then his own aircraft's lack of energy will means {{sic}} he could present an attractive target.\"</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was demonstrated at the [[Paris Air Show]] in 1997.

It allowed for the need to enhance pilot control of the [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-27M]] (later renamed Su-35), which was a further development of the [[Su-27]]. The sole aircraft had originally been built as the eleventh Su-27M (T10M-11) by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] before having its thrust-vectoring nozzles installed. In addition, it was modified with updated flight- and weapons-control systems. The aircraft made its [[maiden flight]] in April&nbsp;1996. Throughout the flight-test program, the Su-37 demonstrated its [[supermaneuverability|supermanoeuvrability]] at [[air show]]s, performing manoeuvres such as a [[Kulbit|360-degree somersault]]. The aircraft crashed in December 2002 due to structural failure. The Su-37 did not enter production; despite a report in 1998 which claimed that Sukhoi had built a second Su-37 using the twelfth Su-27M airframe,<ref>Gethin 1998, p. 32.</ref> T10M-11 remained the sole prototype. Sukhoi had instead applied the aircraft's systems to the design bureau's other fighter designs.\n\n== Design and development ==\n\nThe Sukhoi Design Bureau started research on [[thrust vectoring]] as early as 1983,<ref>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M, which was an upgrade of the Su-27.<ref>Andrews 2003, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> At the insistence of [[General Director]] [[Mikhail Simonov]], who had been the chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the [[Chaplygin Siberian Scientific Research Institute Of Aviation|Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute]] studied [[Wiktionary:axisymmetric|axisymmetrical]] vectoring nozzles. This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional nozzles in the Western press. [[Lyulka]] (later [[UEC Saturn|Lyulka-Saturn]]) also began studies of thrust-vectoring engines in 1985.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;146\u2013147.</ref> By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using its flying test beds.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;55.</ref>\n<!--\nMeanwhile, Sukhoi was busy with the T10M (later renamed ''Su-35'' in 1993) program, which was a comprehensive upgrade of the Su-27. The T10M would incorporate aerodynamic modifications, improved avionics and [[armament]], and have a better [[Turbofan|propulsion system]], designed to give it [[Supermaneuverability|greatly enhanced agility]].<ref name=Eden>{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=469.}}</ref> The first Su-27M prototype (T-10S-70) made its maiden flight on 28&nbsp;June&nbsp;1988.<ref name=\"Gordon p. 62\">{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=62.}}</ref> Later Su-35 prototypes featured [[glass cockpit]]s and modified [[vertical stabilizer]]s.<ref name=Eden/>\n\n[[File:Su-37 Kulbit.png|thumb|The Su-37 could perform the 360\u00b0 \"[[Kulbit|Frolov Chakra]]\", demonstrating its [[supermaneuverability]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Siuru|first=William|title=Supermaneuverability|journal=Airpower Journal|publisher=Air University Press|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj88/spr88/siuru.html|year=1998|accessdate=22 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207060039/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj88/spr88/siuru.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|issn=0897-0823}}</ref>]]-->\n\nDuring test flights of the Su-27Ms, which began in 1988, engineers discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] due to the ineffectiveness of [[flight control surfaces]] at low speeds. Engineers therefore installed thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] in the [[Russian Far East|country's Far East]] and was being used as a radar test bed.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;142, 151.</ref> Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles on the aircraft.<ref name=G07_p151/>{{#tag:ref|According to ''[[Flight International]]'', engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft in late 1994.<ref>Barrie 1994, p.&nbsp;16.</ref>|group=\"N\"}} Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight-cleared. The aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU.<ref name=G07_p151>Gordon 2007, p. 151.</ref> The aircraft was rolled out in May.<ref>''Aviation Week & Space Technology'' 1995, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch axis]], together or differentially.<ref>Novichkov 1996, pp.&nbsp;52, 55.</ref><!--The engine not only incorporates a new-generation 2D TVC nozzle but also is resistant to engine [[compressor stall|surge]] even during inverted and flat spins, giving better reliability and maneuverability even when the [[angle of attack]] is 180\u00b0.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=69.}}</ref>-->\n\nApart from the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles, the Su-37 did not outwardly differ much from the canard-equipped Su-27M. Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft's avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]], which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system.<ref name=N96_p52>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> Together with the aircraft's overall high [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] and the engine's [[full authority digital engine control]] feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems added maneuverability at high angles of attack and low speeds.<ref>Gordon 2007, pp.&nbsp;151, 154.</ref> The aircraft's [[fire-control system|weapons-control system]] had also been improved, as it included an [[Bars radar|N011M Bars]] (literally \"Panther\") [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was capable of tracking twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M's baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butowski|first=Piotr|date=1 November 1999|title=Dominance by design: the reign of Russia's 'Flankers' \u2013 PART ONE|journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]|location=Coulsdon, UK|volume=11|issue=11|issn=1350-6226}}</ref><ref name=Gordon_2007_p158>Gordon 2007, p.&nbsp;158.</ref> The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.<ref name=Novichkov_1996_p55/><!-- The Su-37 also features an upgraded [[electronic warfare support measures]] package.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordon|1999|pp=64\u201366.}}</ref>-->\n\nConsiderable improvement had also been made to the cockpit layout. In addition to the [[head-up display]], the Su-37 had four [[Thales Group|Sextant Avionique]] [[Multi-function display|multi-function]] colour [[liquid crystal display]]s arranged in a \"T\" configuration; they had better backlight protection than the Su-27M's monochrome [[cathode ray tube]] displays. The displays presented to the pilot information about navigation, systems status, and weapons selection.

According to Simonov, such a feature would allow pilots to develop new combat manoeuvres and tactics, greatly enhancing its effectiveness in dogfights.<ref>Novichkov 1996, p.&nbsp;50.</ref> Among the new manoeuvres was the Super Cobra, which was a variation of the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and was demonstrated during the aircraft's international debut at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] in September 1996.

{"title_page": "John Ferdinand Smyth Stuart", "text_new": "[[File:Ferdinand Smyth Stuart.jpeg|thumb|Ferdinand Smyth Stuart, 1808]]\n'''John Ferdinand Smyth Stuart''' (1745 \u2013 20 December 1814), known until 1793 as '''John Ferdinand Smyth''' and mostly after that as '''Ferdinand Smyth Stuart''', was a Scottish-born American [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|loyalist]] and physician who claimed to be a great-grandson of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. As the author of ''A Tour in the United States of America'' (1784), he used the name '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth'''. \n\nLeaving America during the Revolutionary War, Stuart spent the rest of his life in England and the West Indies.\n==Background and early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Smyth or John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of R. Wentworth Smyth, a gentleman who had fought in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]] and also the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|later one of 1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, as his second wife. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], a son of Charles II, and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth|Thomas, Lord Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and that a Colonel Smyth, who had been an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, had adopted her son and made him his own heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France. He returned to Scotland at the time of the 1715 Rising.<ref name=monthly>\u201cMemoirs of FERDINAND SMYTH STUART, M.D., Major in the British Army, and Grandson of the Duke of Monmouth\u201d, in ''The Monthly Magazine'', 1 February 1815, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6m76vtrNAJkC&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 36\u201341]</ref> Stuart stated in 1808 that he was named after his godfather, [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince  Ferdinand of Brunswick]].<ref>Ferdinand  Smyth Stuart, ''Destiny and Fortitude'' (1808) p. 42</ref> A genealogist, [[Anthony J. Camp]], has cast doubts on this account.<ref name=AJC>[[Anthony J. Camp]], [http://anthonyjcamp.com/page20.htm John Ferdinand Smyth: loyalist and liar] at anthonyjcamp.com, as published in ''Genealogists' Magazine'', vol. 31, no. 11 (September 2015)</ref> On Henrietta Maria Wentworth, [[Allan Fea]] was convinced that Monmouth \u201dundoubtedly left a son by her (born in 1681), who was adopted and educated in Paris by Colonel Smyth\u201d, but no evidence of the existence of Maria Julia Dalziel has yet come to light.<ref name=AJC/>\n\nStuart recalled being orphaned by the death of his mother when he was two and his father when he was five, his father being drowned in a river, after falling off a bridge during an attempt to arrest him.<ref name=monthly/> According to Stuart, he was \u201cbred to Physic and was at one of the Scotch Universities\u201d and migrated to Virginia in the year 1763.<ref name=AJC/> An obituary  said that Stuart had been a Doctor of Medicine and had been educated \u201camid the Grampian hills\u201d, and then had \u201cattended the lectures of [[John Gregory (moralist)|Dr Gregory]]\u201d at Aberdeen,<ref name=monthly/> but no university career has been traced.<ref name=AJC/>\n\n==Life in America==\nStuart emigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and settled near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], where he later practised as a physician. By the 1770s, he had became a planter, renting plantations rather than owning them.<ref name=AJC/> The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to Great Britain, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|Loyalist forces]]. He served in several regiments in the rank of captain. He later wrote that at one time he commanded an armed sloop in [[Chesapeake Bay]] and at another raised a company of men for frontier work. More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nAt New York, at about the end of 1777, Captain Smyth wrote his ''Narrative or Journal of Capt. John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth, of the Queen's Rangers'', setting out his adventures, and was critical of the \u201cdeluded and mistaken\u201d rebels. This was printed in 1778.<ref>''Narrative or Journal of Capt. John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth, of the Queen's Rangers'', reprinted in ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1915), pp. 143-169</ref> He was then an officer of the [[Queen's Rangers]], a Loyalist regiment stationed at King's Bridge, New York, from July 1778.<ref name=AJC/> On 23 October 1778, he married Abigail Haugewout, the daughter of a loyalist farmer in Hempstead, on [[Long Island]], and their daughter Elizabeth was born in 1780.<ref name=hofstra/>\n\nStuart had leave to be absent from two [[Muster (military)|musters]] in 1778, in one August and another in October, but he was on duty in February 1779. In May 1779, he launched a number of proceedings against his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Graves Simcoe]], but they were found to be \u201cMalicious, Frivolous, Vexatious, & Groundless\u201d. Simcoe claimed that Captain Smyth \u201cavoided military service whenever possible\u201d. At a muster in June 1779, he had sick leave, and not far into 1780, he returned to England, on the grounds of ill health.<ref name=AJC/>\n\n==England and West Indies==\nStuart remained an officer on half-pay for the duration of the American War. The British government had set up a Commission to give financial help to loyalists with losses from the war, and in 1780 they awarded Stuart \u00a3100 a year as an interim allowance, increasing this to \u00a3200 in 1781 and to \u00a3300 in 1783. He made an application to the Privy Council, asking to be awarded [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], a Crown property in [[the Bahamas]], in view of his claimed losses of 3,300 acres in Virginia and Maryland, but he was not believed and this was rejected.

Therefore, in patients with chronic [[mitral stenosis]], pulmonary capillary pressures of 40 to 45&nbsp;mm Hg have been measured without the development of lethal pulmonary edema.[Guytun and Hall physiology]\n\nHypoxia exists when there is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body. Hypoxemia refers to a reduction in PO2 below the normal range, regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung, CaO2 is adequate, or tissue hypoxia exists. There are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia, but in patients with [[COPD]] the predominant one is V/Q mismatching, with or without alveolar hypoventilation, as indicated by PaCO2. Hypoxemia caused by V/Q mismatching as seen in COPD is relatively easy to correct, so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (less than 3 L/min for the majority of patients) are required for [[LTOT]]. Although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea, these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with COPD as to be of limited value in patient assessment. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonale\u2014right ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failure\u2014in patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in COPD, to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by [[FEV1]] is the best correlate with overall prognosis in patients with COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease. Large-scale studies of LTOT in patients with COPD have demonstrated a [[dose\u2013response relationship]] between daily hours of oxygen use and survival. There is reason to believe that continuous, 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the NOTT and MRC studies.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10771781 | volume=45 | issue=1 | title=Pathophysiology and clinical effects of chronic hypoxia | year=2000 | journal=Respir Care | pages=39\u201351; discussion 51\u20133| last1=Pierson | first1=D.

[[Acclimatization]], the means by which the body adapts to higher altitudes, only partially restores p{{chem|O|2}} to standard levels. [[Hyperventilation]], the body's most common response to high-altitude conditions, increases alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} by raising the depth and rate of breathing. However, while p{{chem|O|2}} does improve with hyperventilation, it does not return to normal. Studies of miners and astronomers working at 3000 meters and above show improved alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} with full acclimatization, yet the p{{chem|O|2}} level remains equal to or even below the threshold for continuous oxygen therapy for patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).<ref name=\"West 2004 789\u2013800\">{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=2004 |title=The Physiologic Basis of High-Altitude Diseases |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=141 |pages=789\u2013800 |issue=10 |pmid=15545679 |author2=American College Of Physicians |author3=American Physiological Society |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-141-10-200411160-00010}}</ref> In addition, there are complications involved with acclimatization. [[Polycythemia]], in which the body increases the number of red blood cells in circulation, thickens the blood, raising the danger that the heart can't pump it.\n\nIn high-altitude conditions, only oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of hypoxia. By increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air, the effects of lower barometric pressure are countered and the level of arterial p{{chem|O|2}} is restored toward normal capacity. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 4000&nbsp;m, raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an altitude equivalent of 3000&nbsp;m, which is much more tolerable for the increasing number of low-landers who work in high altitude.<ref>{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=1995 |title=Oxygen Enrichment of Room Air to Relieve the Hypoxia of High Altitude |journal=Respiration Physiology |volume=99 |pages=225\u201332 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G |issue=2 |pmid=7777705}}</ref> In a study of astronomers working in Chile at 5050&nbsp;m, oxygen concentrators increased the level of oxygen concentration by almost 30 percent (that is, from 21 percent to 27 percent).

They require little maintenance and electricity, provide a constant source of oxygen, and eliminate the expensive, and often dangerous, task of transporting oxygen cylinders to remote areas. Offices and housing already have climate-controlled rooms, in which temperature and humidity are kept at a constant level. Oxygen can be added to this system easily and relatively cheaply.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nA prescription renewal for home oxygen following hospitalization requires an assessment of the patient for ongoing hypoxemia.<ref name=\"ACCPandATSfive\">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Chest Physicians |author1-link = American College of Chest Physicians |author2 = American Thoracic Society |author2-link = American Thoracic Society |date = September 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Chest Physicians and American Thoracic Society |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-chest-physicians-and-american-thoracic-society/ |accessdate = 6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the [[Hulu]] [[web television]] series ''[[The Path (TV series)#Episodes|The Path]]'', season 3 episode 1, Sarah has Cal give her an \"hypoxian cleanse\", consisting of her \"unburdening\" (reciting her transgressions) while he tightened bonds around her [[autoerotic asphyxiation|neck]] and torso to cut off the oxygen flow, in an effort to help ease her guilt about her actions in season 2.

Hypoxic breathing gases can be defined as mixtures with a lower oxygen fraction than air, though gases containing sufficient oxygen to reliably maintain consciousness at normal sea level atmospheric pressure may be described as normoxic even when slightly hypoxic. Hypoxic mixtures in this context are those which will not reliably maintain consciousness at sea level pressure.

Therefore, in patients with chronic [[mitral stenosis]], pulmonary capillary pressures of 40 to 45&nbsp;mm Hg have been measured without the development of lethal pulmonary edema.[Guytun and Hall physiology]\n\nHypoxia exists when there is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body. Hypoxemia refers to a reduction in PO2 below the normal range, regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung, CaO2 is adequate, or tissue hypoxia exists. There are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia, but in patients with [[COPD]] the predominant one is V/Q mismatching, with or without alveolar hypoventilation, as indicated by PaCO2. Hypoxemia caused by V/Q mismatching as seen in COPD is relatively easy to correct, so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (less than 3 L/min for the majority of patients) are required for [[LTOT]]. Although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea, these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with COPD as to be of limited value in patient assessment. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonale\u2014right ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failure\u2014in patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in COPD, to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by [[FEV1]] is the best correlate with overall prognosis in patients with COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease. Large-scale studies of LTOT in patients with COPD have demonstrated a [[dose\u2013response relationship]] between daily hours of oxygen use and survival. There is reason to believe that continuous, 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the NOTT and MRC studies.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10771781 | volume=45 | issue=1 | title=Pathophysiology and clinical effects of chronic hypoxia | year=2000 | journal=Respir Care | pages=39\u201351; discussion 51\u20133| last1=Pierson | first1=D.

[[Acclimatization]], the means by which the body adapts to higher altitudes, only partially restores p{{chem|O|2}} to standard levels. [[Hyperventilation]], the body's most common response to high-altitude conditions, increases alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} by raising the depth and rate of breathing. However, while p{{chem|O|2}} does improve with hyperventilation, it does not return to normal. Studies of miners and astronomers working at 3000 meters and above show improved alveolar p{{chem|O|2}} with full acclimatization, yet the p{{chem|O|2}} level remains equal to or even below the threshold for continuous oxygen therapy for patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).<ref name=\"West 2004 789\u2013800\">{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=2004 |title=The Physiologic Basis of High-Altitude Diseases |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=141 |pages=789\u2013800 |issue=10 |pmid=15545679 |author2=American College Of Physicians |author3=American Physiological Society |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-141-10-200411160-00010}}</ref> In addition, there are complications involved with acclimatization. [[Polycythemia]], in which the body increases the number of red blood cells in circulation, thickens the blood, raising the danger that the heart can't pump it.\n\nIn high-altitude conditions, only oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of hypoxia. By increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air, the effects of lower barometric pressure are countered and the level of arterial p{{chem|O|2}} is restored toward normal capacity. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 4000&nbsp;m, raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an altitude equivalent of 3000&nbsp;m, which is much more tolerable for the increasing number of low-landers who work in high altitude.<ref>{{cite journal |last=West |first=John B. |year=1995 |title=Oxygen Enrichment of Room Air to Relieve the Hypoxia of High Altitude |journal=Respiration Physiology |volume=99 |pages=225\u201332 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G |issue=2 |pmid=7777705}}</ref> In a study of astronomers working in Chile at 5050&nbsp;m, oxygen concentrators increased the level of oxygen concentration by almost 30 percent (that is, from 21 percent to 27 percent).

They require little maintenance and electricity, provide a constant source of oxygen, and eliminate the expensive, and often dangerous, task of transporting oxygen cylinders to remote areas. Offices and housing already have climate-controlled rooms, in which temperature and humidity are kept at a constant level. Oxygen can be added to this system easily and relatively cheaply.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nA prescription renewal for home oxygen following hospitalization requires an assessment of the patient for ongoing hypoxemia.<ref name=\"ACCPandATSfive\">{{Citation |author1 = American College of Chest Physicians |author1-link = American College of Chest Physicians |author2 = American Thoracic Society |author2-link = American Thoracic Society |date = September 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Chest Physicians and American Thoracic Society |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-chest-physicians-and-american-thoracic-society/ |accessdate = 6 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the [[Hulu]] [[web television]] series ''[[The Path (TV series)#Episodes|The Path]]'', season 3 episode 1, Sarah has Cal give her an \"hypoxian cleanse\", consisting of her \"unburdening\" (reciting her transgressions) while he tightened bonds around her [[autoerotic asphyxiation|neck]] and torso to cut off the oxygen flow, in an effort to help ease her guilt about her actions in season 2.

In the early 1980s, she moved toward a [[new wave music|new wave]] style that drew on [[reggae]], [[funk]], [[post-punk]] and [[pop music]], frequently collaborating with both the graphic designer [[Jean-Paul Goude]] and the musical duo [[Sly & Robbie]]. Her most popular albums include ''[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]'' (1980), ''[[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)|Nightclubbing]]'' (1981), and ''[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]'' (1985).
