The inscription mentions the Raja of Chamba facing an attack by Kiras aided by the Lord of Durgara (''durg\u0101re\u015bwara''). In medieval times the term ''Durgar'' is believed to have turned into ''Dugar'', eventually transforming to \"Dogra\". Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' makes no mention of a kingdom by any of these names, but the kingdoms could have been referred to by their capital cities (such as ''Vallapura'', modern [[Billawar]], or ''Babbapura'', modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the [[Dogri language]], irrespective of their religion.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==History==\nScholar Omachanda Handa believes that the Durgara people were originally migrants from Rajasthan to the [[Terai]] belt, similar to the [[Gurjaras]] (or \"Gujjars\"). The allusion to ''durg'' (fort) in their name indicates that they may have remained a warrior people, eventually founding powerful kingdoms between [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], and possibly dominating up to the [[Sutlej River|Sutluj]] river.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nAccording to [[M. A. Stein]], there were some eleven Dogra states in the region, all of which were eventually absorbed into the [[Jammu]] state, which emerged as the most powerful among them.{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1900|p=432}} Prior to the rise of Jammu, Babbapura (Babor) is expected to have been the chief state of Dogras. Lying 45 km east of Jammu, Babor contains the ruins of six magnificent temples representing a \"thriving artistic activity\".<ref name=\"Saraf1987\">{{citation |last=Saraf |first=D.

The lower Himalayan ranges begin behind the town of Jammu, which rests on a slope over {{convert|1300|ft}} above sea level, overlooking and commanding the plain watered by the [[Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Tawi River|Tawi]] and [[Ujh River|Ujh]] rivers. The Jammu region consists of ten districts: [[Jammu]], [[Kathua]], [[Udhampur]], [[Doda district|Doda]], [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]], [[Kishtwar]], [[Reasi]], [[Samba, Jammu|Samba]], [[Ramban district|Ramban]] and [[Rajouri]]. The city of Jammu is the winter capital of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].\n\nThe Jammu Dogras traditionally inhabited the area between the slopes of the [[Sivalik Hills|Shivalik range]] of mountains, the sacred lakes of Saroien sar and Mannsar but later spread over whole of Jammu region. They generally speak Dogri and other dialects similar to Dogri. The majority of the Dogra are followers of [[Hindu]]ism, but a large number in Jammu and Kashmir believe in other religions. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some Dogras embraced [[Islam]]. These factors, together with the effects of immigration into the region, have resulted in the Dogra population of Jammu and Kashmir including members of all three religions. \n\nThe [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Raj]] emerged as a regional power, particularly after Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] emerged as a warrior and his subjects received special martial recognition from the [[British Raj]]. The rule of Gulab Singh's Raj extended over the whole of the Jammu Region, a large part of the Ladakh region as early as March 1846, and a large part of the Indian Punjab (now [[Himachal Pradesh]]). The [[Kashmir Valley]] was handed over to Gulab Singh by the British government, as part of the territories ceded to the British government by Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the [[Treaty of Lahore]] dated 9{{nbsp}}March 1846. Under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] in the same year, the Dogra king of Jammu and the state was thereafter known as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir State (Raj), also thereafter referred as Kashmir State. The term Dogra hence is more akin to the subjects of Himachal Pradesh, some areas of Punjab and the whole region of Jammu that was ruled by Raja Gulab Singh as part of the Dogra Raj irrespective of the religion of the inhabitants.\n\n===Cultural profile===\n* ''Kud'', a ritual dance performed in honour of Lok Devatas. This dance style is performed mostly at night. It is spontaneous and people of all ages and sexes participate. Instruments used during the Kud are Narshingha, chhaina, flute, drumsm etc. The rhythm of music controls the movement of participants. This dance continues for the whole night.

They traced their ancestry to the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] (Solar) Dynasty of [[Northern India]] (the same clan in which [[Lord Rama]] was born; he, therefore, is the 'kuldevta' (family deity) of the Dogras). \n[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|[[Gulab Singh]], the first Maharaja of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]], the last monarch of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n\nAmong the enlightened rulers of Jammu was Raja Ranjit Dev (1728\u20131780) who introduced certain social reforms such as a ban on '[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]' (immolation of the wife on the funeral pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Later, under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the state became part of the [[Sikh Empire]] of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] after it was captured from its Afghan rulers. Ranjit Singh rendered this state to his general, [[Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal]], who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. He extended the boundaries of Jammu to western Tibet with the help of General Zorawar Singh. \n\nThe Sikh Empire rule extended beyond the Jammu Region and the [[Kashmir Valley]] to the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of [[Ladakh]] and the Emirates of [[State of Hunza|Hunza]], [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] and [[State of Nagar|Nagar]]. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, the British gave Kashmir and the title of 'Maharaja' to [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 the chief minister \u2014  as a reward for aligning with them against the [[Sikhs]].<ref>Nalwa, V., 2009.

The whole dish is called ''dal puth maani'' and is savoured as a combination. ''Mitha madra'' is a favourite and is cooked from milk, dry fruits, and semolina. Preparations of ''rajmash'' (a special variety of red kidney beans); ''auria'' a dish of curd fermented by rye; ''ambal'' made from pumpkin, jaggery and tamarind are favourites, especially during ceremonial cooking. The expert cooks are called ''Siyans'', usually [[Brahmins]]. ''Kalari'' is a milk preserved by cogulation of proteins and then fried in a pan to make it delicious.\n\nNon-vegetarian food was limited to Rajputs and Vaish (Mahajans). 'Khatta meat' is mutton cooked with sour pomegranate seeds (Anardana) or lime juice and flavoured with fumes of a burning charcoal soaked in mustard oil. Keur is one of the well known foods of Dogras. It is prepared by flour and butter and served with sugar and curd. Mostly, it is served to bridegroom at the time of marriage by the in-laws. Kalaari is a favourite food of Dogras in the rainy season. It is prepared by flour mix, cottage cheese and milk cream (malai) with water with help of a small cup shaped pot. Kalari is served with milk. [[Kalari cheese]] is popular in the Jammu region and in Jammu and Kashmir state more generally. Babbru/pathoru are prepared with flour and fried in mustard oil. Babbru is served with maani/potato/kheer/curd.\n\n[[Kheer]] is a dish prepared from milk by adding some rice and dry fruit in it. It is served at all the special occasions and festivals. Another popular exotic dish is ''guchiyyan'' (dried black [[morel]]), usually added as an ingredient in pulao. As it grows naturally in forests and cannot be cultivated, it is a priced commodity (approx 500 Rs. per 100&nbsp;g) and makes an excelled dish with mountain potatoes (pahadi aloo). [[Saffron]] or kesar is extensively used to flavour sweet dishes and for its anti-oxidant benefits.<ref name=\"dt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.duggartimes.com |title=Index of / |publisher=Duggartimes.com |accessdate=19 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117181654/http://www.duggartimes.com/ |archivedate=17 January 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Military history===\n\nThe [[Dogra Regiment]] was among the regiments of the [[British Indian Army]], which made significant contributions in both the world wars on all fronts from [[East Asia]] to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]].

The inscription mentions the Raja of Chamba facing an attack by Kiras aided by the Lord of Durgara (''durg\u0101re\u015bwara''). In medieval times the term ''Durgar'' is believed to have turned into ''Dugar'', eventually transforming to \"Dogra\". Kalhana's ''[[Rajatarangini]]'' makes no mention of a kingdom by any of these names, but the kingdoms could have been referred to by their capital cities (such as ''Vallapura'', modern [[Billawar]], or ''Babbapura'', modern Babor). In modern times, the term Dogra turned into an ethnic identity, claimed by all those people that speak the [[Dogri language]], irrespective of their religion.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==History==\nScholar Omachanda Handa believes that the Durgara people were originally migrants from Rajasthan to the [[Terai]] belt, similar to the [[Gurjaras]] (or \"Gujjars\"). The allusion to ''durg'' (fort) in their name indicates that they may have remained a warrior people, eventually founding powerful kingdoms between [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and [[Ravi River|Ravi]], and possibly dominating up to the [[Sutlej River|Sutluj]] river.{{sfn|Handa, Textiles, Costumes, and Ornaments of the Western Himalaya|1998|pp=178\u2013180}}\n\nAccording to [[M. A. Stein]], there were some eleven Dogra states in the region, all of which were eventually absorbed into the [[Jammu]] state, which emerged as the most powerful among them.{{sfn|Stein, Kalhana's Rajatarangini|1900|p=432}} Prior to the rise of Jammu, Babbapura (Babor) is expected to have been the chief state of Dogras. Lying 45 km east of Jammu, Babor contains the ruins of six magnificent temples representing a \"thriving artistic activity\".<ref name=\"Saraf1987\">{{citation |last=Saraf |first=D.

The lower Himalayan ranges begin behind the town of Jammu, which rests on a slope over {{convert|1300|ft}} above sea level, overlooking and commanding the plain watered by the [[Chenab]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Tawi River|Tawi]] and [[Ujh River|Ujh]] rivers. The Jammu region consists of ten districts: [[Jammu]], [[Kathua]], [[Udhampur]], [[Doda district|Doda]], [[Poonch (town)|Poonch]], [[Kishtwar]], [[Reasi]], [[Samba, Jammu|Samba]], [[Ramban district|Ramban]] and [[Rajouri]]. The city of Jammu is the winter capital of the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].\n\nThe Jammu Dogras traditionally inhabited the area between the slopes of the [[Sivalik Hills|Shivalik range]] of mountains, the sacred lakes of Saroien sar and Mannsar but later spread over whole of Jammu region. They generally speak Dogri and other dialects similar to Dogri. The majority of the Dogra are followers of [[Hindu]]ism, but a large number in Jammu and Kashmir believe in other religions. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, some Dogras embraced [[Islam]]. These factors, together with the effects of immigration into the region, have resulted in the Dogra population of Jammu and Kashmir including members of all three religions. \n\nThe [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Raj]] emerged as a regional power, particularly after Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] emerged as a warrior and his subjects received special martial recognition from the [[British Raj]]. The rule of Gulab Singh's Raj extended over the whole of the Jammu Region, a large part of the Ladakh region as early as March 1846, and a large part of the Indian Punjab (now [[Himachal Pradesh]]). The [[Kashmir Valley]] was handed over to Gulab Singh by the British government, as part of the territories ceded to the British government by Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the [[Treaty of Lahore]] dated 9{{nbsp}}March 1846. Under the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]] in the same year, the Dogra king of Jammu and the state was thereafter known as the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir State (Raj), also thereafter referred as Kashmir State. The term Dogra hence is more akin to the subjects of Himachal Pradesh, some areas of Punjab and the whole region of Jammu that was ruled by Raja Gulab Singh as part of the Dogra Raj irrespective of the religion of the inhabitants.\n\n===Cultural profile===\n* ''Kud'', a ritual dance performed in honour of Lok Devatas. This dance style is performed mostly at night. It is spontaneous and people of all ages and sexes participate. Instruments used during the Kud are Narshingha, chhaina, flute, drumsm etc. The rhythm of music controls the movement of participants. This dance continues for the whole night. The number of participants ranges from 20 to 30 members.\n* ''Heren'', a traditional theatre form performed during the Lohri festival by 10\u201315 people. It is mostly performed in hilly regions of Jammu, Udhampur and ramnagar.\n* ''Fumenie'' and ''Jagarana'', a dance style performed by women on the eve of groom's departure to in-laws house. Both the songs are sung by a group consisting of 15\u201320 members. This traditional dance form depicts the feelings and emotions of women.\n* ''Bakh/Gwatri/Kark/Masade'', a chorus narrative sung by a group of 10 singers without any musical instruments.\n* ''Gwatri'', a singing\u2013dance combined tradition in which the singers narrate some text which is acted by the Gwatari dancers.\n* ''Karak'', a narrative ballet sung by a community called 'Jogies'. They narrate a popular folk tale in their dance style, performed by three members with accompaniment of a typical folk instrument called 'Rabab'.\n* ''Benthe'', the chorus singing tradition performed specific community of tribal called Gujjar and Bakerwal. The dance is performed by 5\u20137 members.<ref>Govt of J&K Website</ref>\n\n==The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir (Dogra dynasty)==\n{{main|The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir}}\nThe [[Dogra dynasty]] was a dynasty of [[Hindu]] [[Rajputs]] who ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]] from 1846 to 1947. They traced their ancestry to the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvaku]] (Solar) Dynasty of [[Northern India]] (the same clan in which [[Lord Rama]] was born; he, therefore, is the 'kuldevta' (family deity) of the Dogras). \n[[File:Gulabsingh1840.jpg|thumb|[[Gulab Singh]], the first Maharaja of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]], the last monarch of [[Dogra dynasty|Dogra Rajput dynasty]] which ruled [[Jammu & Kashmir]].]]\n\nAmong the enlightened rulers of Jammu was Raja Ranjit Dev (1728\u20131780) who introduced certain social reforms such as a ban on '[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]' (immolation of the wife on the funeral pyre of the husband) and female infanticide. Later, under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], the state became part of the [[Sikh Empire]] of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] after it was captured from its Afghan rulers. Ranjit Singh rendered this state to his general, [[Maharaja Gulab Singh Jamwal]], who belonged to the Jamwal Rajput clan that ruled Jammu. He extended the boundaries of Jammu to western Tibet with the help of General Zorawar Singh. \n\nThe Sikh Empire rule extended beyond the Jammu Region and the [[Kashmir Valley]] to the Tibetan Buddhist Kingdom of [[Ladakh]] and the Emirates of [[State of Hunza|Hunza]], [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] and [[State of Nagar|Nagar]]. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846, the British gave Kashmir and the title of 'Maharaja' to [[Gulab Singh]] \u2014 the chief minister \u2014  as a reward for aligning with them against the [[Sikhs]].<ref>Nalwa, V., 2009.

The whole dish is called ''dal puth maani'' and is savoured as a combination. ''Mitha madra'' is a favourite and is cooked from milk, dry fruits, and semolina. Preparations of ''rajmash'' (a special variety of red kidney beans); ''auria'' a dish of curd fermented by rye; ''ambal'' made from pumpkin, jaggery and tamarind are favourites, especially during ceremonial cooking. The expert cooks are called ''Siyans'', usually [[Brahmins]]. ''Kalari'' is a milk preserved by cogulation of proteins and then fried in a pan to make it delicious.\n\nNon-vegetarian food was limited to Rajputs and Vaish (Mahajans). 'Khatta meat' is mutton cooked with sour pomegranate seeds (Anardana) or lime juice and flavoured with fumes of a burning charcoal soaked in mustard oil. Keur is one of the well known foods of Dogras. It is prepared by flour and butter and served with sugar and curd. Mostly, it is served to bridegroom at the time of marriage by the in-laws. Kalaari is a favourite food of Dogras in the rainy season. It is prepared by flour mix, cottage cheese and milk cream (malai) with water with help of a small cup shaped pot. Kalari is served with milk. [[Kalari cheese]] is popular in the Jammu region and in Jammu and Kashmir state more generally. Babbru/pathoru are prepared with flour and fried in mustard oil. Babbru is served with maani/potato/kheer/curd.\n\n[[Kheer]] is a dish prepared from milk by adding some rice and dry fruit in it. It is served at all the special occasions and festivals. Another popular exotic dish is ''guchiyyan'' (dried black [[morel]]), usually added as an ingredient in pulao. As it grows naturally in forests and cannot be cultivated, it is a priced commodity (approx 500 Rs. per 100&nbsp;g) and makes an excelled dish with mountain potatoes (pahadi aloo). [[Saffron]] or kesar is extensively used to flavour sweet dishes and for its anti-oxidant benefits.<ref name=\"dt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.duggartimes.com |title=Index of / |publisher=Duggartimes.com |accessdate=19 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117181654/http://www.duggartimes.com/ |archivedate=17 January 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Military history===\n\nThe [[Dogra Regiment]] was among the regiments of the [[British Indian Army]], which made significant contributions in both the world wars on all fronts from [[East Asia]] to [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]].

With the decline of coal traffic and the closure of the Bute Docks, it now sees only passenger services, and is regarded as a branch from the line through to {{rws|Cardiff Central}}.\n\nAt privatisation in 1995, services were operated by the Cardiff Railway Company, which traded as [[Valley Lines (train operating company)|Valley Lines]].  This was subsumed by the new [[Wales & Borders]] franchise in 2001, which was subsequently awarded to [[Arriva UK Trains]] in December 2003 and operated as [[Arriva Trains Wales]]. In October 2018, [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] took over the franchise from Arriva Trains Wales.\n\nThe December 2005 timetable introduced a further increase in services to 4 trains per hour 18 hours a day, and even a Sunday service for the first time (further improved in June 2006 to offer the same 4 trains per hour service from 11am to 4pm). In December 2005, Arriva employed a single car [[British Rail Class 153|Class 153]] to \"shuttle\" along the Butetown Line, upgrading from the 2 car [[British Rail Class 143|Class 143]] 'Pacers' used for the service. Since then, the service frequency has been increased even more \u2013 there are now 5 trains per hour on the line every day of the week, which equates to one train every 12 minutes.\n\nIn July 2006 the service was due to be provided by a 1950s {{BRC|121}} \"Bubble car\" DMU.

During this period of living apart, Bridget's independence grew, with her keeping her own flock of chickens and selling the eggs to neighbours. Somewhat unusually for the era and location, she was also a professional woman. She obtained a [[Singer sewing machine]], state of the art at the time, and was variously described as a dressmaker and a [[Hatmaking|milliner]]. Despite their eight years of marriage, the couple had had no children by the time of Bridget's death. Following the death of Bridget's mother, the Clearys found themselves responsible for Bridget's elderly father, Patrick Boland. His residence with the couple enabled them to secure a house reserved for labourers. Neither Bridget nor Michael was entitled to this cottage, but as Patrick had been a labourer in his youth, they were able to acquire the best house in the village. However, there was no widespread interest in the house, as it was built on the site of a supposed [[Fairy fort|fairy ringfort]].<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\n==\"Disappearance\"==\nBridget was reported missing in March 1895. She had evidently been ill for several days; her diagnosis was said to be bronchitis. More than a week into her illness, on 13 March 1895, a physician visited her at her home; her condition was considered sufficiently grave that a priest soon followed, to administer [[last rites]]. Several of her friends and family members attended her over the next two days, and a number of home remedies were administered, including one ritual that anticipated her later demise: her father and her husband accused her of being a fairy sent to take Bridget's place. Urine was thrown on her, and she was carried before the fireplace to cast the fairy out.\n\nBy 16 March, rumours were beginning to circulate that Bridget was missing, and the local police began searching for her. Michael was quoted as claiming that his wife had been taken by fairies, and he appeared to be holding a vigil. Witness statements were gathered over the ensuing week, and by the time Bridget Cleary's burnt corpse was found in a shallow grave on 22 March, nine people had been charged in her disappearance, including her husband. A coroner's inquest the next day returned a verdict of death by burning.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Trial==\nLegal hearings ran from 1 April to 6 April 1895. A tenth person had been charged, and one of the original nine was discharged at this stage, leaving nine defendants bound over for trial. The court session began on 3 July, and the [[grand jury]] indicted five of the defendants for murder: Michael Cleary, Patrick Boland, Mary  Kennedy, James Kennedy, and Patrick Kennedy. All nine were indicted on charges of \"wounding.\"{{Clarify|date=October 2013}} The case proceeded on to trial. The evidence showed that on 15 March, Michael summoned Father Ryan back to the Cleary household. Ryan found Bridget alive but agitated. Michael Cleary told the priest that he had not been giving his wife the medicine prescribed by the doctor, because he had no faith in it. According to Ryan, \"Cleary then said, 'People may have some remedy of their own that might do more good than doctor's medicine,' or something to that effect.\" Bridget was given communion, and Ryan departed. Later that night, neighbours and relatives returned to the Cleary house. An argument ensued, again tinged with fairy mythology. {{Clarify|date=May 2013}}\n\nAt some point, Bridget told Michael that the only person who'd gone off with the fairies had been his mother. Michael attempted to force-feed his wife, throwing her down on the ground before the kitchen fireplace and menacing her with a burning piece of wood. Bridget's [[chemise]] caught fire, and Michael then threw lamp oil (kerosene) on Bridget. The witnesses were unclear as to whether she was already dead by this point. Michael kept the others back from her body as it burned, insisting that she was a changeling and had been for a week previously, and that he would get his wife back from the fairies.<ref name=\"burning231\" />\n\nAs part of the trial, the jury was actually led out to the storage building where Bridget's body was being held for burial, and where it was available for viewing. The jury were given the opportunity to see the condition of the body and the extent of her injuries, as well as to personally verify that the body was indeed Bridget's by looking upon her face. What the jury witnessed in the outbuilding convinced them of the horrible suffering Bridget had endured prior to death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Burning of Bridget Cleary: A True Story|last=Bourke|first=Angela|publisher=Penguin Group USA|date=1 July 2001|isbn=978-0-14-100202-6|location=|pages=132|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nCharges against one  co-defendants, William Ahearn, were dropped, and three others, John Dunne, Michael Kennedy, and William Kennedy, were convicted of \"wounding\".<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D91E3AF93BA35753C1A9669C8B63 David Willis McCullough, \"The Fairy Defense\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 October 2000; accessed 23 March 2007.</ref>  Patrick Kennedy was sentenced to 5 years of penal servitude, Michael Kennedy was sentenced to 6 months of hard labor, James Kennedy was sentenced to 18 months of hard labor, William Kennedy was sentenced to 18 months of hard labor, Mary Kennedy was released owing to her age and frailty, Patrick Boland was sentenced to 6 months of hard labor, John Dunne was sentenced to 3 years of penal servitude, and Michael Cleary was found guilty of [[manslaughter]], and sentenced to 20 years of penal servitude; he spent 15 years in prison.

O\u2019Connell and P. G. Doyle (2006) speculated that the murder may have been the result of Michael Cleary developing a [[brief psychotic disorder]], which manifested as [[Capgras syndrome]], due to the stress of managing Bridget's illness. This became a case of ''[[folie \u00e0 plusieurs]]'' after he persuaded others that she had been replaced by a fairy. The possibility that others complicit in the murder suffered from [[learning disabilities]] that allowed them to become convinced of the delusion's veracity was also raised.<ref>O\u2019Connell, H., & Doyle, P.

It is evident that Bridget was a very successful businesswoman, a rare thing in rural communities of this era. His demasculation as a result of this may have to contributed to his ease at coming to believe his wife had been replaced.\n\n==In popular culture==\nAn Irish nursery rhyme reads, \"Are you a witch, or are you a fairy/Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary?\"\n\n''The Burning of Bridget Cleary'' by Angela Bourke and ''The Cooper's Wife is Missing'' by Joan Hoff & Marian Yeates, both released independently of each other in 2000, are historical accounts of the case that attempt to contextualize the murder with the belief in fairies in Ireland during the period.\n\nIn 2010, ''The Fairy Wife'', a play by Lawrence Bullock, based on the life of Bridget Cleary, premiered in New York City, at the Producers' Club Theatre, under the auspices of Le Wilhelm and Love Creek Productions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nEpisode 85 of [[The Irish History Podcast]], broadcast July 11, 2016, gives a detailed account of Bridget Cleary's murder, entitled \"Bridget Cleary - the last woman burned alive in Ireland.\"\n\nThe 2016 song \"Changeling\" by The Riptide Movement is based on the story of Bridget's death.\n\nThe critically acclaimed podcast ''[[Lore (podcast)|Lore]]'' devoted one of its episodes (entitled \"Black Stockings\", broadcast October 13, 2017) to the story of Bridget Cleary's murder. The podcast has since spawned a TV adaption produced and aired by [[Amazon Video]]. The \"Black Stockings\" story was one of the six podcast episodes chosen to be adapted for the TV series.

O\u2019Connell and P. G. Doyle (2006) speculated that the murder may have been the result of Michael Cleary developing a [[brief psychotic disorder]], which manifested as [[Capgras syndrome]], due to the stress of managing Bridget's illness. This became a case of ''[[folie \u00e0 plusieurs]]'' after he persuaded others that she had been replaced by a fairy. The possibility that others complicit in the murder suffered from [[learning disabilities]] that allowed them to become convinced of the delusion's veracity was also raised.<ref>O\u2019Connell, H., & Doyle, P.

The podcast has since spawned a TV adaption produced and aired by [[Amazon Video]]. The \"Black Stockings\" story was one of the six podcast episodes chosen to be adapted for the TV series. The role of Bridget Cleary was portrayed by [[Holland Roden]], while the role of her husband Michael was portrayed by [[Cathal Pendred]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2017/05/lore-holland-roden-lead-amazon-horror-anthology-series-1202105247/ |title=''Lore'': Holland Roden set as lead in Amazon horror anthology series |author=Denise Petski |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=31 May 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{IMDb episode|6967582|Black Stockings}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, ''Porcelain'', a play by Margaret Perry, uses the real-life tragedy of Bridget Cleary as a harrowing backdrop to a modern-day thriller. ''Porcelain'' weaves past and present, myth and fact to explore the parallel stories of two Irish women. It opens in Dublin's [[Abbey Theatre]].<ref>{{ |url=https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats-on/porcelain/ |title=''Porcelain'' |date=6 January 2018  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Irish singer-songwriter [[Maija Sofia]] released the song, 'The Wife of Michael Cleary', about the tragic story.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Capgras delusion]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bourke, Angela.
