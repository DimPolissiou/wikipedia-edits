It was released on October 30, 2015 by [[Republic Records]], and was originally intended to be the opening track as well as the lead single off Grande's third studio album, ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' (then called ''Moonlight''). \"[[Dangerous Woman (song)|Dangerous Woman]]\" replaced it as the lead single, and the song was later scrapped from the standard-edition track listing, however it was included as a bonus track on the album's Japanese version. The song was written by Grande, [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Peter Svensson]] and its producers, [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]] and [[Max Martin]]. \"Focus\" features [[horn (instrument)|horns]] ([[saxophone]], [[trumpet]] and [[trombone]]), with cowbells and handclaps as percussion.\n\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Some praised Grande's vocals and the song's brassy production, and others criticized its similarity to her 2014 song \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\". \"Focus\" debuted at number seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with 113,000 downloads in its first week. It was Grande's sixth top-ten single, and her first unaccompanied by another artist. The song also reached the top ten in Canada, Australia, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. By January 2016, \"Focus\" sold 544,000 copies in the United States and was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\nIts music video, directed by [[Hannah Lux Davis]], premiered on October 30, 2015 on Grande's [[Vevo]] channel. She performed \"Focus\" at the November 22 [[2015 American Music Awards]] and at the [[iHeartRadio]] Theater Los Angeles concert, and it was on the set list of the second leg of Grande's 2017 [[Dangerous Woman Tour]].\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Focus\" was written by Grande, [[Savan Kotecha]], Peter Svensson and its producers, [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]] and [[Max Martin]].<ref name=\"credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/focus-mw0002894390/credits|title=Focus &#91;Single&#93;|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

It was released on October 30, 2015 by [[Republic Records]], and was originally intended to be the opening track as well as the lead single off Grande's third studio album, ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' (then called ''Moonlight''). \"[[Dangerous Woman (song)|Dangerous Woman]]\" replaced it as the lead single, and the song was later scrapped from the standard-edition track listing, however it was included as a bonus track on the album's Japanese version. The song was written by Grande, [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Peter Svensson]] and its producers, [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]] and [[Max Martin]]. \"Focus\" features [[horn (instrument)|horns]] ([[saxophone]], [[trumpet]] and [[trombone]]), with cowbells and handclaps as percussion.\n\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Some praised Grande's vocals and the song's brassy production, and others criticized its similarity to her 2014 song \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\". \"Focus\" debuted at number seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with 113,000 downloads in its first week. It was Grande's sixth top-ten single, and her first unaccompanied by another artist. The song also reached the top ten in Canada, Australia, Greece, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. By January 2016, \"Focus\" sold 544,000 copies in the United States and was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\nIts music video, directed by [[Hannah Lux Davis]], premiered on October 30, 2015 on Grande's [[Vevo]] channel. She performed \"Focus\" at the November 22 [[2015 American Music Awards]] and at the [[iHeartRadio]] Theater Los Angeles concert, and it was on the set list of the second leg of Grande's 2017 [[Dangerous Woman Tour]].\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Focus\" was written by Grande, [[Savan Kotecha]], Peter Svensson and its producers, [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]] and [[Max Martin]].<ref name=\"credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/focus-mw0002894390/credits|title=Focus &#91;Single&#93;|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

It hosts the [[Danville Braves]] baseball club of the [[Appalachian League]].\n\n[[File:View of the Dan River Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Dan River in downtown Danville]]\n\n==History==\nNumerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes had lived in this part of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region since prehistoric times. During the colonial period, the area was inhabited by [[Siouan language]]-speaking tribes.\n\nIn 1728, English colonist [[William Byrd II|William Byrd]] headed an expedition sent to determine the true boundary between Virginia and [[North Carolina]]. Late that summer, the party camped upstream from what is now Danville. Byrd was so taken with the beauty of the land, that he prophesied a future settlement in the vicinity, where people would live \"with much comfort and gaiety of Heart.\" He named the river along which they camped as the \"[[Dan River|Dan]]\", for Byrd felt he had wandered \"[[From Dan to Beersheba]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://danvillehistory.org/history.html|title=History|website=Danville Historical Society|language=en|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, the first settlement developed in 1792 downstream from Byrd's campsite, at a spot along the river shallow enough to allow fording. It was named \"Wynne's Falls\", after the first settler. The village developed from the meetings of pioneering [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veterans, who gathered annually here to fish and talk over old times.\n\nIn 1793, the state General Assembly authorized construction of a tobacco warehouse at Wynne's Falls. This marks the start of the town as \"The World's Best Tobacco Market\", Virginia's largest market for \"[[bright leaf]]\" tobacco. The village was renamed \"Danville\" by an act of November 23, 1793. A charter for the town was drawn up February 17, 1830, but by the time of its issue, the population had exceeded the pre-arranged boundaries. This necessitated a new charter, which was issued in 1833. In that year, James Lanier was elected the first mayor, assisted by a council of \"twelve fit and able men\". By the mid-19th century, [[William T. Sutherlin]], a planter and entrepreneur, was the first to apply water power to run a tobacco press. He became a major industrialist in the region.\n\nSeveral railroads reached Danville, including the [[Richmond and Danville Railroad]] (completed 1856), and the [[Atlantic and Danville Railway]] (completed 1890). These enabled the export of Danville's manufacturing and agricultural products. The major growth in industry came in the late 19th century, after the war. The [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]], successor to the Richmond and Danville, built a grand passenger station in Danville in 1899, which is still in use by Amtrak and is a satellite facility of the Virginia Museum.\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:William T Sutherlin Mansion Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|left|Danville home of tobacco entrepreneur [[William T. Sutherlin]], called by locals the \"Last Capitol of the Confederacy\"]]\n[[File:Jefferson Davis Fall of Richmond Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Broadside by President [[Jefferson Davis]] announcing move of Confederate capitol to Danville, 4 April 1865]]\n[[File:Planters' Warehouse Danville Virginia.jpeg|thumb|right|160px|Broadside advertisement for tobacco warehouse, Danville, 1874]]\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Danville had a population of some 5,000 people. During those four years of war, the town was transformed into a strategic center of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] activity. Local planter and industrialist [[William T. Sutherlin]] was named [[quartermaster]] of its depot, the rail center was critical for supplying Confederate forces, and a hospital station was established for Confederate wounded.  A network of batteries, breastworks, redoubts and rifle pits defended the town.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nA prison camp was set up, with the conversion of six tobacco warehouses, including one owned by Sutherlin, for use as prisons. At one time they held more than 5,000 captured [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] soldiers. [[Malnutrition]] and [[dysentery]], plus a [[smallpox]] epidemic in 1864, caused the death of 1,314 of these prisoners. Their remains have been interred in the [[Danville National Cemetery (Virginia)|Danville National Cemetery]].\n\nThe [[Richmond and Danville Railroad]] was the main supply route into [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], where Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]] was [[Siege of Petersburg|holding the defensive]] line to protect [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. The Danville supply train ran until General [[George Stoneman|Stoneman's]] Union cavalry troops tore up the tracks. This event was immortalized in the song, \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\".\n\nIn 1865 Danville hosted the Confederate government. President [[Jefferson Davis]] stayed at the mansion of [[William T. Sutherlin]] from April 3 to 10, 1865, and it became known as the last \"Capitol of the Confederacy\".<ref name=\"arcadia\">{{cite book|author1=Frankie Y. Bailey|author2=Alice P.

The final Confederate Cabinet meeting was held at the Benedict House (since destroyed) in Danville. Davis and members of his cabinet left the city when they learned of Lee's [[surrender at Appomattox]], and moved to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], making their way south. On the day they left, Governor [[William Smith (Virginia governor)|William Smith]] arrived from [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] to establish his headquarters here.\n\n===Post-Reconstruction era to early 20th century===\n[[File:Dan's Hill Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|Dan's Hill estate, far western Danville]]\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tobacco processing was a major source of wealth for business owners in the city, in addition to the textile mills. Wealthy planters and owners built fine houses, some of which have been preserved.\n\nGiven the falls on the river, the area was prime for industrial development based on water power. On July 22, 1882, six of Danville's residents (Thomas Benton Fitzgerald, Dr. H.W. Cole, Benjamin F. Jefferson and three brothers: Robert A., John H., and James E. Schoolfield) founded the Riverside Cotton Mills, making use of cotton produced throughout the South. In its day it was known nationally as [[Dan River Inc. Riverside Division Historic District|Dan River Inc.]], the largest single-unit [[textile mill]] in the world.\n\n[[Image:Old 97 wreck at Stillhouse Trestle in Virginia - 1903 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Wreck of the Old 97, 1903]]\nThe [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] constructed a railroad line to the city in the late 19th century and had facilities here, which contributed to the growing economy. In 1899 the company completed a grand passenger station, designed by its noted architect [[Frank Pierce Milburn]]. For many years, passenger traffic was strong on the railroad; it also operated freight trains.\n\nA serious train wreck occurred in Danville one September 27, 1903. \"Old 97\", the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Southern Railway]]'s crack express mail train, was running behind schedule. Its engineer \"gave her full throttle\", but the speed of the train caused it to jump the tracks while on a high trestle crossing the valley of the Dan River. The engine and five cars plunged into the ravine below, killing nine and injuring seven. The locomotive and its engineer, Joseph A. (\"Steve\") Broadey, were memorialized in song. A historic marker at the train crash site is located on U.S. 58 between Locust Lane and North Main Street. A mural of the ''[[Wreck of the Old 97]]'' has been painted on a downtown Danville building to commemorate the incident.\n\n====Danville riot====\nThe industrial town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, attracting many single workers, and associated gambling, drinking, and prostitution establishments. It was a rough place. By the early 20th century, the city passed laws against gambling, but it continued in small, private places.<ref name=\"arcadia\"/>  On September 9, 1882, Danville mayor John H. Johnston shot and killed John E. Hatcher, his chief of police. Hatcher had demanded an apology for a statement Johnston had made regarding unaccounted fine money. Johnston was charged with murder, but he was acquitted at trial. The Southern \"culture of honor\" was still strong and jurors apparently believed the killing was justified.<ref>{{cite web | title = John Epps Hatcher | publisher = Hatcher Families Genealogy Society | url = http://hatcherfamilyassn.com/getperson.php?personID=I28032&tree=WmTheIm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882 the biracial [[Readjuster Party]] had gained control of the city council, causing alarm and resentment among some white residents, even though the council was still dominated by white members. The Readjuster Party had been in power at the state level since 1879. Social tensions had been rising in the city, which then had a majority African-American population. What is called the [[Danville Riot]] took place on November 3, 1883, a few days before the election, when a racially-motivated street fight turned to shooting as a large crowd gathered; five men were killed, four of them black. A local Danville commission found African Americans at fault for the violence on November 3, but a US Senate investigation decided that white residents were to blame. No prosecution resulted from either inquiry.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n|contribution=Danville Riot (1883)\n|first=Brendan\n|last=Wolfe\n|title=Encyclopedia Virginia\n|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Danville_Riot_1883#itsFR\n|year=2015\n|publisher=[[Virginia Humanities]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|title=The Press on the Danville Riot\n|newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch|Richmond Dispatch]]\n|date=November 6, 1883\n|url=https://staging.encyclopediavirginia.org/_The_Press_on_the_Danville_Riot_Richmond_Dispatch_November_6_1883}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bryan Stephenson|Equal Justice Institute]] included the deaths in the Danville Riot in its 2015 report of lynchings in the South from 1877 to 1950. There were five lynchings in Danville, the second highest total of any independent city or county in the state.<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005306/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf |date=2018-06-27 }}, Supplement by County, p. 7</ref> (The highest was [[Tazewell County, Virginia|Tazewell]].)\n\nAfterward Democrats forced African Americans out of office and suppressed their voting. In November 1883 Democrats regained control of the state legislature by a large majority, and pushed out the Readjuster Party.\n\nWhite Democratic legislators interpreted the Danville events as more reason to push blacks out of politics. In 1902 the state legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks]] and many poor whites, who had been part of the Readjuster Party. They excluded them from the political system, causing them to be underrepresented and their segregated facilities to be underfinanced.<ref name=\"vaenc\">[https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Disfranchisement#its2 Brent Tarter, \"Post-Reconstruction Suffrage and following sections\"], ''Disfranchisement'', Encyclopedia of Virginia, 19 July 2016; accessed 17 March 2018</ref>\n\n====Another lynching, and a lynching prevented====\nOn July 15, 1904, the Danville police successfully broke up a lynching party by firing warning shots above a crowd. About 75 white men had gathered at the jail to take Roy Seals, an African-American man arrested as a suspect in the murder of a white railroad worker. The police saved Seals and the city quickly indicted some of the lynch mob; several men were convicted, fined and served 30 days in jail. The killer was found to have been another white man, who was prosecuted.<ref name=\"arcadia\"/>\n\nOn March 2, 1911, Danville Police Chief R. E. Morris, who had been elected to three two-year terms and was running for a fourth term, was arrested as an escaped convicted murderer. He admitted that he was really Edgar Stribling of [[Harris County, Georgia]]. He had been on the run for thirteen years.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/03/03/105022523.pdf \"Arrest Police Chief as Escaped Convict\"], ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1911. Retrieved January 10, 2008.</ref>\n\nOn October 13, 1917, Walter Clark was lynched. He was an African-American man who had fatally shot a policeman while resisting arrest for the killing of his common-law wife. Clark held off the police for two hours, but a mob gathered and set his house on fire. He was shot multiple times and killed as he left the house. His was the last lynching in Danville.<ref name=\"arcadia\"/>\n\n===Civil Rights Movement===\n{{main|Bloody Monday (Danville)}}\nHeightened activism in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in Virginia occurred in Danville during the summer of 1963. Since the early 20th century, most blacks had been excluded from voting by the state constitution, which had created barriers to voter registration. White Democrats had imposed legal segregation after regaining control of the state legislature following the [[Reconstruction Era]], and [[Jim Crow laws]] maintained [[white supremacy]]. On May 31, representatives of the black community organized as the Danville Christian Progressive Association (DCPA), demanding an end to segregation and job discrimination in the city. They declared a boycott of white merchants who refused to hire blacks and marched to City Hall in protest of conditions.\n\nMost of the marchers were high school students. Police and city workers, armed with clubs, beat the young protesters and sprayed them with fire hoses.

They helped lead protests, including demonstrations at the [[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson Hotel]] and restaurant on Lee Highway. The hotel was known for discriminating locally against blacks as customers and excluding them as workers. A special grand jury indicted 13 DCPA, [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], and SNCC activists for violating the \"John Brown\" law. This law, passed in 1830 after a slave uprising, made it a serious felony to \"...incite the colored population to acts of violence or war against the white population.\" It became known as the \"John Brown\" law in 1860 because it was used to convict and hang abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] after his raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] in 1859.<ref name=CRMV/>\n\nBy the end of August, more than 600 protesters had been arrested in Danville on charges of inciting to violence, contempt, trespassing, disorderly conduct, assault, parading without a permit, and resisting arrest. Because of the large number of arrests on these charges, often the jails were overcrowded, and protesters were housed in detention facilities in other nearby jurisdictions. The demonstrations failed to achieve desegregation in Danville at that time. Town facilities remained segregated until after passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. African-American residents were mostly unable to register and vote until after the federal government enforced their constitutional rights under the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref name=CRMV/>\n\n===Late 20th century to present===\n[[File:Shuttered textile mill Dan River Mills Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|right|Abandoned Dan River Mills on the [[Dan River]]]]\nSince the late 20th century, the textile industry has moved to offshore, cheaper labor markets. The Dan River mill has closed and many of its buildings have been torn down, with the bricks sold for other uses. \"The White Mill\" of the Dan Mill complex, considered historically and architecturally significant, is being renovated in the early 21st century as an apartment complex.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the restructuring of the tobacco, textile, and railroad industries all had an adverse effect, resulting in the loss of many jobs in Danville. The decline in passenger traffic caused the Danville station to fall into disuse. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995, and has been renovated by a combination of public and private funding. Today its transportation center serves Amtrak passengers, with part of the station devoted to the first satellite facility of the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. Related spaces have been developed for a park with amphitheater, a community meeting and recreation facility, and the [http://www.danville-va.gov/index.aspx?NID=532 Danville Farmer's Market].  The city used ISTEA funds in association with the Virginia Department of Transportation, and partnered also with Amtrak, Pepsi-Cola, and other private sources. The station renovations were completed in 1996. This project spurred investment in other warehouse properties, \"which have been redeveloped into offices, commercial spaces, apartments, lofts, and restaurants. The approximately $4 million of federal grant money initiated the redevelopment and leveraged additional funds from public and private sources.\"<ref name=\"danstation\">[http://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/danville-va-dan/ \"Danville, VA (DAN)\"], The Great American Stations, 2013\u20132018, Amtrak; accessed 17 March 2018</ref>\n\nThe city and region continue to work to develop new bases for the economy. The losses have made it difficult to preserve the city's many architecturally and historically significant properties dating from its more prosperous years. In 2007 [[Preservation Virginia]] President William B. Kerkam, III, and its Executive Director Elizabeth S. Kostelny announced at a press conference held in Danville at Main Street Methodist Church that the entire city of Danville had been named as one of the Most Endangered Historic Sites in Virginia.

It hosts the [[Danville Braves]] baseball club of the [[Appalachian League]].\n\n[[File:View of the Dan River Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Dan River in downtown Danville]]\n\n==History==\nNumerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes had lived in this part of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region since prehistoric times. During the colonial period, the area was inhabited by [[Siouan language]]-speaking tribes.\n\nIn 1728, English colonist [[William Byrd II|William Byrd]] headed an expedition sent to determine the true boundary between Virginia and [[North Carolina]]. Late that summer, the party camped upstream from what is now Danville. Byrd was so taken with the beauty of the land, that he prophesied a future settlement in the vicinity, where people would live \"with much comfort and gaiety of Heart.\" He named the river along which they camped as the \"[[Dan River|Dan]]\", for Byrd felt he had wandered \"[[From Dan to Beersheba]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://danvillehistory.org/history.html|title=History|website=Danville Historical Society|language=en|access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, the first settlement developed in 1792 downstream from Byrd's campsite, at a spot along the river shallow enough to allow fording. It was named \"Wynne's Falls\", after the first settler. The village developed from the meetings of pioneering [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veterans, who gathered annually here to fish and talk over old times.\n\nIn 1793, the state General Assembly authorized construction of a tobacco warehouse at Wynne's Falls. This marks the start of the town as \"The World's Best Tobacco Market\", Virginia's largest market for \"[[bright leaf]]\" tobacco. The village was renamed \"Danville\" by an act of November 23, 1793. A charter for the town was drawn up February 17, 1830, but by the time of its issue, the population had exceeded the pre-arranged boundaries. This necessitated a new charter, which was issued in 1833. In that year, James Lanier was elected the first mayor, assisted by a council of \"twelve fit and able men\". By the mid-19th century, [[William T. Sutherlin]], a planter and entrepreneur, was the first to apply water power to run a tobacco press. He became a major industrialist in the region.\n\nSeveral railroads reached Danville, including the [[Richmond and Danville Railroad]] (completed 1856), and the [[Atlantic and Danville Railway]] (completed 1890). These enabled the export of Danville's manufacturing and agricultural products. The major growth in industry came in the late 19th century, after the war. The [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]], successor to the Richmond and Danville, built a grand passenger station in Danville in 1899, which is still in use by Amtrak and is a satellite facility of the Virginia Museum.\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:William T Sutherlin Mansion Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|left|Danville home of tobacco entrepreneur [[William T. Sutherlin]], called by locals the \"Last Capitol of the Confederacy\"]]\n[[File:Jefferson Davis Fall of Richmond Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Broadside by President [[Jefferson Davis]] announcing move of Confederate capitol to Danville, 4 April 1865]]\n[[File:Planters' Warehouse Danville Virginia.jpeg|thumb|right|160px|Broadside advertisement for tobacco warehouse, Danville, 1874]]\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Danville had a population of some 5,000 people. During those four years of war, the town was transformed into a strategic center of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] activity. Local planter and industrialist [[William T. Sutherlin]] was named [[quartermaster]] of its depot, the rail center was critical for supplying Confederate forces, and a hospital station was established for Confederate wounded.  A network of batteries, breastworks, redoubts and rifle pits defended the town.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nA prison camp was set up, with the conversion of six tobacco warehouses, including one owned by Sutherlin, for use as prisons. At one time they held more than 5,000 captured [[Union (American Civil War)|Federal]] soldiers. [[Malnutrition]] and [[dysentery]], plus a [[smallpox]] epidemic in 1864, caused the death of 1,314 of these prisoners. Their remains have been interred in the [[Danville National Cemetery (Virginia)|Danville National Cemetery]].\n\nThe [[Richmond and Danville Railroad]] was the main supply route into [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], where Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]] was [[Siege of Petersburg|holding the defensive]] line to protect [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. The Danville supply train ran until General [[George Stoneman|Stoneman's]] Union cavalry troops tore up the tracks. This event was immortalized in the song, \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\".\n\nIn 1865 Danville hosted the Confederate government. President [[Jefferson Davis]] stayed at the mansion of [[William T. Sutherlin]] from April 3 to 10, 1865, and it became known as the last \"Capitol of the Confederacy\".<ref name=\"arcadia\">{{cite book|author1=Frankie Y. Bailey|author2=Alice P.

The final Confederate Cabinet meeting was held at the Benedict House (since destroyed) in Danville. Davis and members of his cabinet left the city when they learned of Lee's [[surrender at Appomattox]], and moved to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], making their way south. On the day they left, Governor [[William Smith (Virginia governor)|William Smith]] arrived from [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] to establish his headquarters here.\n\n===Post-Reconstruction era to early 20th century===\n[[File:Dan's Hill Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|Dan's Hill estate, far western Danville]]\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tobacco processing was a major source of wealth for business owners in the city, in addition to the textile mills. Wealthy planters and owners built fine houses, some of which have been preserved.\n\nGiven the falls on the river, the area was prime for industrial development based on water power. On July 22, 1882, six of Danville's residents (Thomas Benton Fitzgerald, Dr. H.W. Cole, Benjamin F. Jefferson and three brothers: Robert A., John H., and James E. Schoolfield) founded the Riverside Cotton Mills, making use of cotton produced throughout the South. In its day it was known nationally as [[Dan River Inc. Riverside Division Historic District|Dan River Inc.]], the largest single-unit [[textile mill]] in the world.\n\n[[Image:Old 97 wreck at Stillhouse Trestle in Virginia - 1903 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Wreck of the Old 97, 1903]]\nThe [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]] constructed a railroad line to the city in the late 19th century and had facilities here, which contributed to the growing economy. In 1899 the company completed a grand passenger station, designed by its noted architect [[Frank Pierce Milburn]]. For many years, passenger traffic was strong on the railroad; it also operated freight trains.\n\nA serious train wreck occurred in Danville one September 27, 1903. \"Old 97\", the [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Southern Railway]]'s crack express mail train, was running behind schedule. Its engineer \"gave her full throttle\", but the speed of the train caused it to jump the tracks while on a high trestle crossing the valley of the Dan River. The engine and five cars plunged into the ravine below, killing nine and injuring seven. The locomotive and its engineer, Joseph A. (\"Steve\") Broadey, were memorialized in song. A historic marker at the train crash site is located on U.S. 58 between Locust Lane and North Main Street. A mural of the ''[[Wreck of the Old 97]]'' has been painted on a downtown Danville building to commemorate the incident.\n\n====Danville riot====\nThe industrial town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, attracting many single workers, and associated gambling, drinking, and prostitution establishments. It was a rough place. By the early 20th century, the city passed laws against gambling, but it continued in small, private places.<ref name=\"arcadia\"/>  On September 9, 1882, Danville mayor John H. Johnston shot and killed John E. Hatcher, his chief of police. Hatcher had demanded an apology for a statement Johnston had made regarding unaccounted fine money. Johnston was charged with murder, but he was acquitted at trial. The Southern \"culture of honor\" was still strong and jurors apparently believed the killing was justified.<ref>{{cite web | title = John Epps Hatcher | publisher = Hatcher Families Genealogy Society | url = http://hatcherfamilyassn.com/getperson.php?personID=I28032&tree=WmTheIm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882 the biracial [[Readjuster Party]] had gained control of the city council, causing alarm and resentment among some white residents, even though the council was still dominated by white members. The Readjuster Party had been in power at the state level since 1879. Social tensions had been rising in the city, which then had a majority African-American population. What is called the [[Danville Riot]] took place on November 3, 1883, a few days before the election, when a racially-motivated street fight turned to shooting as a large crowd gathered; five men were killed, four of them black. A local Danville commission found African Americans at fault for the violence on November 3, but a US Senate investigation decided that white residents were to blame. No prosecution resulted from either inquiry.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n|contribution=Danville Riot (1883)\n|first=Brendan\n|last=Wolfe\n|title=Encyclopedia Virginia\n|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Danville_Riot_1883#itsFR\n|year=2015\n|publisher=[[Virginia Humanities]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|title=The Press on the Danville Riot\n|newspaper=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch|Richmond Dispatch]]\n|date=November 6, 1883\n|url=https://staging.encyclopediavirginia.org/_The_Press_on_the_Danville_Riot_Richmond_Dispatch_November_6_1883}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bryan Stephenson|Equal Justice Institute]] included the deaths in the Danville Riot in its 2015 report of lynchings in the South from 1877 to 1950. There were five lynchings in Danville, the second highest total of any independent city or county in the state.<ref name=\"eji\">[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf ''Lynching in America'', 2nd edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005306/https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-second-edition-supplement-by-county.pdf |date=2018-06-27 }}, Supplement by County, p. 7</ref> (The highest was [[Tazewell County, Virginia|Tazewell]].)\n\nAfterward Democrats forced African Americans out of office and suppressed their voting. In November 1883 Democrats regained control of the state legislature by a large majority, and pushed out the Readjuster Party.\n\nWhite Democratic legislators interpreted the Danville events as more reason to push blacks out of politics. In 1902 the state legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks]] and many poor whites, who had been part of the Readjuster Party. They excluded them from the political system, causing them to be underrepresented and their segregated facilities to be underfinanced.<ref name=\"vaenc\">[https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Disfranchisement#its2 Brent Tarter, \"Post-Reconstruction Suffrage and following sections\"], ''Disfranchisement'', Encyclopedia of Virginia, 19 July 2016; accessed 17 March 2018</ref>\n\n====Another lynching, and a lynching prevented====\nOn July 15, 1904, the Danville police successfully broke up a lynching party by firing warning shots above a crowd. About 75 white men had gathered at the jail to take Roy Seals, an African-American man arrested as a suspect in the murder of a white railroad worker. The police saved Seals and the city quickly indicted some of the lynch mob; several men were convicted, fined and served 30 days in jail. The killer was found to have been another white man, who was prosecuted.<ref name=\"arcadia\"/>\n\nOn March 2, 1911, Danville Police Chief R. E. Morris, who had been elected to three two-year terms and was running for a fourth term, was arrested as an escaped convicted murderer. He admitted that he was really Edgar Stribling of [[Harris County, Georgia]]. He had been on the run for thirteen years.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/03/03/105022523.pdf \"Arrest Police Chief as Escaped Convict\"], ''The New York Times'', March 3, 1911. Retrieved January 10, 2008.</ref>\n\nOn October 13, 1917, Walter Clark was lynched. He was an African-American man who had fatally shot a policeman while resisting arrest for the killing of his common-law wife. Clark held off the police for two hours, but a mob gathered and set his house on fire. He was shot multiple times and killed as he left the house. His was the last lynching in Danville.<ref name=\"arcadia\"/>\n\n===Civil Rights Movement===\n{{main|Bloody Monday (Danville)}}\nHeightened activism in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in Virginia occurred in Danville during the summer of 1963. Since the early 20th century, most blacks had been excluded from voting by the state constitution, which had created barriers to voter registration. White Democrats had imposed legal segregation after regaining control of the state legislature following the [[Reconstruction Era]], and [[Jim Crow laws]] maintained [[white supremacy]]. On May 31, representatives of the black community organized as the Danville Christian Progressive Association (DCPA), demanding an end to segregation and job discrimination in the city. They declared a boycott of white merchants who refused to hire blacks and marched to City Hall in protest of conditions.\n\nMost of the marchers were high school students. Police and city workers, armed with clubs, beat the young protesters and sprayed them with fire hoses. Around forty protesters needed medical attention, but the marches and other protests continued for several weeks.<ref name=CRMV>{{cite news|last = Civil Rights Movement Veterans| title = Danville VA, Movement| url = http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963danville}}</ref> Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), came to Danville and spoke at High Street Baptist Church about the police brutality. He said it was the worst he had seen in the South. The date of one protest on June 10, 1963, later came to be referred to as \"Bloody Monday\".<ref name=NA>{{cite news|last1=Crane|first1=John R.|title=Bloody Monday: History-changing day|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/go_dan_river/news/danville/bloody-monday-history-changing-day/article_c1366350-ca50-11e2-949c-0019bb30f31a.html |accessdate=4 November 2015 |publisher=News-Advance |date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) sent organizers to Danville to support the local movement. They helped lead protests, including demonstrations at the [[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson Hotel]] and restaurant on Lee Highway. The hotel was known for discriminating locally against blacks as customers and excluding them as workers. A special grand jury indicted 13 DCPA, [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]], and SNCC activists for violating the \"John Brown\" law. This law, passed in 1830 after a slave uprising, made it a serious felony to \"...incite the colored population to acts of violence or war against the white population.\" It became known as the \"John Brown\" law in 1860 because it was used to convict and hang abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] after his raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] in 1859.<ref name=CRMV/>\n\nBy the end of August, more than 600 protesters had been arrested in Danville on charges of inciting to violence, contempt, trespassing, disorderly conduct, assault, parading without a permit, and resisting arrest. Because of the large number of arrests on these charges, often the jails were overcrowded, and protesters were housed in detention facilities in other nearby jurisdictions. The demonstrations failed to achieve desegregation in Danville at that time. Town facilities remained segregated until after passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. African-American residents were mostly unable to register and vote until after the federal government enforced their constitutional rights under the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref name=CRMV/>\n\n===Late 20th century to present===\n[[File:Shuttered textile mill Dan River Mills Danville Virginia.JPG|thumb|right|Abandoned Dan River Mills on the [[Dan River]]]]\nSince the late 20th century, the textile industry has moved to offshore, cheaper labor markets. The Dan River mill has closed and many of its buildings have been torn down, with the bricks sold for other uses. \"The White Mill\" of the Dan Mill complex, considered historically and architecturally significant, is being renovated in the early 21st century as an apartment complex.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the restructuring of the tobacco, textile, and railroad industries all had an adverse effect, resulting in the loss of many jobs in Danville. The decline in passenger traffic caused the Danville station to fall into disuse. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995, and has been renovated by a combination of public and private funding. Today its transportation center serves Amtrak passengers, with part of the station devoted to the first satellite facility of the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. Related spaces have been developed for a park with amphitheater, a community meeting and recreation facility, and the [http://www.danville-va.gov/index.aspx?NID=532 Danville Farmer's Market].  The city used ISTEA funds in association with the Virginia Department of Transportation, and partnered also with Amtrak, Pepsi-Cola, and other private sources. The station renovations were completed in 1996. This project spurred investment in other warehouse properties, \"which have been redeveloped into offices, commercial spaces, apartments, lofts, and restaurants. The approximately $4 million of federal grant money initiated the redevelopment and leveraged additional funds from public and private sources.\"<ref name=\"danstation\">[http://www.greatamericanstations.com/stations/danville-va-dan/ \"Danville, VA (DAN)\"], The Great American Stations, 2013\u20132018, Amtrak; accessed 17 March 2018</ref>\n\nThe city and region continue to work to develop new bases for the economy. The losses have made it difficult to preserve the city's many architecturally and historically significant properties dating from its more prosperous years. In 2007 [[Preservation Virginia]] President William B. Kerkam, III, and its Executive Director Elizabeth S. Kostelny announced at a press conference held in Danville at Main Street Methodist Church that the entire city of Danville had been named as one of the Most Endangered Historic Sites in Virginia. It is working to preserve and redevelop the River District as a center for the community and to stimulate heritage tourism.\n\n==Geography==\nDanville is located along the southern border of Virginia, {{convert|70|mi}} south of [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and {{convert|45|mi}} northeast of [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], via [[U.S. Route 29]].

Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] group of researchers. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name=\"Fernald\">Fernald LD (2008).

Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\n\n<!--Subjects and methods:-->\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]]. This extends to interaction between people, such as [[interpersonal relationship]]s, including [[psychological resilience]], [[family resilience]], and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name =\"reference_name_A\">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In [[eclecticism|addition]], or in [[antipositivism|opposition]], to employing empirical and deductive methods, some\u2014especially [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologists\u2014at times rely upon [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]] and other [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] techniques.

This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as [[John B.

Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of [[scientific experimentation]].<ref>[[Derek Russell Davis]] (DRD), \"psychology\", in Richard L.

This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin\u2013yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, \"China\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\nDistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, \"From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India\", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>\n\nPsychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum\u2014most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of M\u00fcnster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K.

Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. They carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the [[id, ego, and super-ego]].<ref>Carver, C., & Scheier, M. (2004). Perspectives on Personality (5th ed.).

Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, an early biologically-based model proposed by Hans Eysenck, the 3rd mostly highly cited psychologist of the 20th Century (after Freud, and Piaget respectively), suggested that at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality structure: [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion\u2013introversion]], [[neuroticism]]-stability, and [[psychoticism]]-normality.

Cognitive psychologists have used a \"filter\" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. For this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between ''[[implicit memory|implicit]]'' and ''[[explicit memory|explicit]]'' memory.

With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, \"Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview\", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation\" (pp. 9\u201384).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P.

This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Genes and environment ===\n{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}\n\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702\u2013709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160\u2013164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name=\"Behavior Genetics\" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype.

Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]\u2014judgment of character based on the face\u2014described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece. Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nWhen experimental psychology came to Britain, Francis Galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as ''[[psychometrics]]'').<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> James McKeen Cattell, a student of Wundt and Galton, brought the concept to the United States, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 45\u201346.</ref> In 1901, Cattell's student [[Clark Wissler]] published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of Columbia and Barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.<ref name=Gregory2011Pages45and46 /> In response to 1904 orders from the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Public Instruction]], French psychologists [[Alfred Binet]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Simon]] elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905\u20131911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H. Goddard]] put the Binet-Simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as ''imbecile'' and ''feebleminded''. In 1916 (after Binet's death), Stanford professor [[Lewis M. Terman]] modified the Binet-Simon scale (renamed the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford\u2013Binet scale]]) and introduced the [[intelligence quotient]] as a score report.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 50\u201356.</ref> From this test, Terman concluded that mental retardation \"represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among Spanish-Indians and Mexican families of the Southwest and also among negroes. Their dullness seems to be racial.\"<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3>Guthrie, ''Even the Rat was White'' (1998), Chapter 3: \"Psychometric Scientism\" (pp. 55\u201387)</ref>\n\nFollowing the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests for soldiers in World War I, mental testing became popular in the US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the [[College Entrance Examination Board]] created the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] to standardize college admissions.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), p. 61.</ref> The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions\u2014i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a [[Horace Mann Bond]] and [[Allison Davis]].<ref name=Guthrie1998Chapter3 /> Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded.<ref name=GuthrieChapter4 /> In the United States, tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case ''[[Buck v.

[\u2026] Tests are used in almost every nation on earth for counseling, selection, and placement. Testing occurs in settings as diverse as schools, civil service, industry, medical clinics, and counseling centers. Most persons have taken dozens of tests and thought nothing of it. Yet, by the time the typical individual reaches retirement age, it is likely that psychological test results will have helped to shape his or her destiny.\"</ref> Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, [[reliability (psychometrics)|consistency of results]], output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, [[test validity|effective prediction]] of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n=== Mental health care ===\nThe provision of psychological health services is generally called ''clinical psychology'' in the U.S. The definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology and counseling psychology. Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}</ref>\n\nCredit for the first psychology clinic in the United States typically goes to Lightner Witmer, who established his practice in Philadelphia in 1896. Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]].<ref name=StrickerWidiger>George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, \"Volume Preface\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> For the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, \"Psychodynamic Psychotherapy\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nPsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, \"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nMental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, \"The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900\u20131980s\", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. This degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.<ref name=HallHurley />\n\nSome clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury\u2014this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, \"Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office\u2014Get into the Field!\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition.\"</ref>\n\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential\u2013humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223\u20131233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377\u2013400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

The work of child psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, [[Jean Piaget]], and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nSchool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Association of School Psychologists |title=Who are school psychologists? |url=http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |accessdate=1 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517055058/http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |archivedate=17 May 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Work ===\n{{see also|Industrial and organizational psychology|Organizational behavior}}\nIndustrialists soon brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of [[scientific management]] techniques for improving workplace efficiency.

Koppes, \"Industrial-Organizational Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 1: ''History of Psychology''.</ref> An important early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924\u20131932. With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist [[Elton Mayo]], Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term [[Hawthorne effect]] is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.<ref>Yeh Hsueh, \"The Hawthorne experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American industrial psychology, 1929\u20131932\"; ''History of Psychology'' 5.2, May 2002.</ref>\n\nThe name industrial and organizational psychology (I\u2013O) arose in the 1960s and became enshrined as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]], Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973.<ref name=Koppes /> The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I\u2013O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers.

Psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. In the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to seem like it originates from a different source.<ref>[[Cordwainer Smith|Paul M.A. Linebarger]], ''Psychological Warfare''; Washington: Combat Forces Press, 1954.</ref> The [[CIA]]'s [[MKULTRA]] program involved more individualized efforts at [[mind control]], involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of [[LSD]].<ref>See \"[https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/13inmate_ProjectMKULTRA.pdf Project MKULTRA, the CIA's Program of Research in Behavioral Modification]\"; Joint Hearing before the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Committee on Human Resources, United States Senate, Ninety Fifth Congress, First Session, 3 August 1997; and [[John D.

A prominent aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.<ref>Marilu Price Berry, \"Interdisciplinary Medical Setting: The Multiple Roles of a Health Psychologist\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005).</ref>\n\nPsychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies. Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole [[population]]s of people.<ref>Monica L. Baskin, \"Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health\", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001).\"</ref>\n\nBlack American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v.

In 2010, ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[gratitude journal]]ing and the physical expression of gratitude. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[placebo]]s, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.\n\n== Research methods ==\n{{Main|Psychological research|List of psychological research methods}}\n\n[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena.

In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, \"Psychotherapy Outcome Research\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\n\n[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, \"Program Evaluation\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\n\nExperimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], \"Experimental Design\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Other forms of statistical inference ===\n[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, \"Neuropsychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies|longitudinal]] studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\n\n[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, \"Meta-Analysis\", ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Technological assays ===\n[[File:EEG cap.jpg|alt=|thumb|An EEG recording setup]]\nA classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. [[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the [[delta wave]] observed during non-REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = R\u00f6sler | first1 = Frank | title = From Single-Channel Recordings to Brain-Mapping Devices: The Impact of Electroencephalography on Experimental Psychology | url = http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/busey/eegseminar/pdfs/EEGHistoryImpact.pdf | journal = History of Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 1| year = 2005 | doi=10.1037/1093-4510.8.1.95 | pmid = 16021767 | pages=95\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nNewer [[functional neuroimaging]] techniques include [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[positron emission tomography]], both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate\u2014or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic [[neural network]] model rather than a localized function model.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moran | first1 = Joseph M. | last2 = Zaki | first2 = Jamil | title = Functional Neuroimaging and Psychology: What Have You Done for Me Lately? | url = http://ssnl.stanford.edu/download/file/fid/518| journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = 6| year = 2013 | doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00380 | pages=834\u2013842 | pmid=23469884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cacioppo | first1 = John T. | last2 = Berntson | first2 = Gary G. | last3 = Nusbaum | first3 = Howard C. | title = Neuroimaging as a New Tool in the Toolbox of Psychological Science | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00550.x | pages = 62\u201367 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141031185051/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbn08.pdf | archivedate = 31 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aue | first1 = Tatjana | last2 = Lavelle | first2 = Leah A. | last3 = Cacioppo | first3 = John T. | title = Great expectations: What can fMRI research tell us about psychological phenomena? | url = http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.12.017 | pages = 10\u201316 | pmid = 19232374 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160109084331/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/alc09.pdf | archivedate = 9 January 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPsychiatric interventions such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and drugs also provide information about brain\u2013mind interactions. [[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\n\n[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]\n\n=== Computer simulation ===\n{{See also|Computational cognition}}\nComputational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.\n\n=== Animal studies ===\n[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]\n\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\n\n=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===\nResearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\n\n[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].\n\n[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P. Gage]] survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and is remembered for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior.<ref>[[Phineas Gage#References|Harlow (1868)]], Fig. 2, p. 347 Harlow, John Martyn (1868). \"Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head.\" Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society 2:327\u2013347 (Republished in Macmillan 2000).</ref>]]\n\nJust as [[Jane Goodall]] studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct [[naturalistic observation]] of ongoing human social, professional, and family life. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\n\n===Program Evaluation===\n[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Criticism}}Contemporary issues in methodology and practice ==\n=== Metascience ===\nThe field of [[metascience]] has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research.

Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).\n\nThe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.\n\n=== Humans ===\nUniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>\n\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of Psychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, \"Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />\n\n=== Other animals ===\nCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291\u2013305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants.

Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] phenomena, as well as [[feeling]] and [[thought]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader [[Neuroscience|neuroscientific]] group of researchers. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.<ref name=\"Fernald\">Fernald LD (2008).

Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[neurobiology|biological]] processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.\n\n<!--Subjects and methods:-->\nPsychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[intelligence]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|subjective experiences]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], and [[personality psychology|personality]]. This extends to interaction between people, such as [[interpersonal relationship]]s, including [[psychological resilience]], [[family resilience]], and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.<ref name =\"reference_name_A\">Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of [[depth psychology]] are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.</ref> Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In [[eclecticism|addition]], or in [[antipositivism|opposition]], to employing empirical and deductive methods, some\u2014especially [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologists\u2014at times rely upon [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]] and other [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] techniques. Psychology has been described as a \"hub science\" in that medicine tends to draw psychological research via neurology and [[psychiatry]], whereas social sciences most commonly draws directly from [[List of psychology disciplines|sub-disciplines within psychology]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2007/september-07/psychology-is-a-hub-science.html |title=Psychology is a Hub Science|journal=Aps Observer|volume=20|issue=8|quote=psychology is a hub discipline \u2014 that is, a discipline in which scientific research is cited by scientists in many other fields.

This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as [[John B.

Also since James defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of [[scientific experimentation]].<ref>[[Derek Russell Davis]] (DRD), \"psychology\", in Richard L.

Westport, Connecticut: Praeger.</ref> As early as the 4th century BC, Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] theorized that [[mental disorder]]s had physical rather than supernatural causes.<ref>T.L. Brink.

This body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. It frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as ''[[Huangdi Neijing|The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine]]'' identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on [[Yin and yang|yin\u2013yang]] balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the [[Qing Dynasty]] with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), [[Liu Zhi (scholar)|Liu Zhi]] (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and [[insomnia]], and advanced a theory of [[Lateralization of brain function|hemispheric lateralization]] in brain function.<ref name=HsuehGuo>Yeh Hsueh and Benyu Guo, \"China\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\nDistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of India, influenced by [[Hinduism]]. A central idea of the [[Upanishads]] is the distinction between a person's transient mundane self and their [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|eternal unchanging soul]]. Divergent Hindu doctrines, and Buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. [[Yoga]] is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. Much of the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit corpus]] was suppressed under the [[British East India Company]] followed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1800s. However, Indian doctrines influenced Western thinking via the [[Theosophical Society]], a [[New Age]] group which became popular among Euro-American intellectuals.<ref name=Paranjpe>Anand C. Paranjpe, \"From Tradition through Colonialism to Globalization: Reflections on the History of Psychology in India\", in Brock (ed.), ''Internationalizing the History of Psychology'' (2006).</ref>\n\nPsychology was a popular topic in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Europe. In Germany, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646\u20131716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum\u2014most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] identified psychology as its own science, writing ''Psychologia empirica'' in 1732 and ''Psychologia rationalis'' in 1734. This notion advanced further under [[Immanuel Kant]], who established the idea of [[History of anthropology|anthropology]], with psychology as an important subdivision. However, Kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of [[experimental psychology]], writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" In 1783, [[Ferdinand Ueberwasser]] (1752-1812) designated himself ''Professor of Empirical Psychology and Logic'' and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], after which the Old University of M\u00fcnster was discontinued by Prussian authorities.<ref>Schwarz, K. A., & Pfister, R.: ''Scientific psychology in the 18th century: a historical rediscovery.'' In: ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'', Nr. 11, p. 399-407.</ref> Having consulted philosophers [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]], however, in 1825 the [[Prussia]]n state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential [[Prussian education system|educational system]]. However, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.<ref name=Horst>Horst U.K. Gundlach, \"Germany\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref> In England, early psychology involved [[phrenology]] and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country's well-populated mental asylums.<ref>Alan Collins, \"England\", in Baker (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook of the History of Psychology'' (2012).</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of experimental psychology ===\n[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.]]\n\n[[Gustav Fechner]] began conducting [[psychophysics]] research in [[Leipzig]] in the 1830s, articulating the principle ([[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]) that human perception of a stimulus varies [[logarithmically]] according to its intensity.<ref>Leahey, ''History of Modern Psychology'' (2001), p. 61.</ref> Fechner's 1860 ''Elements of Psychophysics'' challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind.<ref>Fechner, G.

Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological [[laboratory]] which brought experimental psychology to the world.

They developed a concept of \"recognition\" ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=|p=jen-shih}}) which referred the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview (failure to correspond with party doctrine was \"incorrect recognition\").<ref>Chin & Chin, ''Psychological Research in Communist China'' (1969), pp. 9\u201317. \"The Soviet psychology that Peking modeled itself upon was a Marxist-Leninist psychology with a philosophical base in dialectical materialism and a newly added label, Pavlovianism. This new Soviet psychology leaned heavily on Lenin's theory of reflection, which was unearthed in his two volumes posthumously published in 1924. Toward the late twenties, a group of Soviet research psychologists headed by Vygotskii, along with Luria and Leont'ev, laid the groundwork for a Marxist-Leninist approach to psychic development.\"</ref> Psychology education was centralized under the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], supervised by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].

Cognitive psychologists have used a \"filter\" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. Copious research has shown that subconscious ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]'' of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.<ref name=Kihlstrom1999 /> A significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject's conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting.

With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.<ref name=ForgasEtAl>Forgas, Williams, & Laham, \"Social Motivation: Introduction and Overview\", in Forgas, Williams, & Laham, ''Social Motivation'' (2005).</ref> According to [[drive theory]], the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the [[reality principle]], roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', Freud introduced the concept of the ''[[death drive]]'', a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and [[Repetition compulsion|psychic repetition of traumatic events]].<ref>Weiner, ''Human Motivation'' (2013), Chapter 2, \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Motivation\" (pp. 9\u201384).</ref> Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.<ref name=ForgasEtAl /><ref name=GodsilEtAl>Bill P. Godsil, Matthew R. Tinsley, & Michael S.

Tory Higgins]], ''Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works''; Oxford University Press, 2012; {{ISBN|978-0-19-976582-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>Shah & Gardner, ''Handbook of Motivation Science'' (2008), entire volume.{{page needed|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\nMotivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways.

This may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. Researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Genes and environment ===\n{{Main|Behavioral genetics}}\n\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng.3285 |pmid=25985137 |title=Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=702\u2013709 |year=2015 |last1=Polderman |first1=Tinca J C. |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=De Leeuw |first3=Christiaan A. |last4=Sullivan |first4=Patrick F. |last5=Van Bochoven |first5=Arjen |last6=Visscher |first6=Peter M. |last7=Posthuma |first7=Danielle |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:364460/UQ364460_OA.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00084 |title=Three Laws of Behavior Genetics and What They Mean |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=160\u2013164 |year=2000 |last1=Turkheimer |first1=Eric }}</ref> These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental [[behavioral genetic]] research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.<ref name=\"Behavior Genetics\" /> Traditionally this research has been conducted using [[twin studies]] and [[adoption study|adoption studies]], two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of [[microarray]] [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] or [[genome sequencing]] technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and [[psychopathology]] through methods including [[genome-wide association studies]]. One goal of such research is similar to that in [[positional cloning]] and its success in [[Huntington's]]: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype.

The system was ended in 1906.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 41\u201342.</ref> In Europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of [[physiognomy]]\u2014judgment of character based on the face\u2014described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece.

Binet and Simon introduced the concept of [[mental age]] and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as ''[[idiot]]s''. [[Henry H.

[\u2026] Tests are used in almost every nation on earth for counseling, selection, and placement. Testing occurs in settings as diverse as schools, civil service, industry, medical clinics, and counseling centers. Most persons have taken dozens of tests and thought nothing of it. Yet, by the time the typical individual reaches retirement age, it is likely that psychological test results will have helped to shape his or her destiny.\"</ref> Modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, [[reliability (psychometrics)|consistency of results]], output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, [[test validity|effective prediction]] of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.<ref>Gregory, ''Psychological Testing'' (2011), pp. 4\u20136.</ref>\n\n=== Mental health care ===\nThe provision of psychological health services is generally called ''clinical psychology'' in the U.S. The definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology and counseling psychology. Practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. In Canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of ''[[professional psychology]]''. In Canada and the US, practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.<ref name=HallHurley /> Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.<ref name=StrickerWidiger /> It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or [[mental illness]] and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.<ref name=\"brain\">Brain, Christine.

Another modern psychotherapist was [[Morton Prince]].<ref name=StrickerWidiger>George Stricker & Thomas A. Widiger, \"Volume Preface\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref> For the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the United States was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. Psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. For their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] to understand and treat the mentally ill.<ref name=Tomes2008 /> In this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. The therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. An important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is [[transference]], in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.<ref>[[Nancy McWilliams]] and Joel Weinberger, \"Psychodynamic Psychotherapy\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nPsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of [[Community mental health service|community mental health facilities]] and [[behavioral therapy]], a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. A key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness. In the 1970s, [[cognitive-behavior therapy]] arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. A key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.<ref>W. Edward Craighead & Linda Wilcoxon Craighead, \"Behavioral and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nMental health care today involves psychologists and [[social work]]ers in increasing numbers. In 1977, National Institute of Mental Health director [[Bertram Brown (physician)|Bertram Brown]] described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".<ref name=Tomes2008>Nancy Tomes, \"The Development of Clinical Psychology, Social Work, and Psychiatric Nursing: 1900\u20131980s\", in Wallace & Gach (eds.), ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology'' (2008).</ref> Graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (PhD or PsyD) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s.

In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. The emerging field of ''disaster psychology'' (see [[crisis intervention]]) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.<ref>Teri L. Elliott, \"Disaster Psychology: Keep Clients out of Your Office\u2014Get into the Field!\" in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"...it is the disaster psychologist's role to utilize crisis intervention processes with the goal of preventing natural distress due to the critical event from developing into a more harmful, long-term psychological condition.\"</ref>\n\nThe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). Typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential\u2013humanistic, and systems or family therapy. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Leichsenring, Falk |author2=Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223\u20131233 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 |pmid=12832233}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377\u2013400|doi=10.1007/BF03395517 |url=https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1192&context=tpr }}</ref> Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Jensen, J.P. |author2=Bergin, A.E. |author3=Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}</ref><ref>Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

Baskin, \"Public Health: Career Opportunities for Psychologists in Public Health\", in Morgan et al. (ed.), ''Life After Graduate School in Psychology'' (2005). \"Prevention strategies of late have largely concentrated on community-based interventions, which have been shown to be effective in changing the health of large populations. Behavioral and social scientists, such as psychologists, are helpful in this arena as we are trained to view individuals as belonging to complex and dynamic social systems, including immediate and extended family systems, acquaintance and friendship networks, neighborhood and community systems, and cultural groups (Schneiderman & Spee4, 2001).\"</ref>\n\nBlack American psychologists [[Kenneth and Mamie Clark]] studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case ''[[Brown v.

In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called [[independent variable]]s, and measures resulting changes of interest, called [[dependent variable]]s. Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n[[Repeated-measures experiment]]s are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. In research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. Treatment type is the independent variable. The dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.<ref>Evelyn S. Behar & Thomas D. Borkovec, \"Psychotherapy Outcome Research\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> Using [[crossover study|crossover design]], researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\n\n[[Quasi-experimental design]] refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's [[Validity (logic)|validity]].<ref>Melvin M. Mark, \"Program Evaluation\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> For example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\n\nExperimental researchers typically use a [[statistical hypothesis testing]] model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific [[hypothesis]] about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the [[null hypothesis]] that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely used standard ascribes [[statistical significance]] to results which have less than 5% [[p-value|probability of being explained by random variation]].<ref>[[Roger E. Kirk]], \"Experimental Design\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n=== Other forms of statistical inference ===\n[[Statistical survey]]s are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n[[Neuropsychological tests]], such as the [[David Wechsler|Wechsler scales]] and [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]], are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. These can be used in experiments, as in the case of [[lesion]] experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.<ref>Russell M. Bauer, Elizabeth C. Leritz, & Dawn Bowers, \"Neuropsychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref>\n\n[[Observational studies]] analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; [[multivariate statistics]] are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. [[Cross-sectional studies|Cross-sectional]] observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas [[longitudinal studies|longitudinal]] studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as ''selective attrition'' (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\n\n[[Exploratory data analysis]] refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|Peirce's three modes of inference]], exploratory data analysis corresponds to [[abduction (logic)|abduction]], or hypothesis formation.<ref>John T. Behrens and Chong-Ho Yu, \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 2: ''Research Methods in Psychology''.</ref> [[Meta-analysis]] is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.<ref>Frank L.

[[Hans Berger]], the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness.

These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate\u2014or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality.

[[Psychopharmacology]] is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\n\n[[File:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]\n\n=== Computer simulation ===\n{{See also|Computational cognition}}\nComputational modeling is a tool used in [[mathematical psychology]] and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.<ref>Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.</ref> This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human. Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.\n\n=== Animal studies ===\n[[File:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]\n\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. There are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title= Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate= 1 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080708190108/http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. It is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]].<ref>Shettleworth, S.J. (2010) Cognition, Evolution and Behavior (2nd Ed), New York: Oxford.</ref> Research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the [[Sociobiology]] of [[E.O. Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, E.O. (1978) ''On Human Nature'' p. x, Cambridge, Ma: Harvard</ref> Animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\n\n=== Qualitative and descriptive research ===\nResearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as ''descriptive research''. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. ''Qualitative research'' is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\n\n[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, [[ethnography]], [[case study]], and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers<ref>Glaser, B. & Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.</ref> sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or [[critical theory|critiques]] of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}<!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--> or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].\n\n[[File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P.

Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\n\n===Program Evaluation===\n[[Program Evaluation]] is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,<ref>Administration for Children and Families (2010) ''[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/other_resrch/pm_guide_eval/index.html The Program Manager's Guide to Evaluation]. Chapter 2: What is program evaluation?''.</ref> particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shackman|first=Gene|title=What Is Program Evaluation: A Beginner's Guide|publisher=The Global Social Change Research Project|ssrn=3060080|date=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Criticism}}Contemporary issues in methodology and practice ==\n=== Metascience ===\nThe field of [[metascience]] has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research.

Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of [[Guidelines for human subject research#APA Ethics Code|established codes]] the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]).\n\nThe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.\n\n=== Humans ===\nUniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.<ref>The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]</ref>\n\nThe ethics code of the American Psychological Association originated in 1951 as \"Ethical Standards of Psychologists\". This code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most American states. It has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. In 1989, the APA revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. The 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. Members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about APA members with the APA ethics committee; members of the APA have a three-year window.<ref name=HandbookJones>Stanley E. Jones, \"Ethical Issues in Clinical Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), ''Handbook of Psychology'' (2003), Volume 8: ''Clinical Psychology''.</ref>\n\nSome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. Another important principle is [[informed consent]], the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.<ref name=HandbookJones /> Some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.<ref name=HandbookJones />\n\n=== Other animals ===\nCurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwin | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Christionsen | first2 = S.B. | last3 = Duncan | first3 = I.J. | last4 = Erhard | first4 = H.W. | last5 = Lay Jr. | first5 = D.C. | last6 = Mench | first6 = J.A. | last7 = O'Connor | first7 = C.E. | last8 = Petherick | first8 = J.C. | year = 2003 | title = Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 291\u2013305 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(02)00288-5}}</ref> Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n* An experiment by Stanley Milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants. It measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience.<ref>Milgram, Stanley.

He studied until eighth grade and discontinued his studies as he could not cope with studying. Innocent went to Madras (then) for his acting career and worked there as a production executive and during that time he acted in a minor role in the movie ''Nellu'', which was one of his earlier  movies. He fell ill, and came to Davangere in the 1970s for treatment for Typhoid, where his cousins (George, studying medicine at JJM Medical College), Davis and his brother were running the Shamannur Match factory, at Davangere. Later, he was an active partner in the working of the factory. As Innocent was keen on the performance activities, he seized the opportunity to participate in Davangere, Kerala Samajam drama and received audience approval in entertainment events.\n\nHe left Davangere in 1974, set up a leather business, then a cycle renting business to make a living. He always had constant conflict with his father, Vareed, since his brothers all took on prestigious law or medical professions. Later, he joined politics and became Municipal councilor of Irinjalakuda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinidiary.com/people.php?pigsection=Actor&picata=1&no_of_displayed_rows=18&no_of_rows_page=10&sletter=|title=CINIDIARY - A Complete Online Malayalam Cinema News Portal|website=cinidiary.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150507174335/http://cinidiary.com/people.php?pigsection=Actor&picata=1&no_of_displayed_rows=18&no_of_rows_page=10&sletter=|archivedate=7 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Film career==\nInnocent's mannerisms and diction is unique in Malayalam cinema and he wildly caught the attention of the Malayalam audience. This made him a phenomenon in the Malayalam comedy scene, also making him a hot favourite for mimicry artistes. His popularity can be gauged from the fact that many frontline directors in Malayalam (like [[Priyadarshan]], [[Sathyan Anthikad|Satyan Anthikkad]], [[Fazil (director)|Fazil]] and [[Kamal (director)|Kamal]]) rarely ever make films without casting Innocent. He has proven his acting skills in serious and character roles in several films and became an icon of the Malayalam film industry. He has been the president of [[Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes]] (AMMA) for 12 years. He has held the post for the last four consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=14600115&programId=1073752204&channelId=-1073750705&BV_ID=@@@&tabId=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131213082544/http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=14600115&programId=1073752204&channelId=-1073750705&BV_ID=@@@&tabId=3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2013 |title=Movies &#124; Interviews &#124; |publisher=Manorama Online |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nInnocent entered the film industry in 1972 with the movie ''Nrityashala''. At first, he produced a few serious offbeat films, but he was not successful. In the long span of his career, Innocent has worked in more than 500 films in a variety of roles, mainly in [[Malayalam]]. He has also acted in a few [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] and [[Hindi cinema|Hindi]] films.\n\nInnocent played key comedy roles in superhits like ''[[Ramji Rao Speaking]]'', ''[[Mannar Mathai Speaking]]'', ''[[Kilukkam]]'', ''[[Godfather (1991 film)|Godfather]]'', ''[[Vietnam Colony]]'', ''[[Nadodikattu]]'' and ''[[Devaasuram]]''.\nInnocent has also excelled in character and villain roles such as ''[[Keli (film)|Keli]]'',''[[Kathodu Kathoram]]''.\n\nHe proved his skills in other serious roles with a touch of laughter in films such as ''[[Kabooliwala|Kabooliwaala]]'', ''[[Gajakesariyogam]]'', ''[[Mithunam (1993 film)|Mithunam]]'', ''[[Mazhavilkavadi]]'', ''[[Manassinakkare]]'', ''[[Thuruppugulan (2006 film)|Thuruppugulan]]'', ''[[Rasathanthram]]'', and ''[[Mahasamudram]]''. His effort, along with that of the superstars who starred in these films, played an important role in their success. His pairing with [[K. P. A. C. Lalitha]] was highly successful in movies such as ''[[Ponmuttayidunna Tharavu|Ponn Muttayidunna Tharavu]]'', ''[[My Dear Muthachan|My Dear Muthachchan]]'', ''[[Godfather (1991 film)|Godfather]]'' and ''[[Manichitrathazhu]]''.\n\nInnocent is one of the most imitated actors of [[Malayalam cinema]] and [[mimicry]] artists have brought him closer to women and children among his fans. The best example of this can be seen in the widely popular Maveli ([[Mahabali]]) comedy cassettes which are brought out by various mimicry groups annually in association with the [[Onam]] festival of [[Kerala]] in the past few years. These cassettes satirise [[Mahabali]], a benevolent King in Kerala's mythology, who is supposed to visit his subjects in [[Kerala]] every lunar year on the day of [[Onam]]. These cassettes tend to portray Maveli ([[Mahabali]]) as a comic King who gets into all sort of troubles \u2013 the script makes use of many contemporary issues in [[Kerala]] \u2013 on his annual arrival in Kerala. Mimicry artistes uses Innocent's voice to represent Maveli and all his mannerisms and idiosyncrasies in speech are deftly mimicked to generate laughter in the audience.\n\nInnocent's participation in stage shows guarantees him a leading role as an anchor or performer. His [[Katha (storytelling format)|Kathaprasangam]] (oratory combined with poetry) ''Olayaal Menjoru'' is one of the regulars in Gulf stage shows.\n\nInnocent has published his memoirs: ''Njan Innocent''. He has published three other books: ''Mazha Kannadi'' (collection of short stories), ''Chirrikku Pinnil'' (an autobiography) and ''Cancer Wardile Chiri'' (Laughter in the Cancer Ward), an account of his experiences while undergoing treatment for throat cancer.<ref name=\"Cancer Wardile Chiri\">{{Cite book| title=Cancer Wardile Chiri | publisher=Mathrubhui Books | date=12 December 2013 | author=Innocent | page=127 | isbn=9788182661110| id= {{ASIN|8182659108|country=in}} }}</ref> Innocent also writes columns in magazines and newspapers.\n\n==Politics==\nInnocent was the Thrissur District Secretary of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] during the 1970s.

His popularity can be gauged from the fact that many frontline directors in Malayalam (like [[Priyadarshan]], [[Sathyan Anthikad|Satyan Anthikkad]], [[Fazil (director)|Fazil]] and [[Kamal (director)|Kamal]]) rarely make films without Innocent. He has proven his acting skills in serious and character roles in several films. He has been the president of [[Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes]] (AMMA) for 12 years. He has held the post for the last four consecutive terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=14600115&programId=1073752204&channelId=-1073750705&BV_ID=@@@&tabId=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131213082544/http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=14600115&programId=1073752204&channelId=-1073750705&BV_ID=@@@&tabId=3 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2013 |title=Movies &#124; Interviews &#124; |publisher=Manorama Online |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nInnocent entered the film industry in 1972 with the movie ''Nrityashala''. At first, he produced a few serious offbeat films, but he was not successful. In the long span of his career, Innocent has worked in more than 500 films in a variety of roles, mainly in [[Malayalam]]. He has also acted in a few [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] and [[Hindi cinema|Hindi]] films.\n\nInnocent played key comedy roles in superhits like ''[[Ramji Rao Speaking]]'', ''[[Mannar Mathai Speaking]]'', ''[[Kilukkam]]'', ''[[Godfather (1991 film)|Godfather]]'', ''[[Vietnam Colony]]'', ''[[Nadodikattu]]'' and ''[[Devaasuram]]''.\nInnocent has also excelled in character and villain roles such as ''[[Keli (film)|Keli]]'',''[[Kathodu Kathoram]]''.\n\nHe proved his skills in other serious roles with a touch of laughter in films such as ''[[Kabooliwala|Kabooliwaala]]'', ''[[Gajakesariyogam]]'', ''[[Mithunam (1993 film)|Mithunam]]'', ''[[Mazhavilkavadi]]'', ''[[Manassinakkare]]'', ''[[Thuruppugulan (2006 film)|Thuruppugulan]]'', ''[[Rasathanthram]]'', and ''[[Mahasamudram]]''. His effort, along with that of the superstars who starred in these films, played an important role in their success. His pairing with [[K. P. A. C. Lalitha]] was highly successful in movies such as ''[[Ponmuttayidunna Tharavu|Ponn Muttayidunna Tharavu]]'', ''[[My Dear Muthachan|My Dear Muthachchan]]'', ''[[Godfather (1991 film)|Godfather]]'' and ''[[Manichitrathazhu]]''.\n\nInnocent is one of the most imitated actors of [[Malayalam cinema]] and [[mimicry]] artists have brought him closer to women and children among his fans. The best example of this can be seen in the widely popular Maveli ([[Mahabali]]) comedy cassettes which are brought out by various mimicry groups annually in association with the [[Onam]] festival of [[Kerala]] in the past few years. These cassettes satirise [[Mahabali]], a benevolent King in Kerala's mythology, who is supposed to visit his subjects in [[Kerala]] every lunar year on the day of [[Onam]]. These cassettes tend to portray Maveli ([[Mahabali]]) as a comic King who gets into all sort of troubles \u2013 the script makes use of many contemporary issues in [[Kerala]] \u2013 on his annual arrival in Kerala. Mimicry artistes uses Innocent's voice to represent Maveli and all his mannerisms and idiosyncrasies in speech are deftly mimicked to generate laughter in the audience.\n\nInnocent's participation in stage shows guarantees him a leading role as an anchor or performer. His [[Katha (storytelling format)|Kathaprasangam]] (oratory combined with poetry) ''Olayaal Menjoru'' is one of the regulars in Gulf stage shows.\n\nInnocent has published his memoirs: ''Njan Innocent''. He has published three other books: ''Mazha Kannadi'' (collection of short stories), ''Chirrikku Pinnil'' (an autobiography) and ''Cancer Wardile Chiri'' (Laughter in the Cancer Ward), an account of his experiences while undergoing treatment for throat cancer.<ref name=\"Cancer Wardile Chiri\">{{Cite book| title=Cancer Wardile Chiri | publisher=Mathrubhui Books | date=12 December 2013 | author=Innocent | page=127 | isbn=9788182661110| id= {{ASIN|8182659108|country=in}} }}</ref> Innocent also writes columns in magazines and newspapers.\n\n==Politics==\nInnocent was the Thrissur District Secretary of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (India)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] during the 1970s.

The main concept of the Spice Girl albums centred on the idea of [[Girl Power]], embodying a feminist image, as both [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Bananarama]] had employed before, and every track deals with different aspects of this notion. Other central themes in the writing of the group were the union, solidarity, friendship, independence, love, loss of virginity, sex, contraception, the relationship with parents during adolescence, vulnerability and fame. Many of these themes were carried out even during her solo career, but with a more mature writing, intense style and in some songs a more raw and direct language. Added to these were social issues such as homelessness, and introspective themes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Having co-written 11 UK number 1s, more than any other female artist, she remains the only female performer to top the charts as a solo artist, as part of a duo, quartet and quintet.

The main concept of the Spice Girl albums centred on the idea of [[Girl Power]], embodying a feminist image, as both [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Bananarama]] had employed before, and every track deals with different aspects of this notion. Other central themes in the writing of the group were the union, solidarity, friendship, independence, love, loss of virginity, sex, contraception, the relationship with parents during adolescence, vulnerability and fame. Many of these themes were carried out even during her solo career, but with a more mature writing, intense style and in some songs a more raw and direct language. Added to these were social issues such as homelessness, and introspective themes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Having co-written 11 UK number 1s, more than any other female artist, she remains the only female performer to top the charts as a solo artist, as part of a duo, quartet and quintet.

The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 12, 2014|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, though five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth) employed Hanna-Barbera regular [[Daws Butler]] while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident. Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air. But they also told him, 'Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love and so many parents love, too?'\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Brooks| first = Marla| title = The American family on television: A chronology of 121 shows, 1948\u20132004| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hyTuAAAAMAAJ| year = 2005| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-2074-2| page = 54 }}</ref>\n\nHenry Corden's voice became Fred's after Reed's death in 1977, starting with ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]''.<ref>\"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/28593-Flintstone_Christmas.html A Flintstone Christmas]\".

Since 2000, [[Jeff Bergman]], [[James Arnold Taylor]], and [[Scott Innes]] (performing both Fred and Barney for [[Toshiba]] commercials) have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. Various additional character voices were created by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]], [[Allan Melvin]], [[Janet Waldo]], Daws Butler, and [[Howard Morris]], among others.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Fred Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Alan Reed]] \n* [[Wilma Flintstone]]/[[Pebbles Flintstone]] \u2013 [[Jean Vander Pyl]]\n* [[Barney Rubble]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]; [[Daws Butler]] (season 2; episodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 only)\n* [[Betty Rubble]] \u2013 [[Bea Benaderet]] (seasons 1\u20134); [[Gerry Johnson]] (seasons 5\u20136)\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]]/Hoppy/Arnold \u2013 [[Don Messick]]\n* [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] \u2013 [[Mel Blanc]]\n* Mr. Slate \u2013 [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]\n* [[Pearl Slaghoople|Mrs. Slaghoople]] \u2013 [[Verna Felton]] and [[Janet Waldo]]\n* [[The Great Gazoo]] \u2013 [[Harvey Korman]]\n\n===Additional voice cast===\n* [[Howard Morris]]\n* [[Doug Young (actor)|Doug Young]]\n* [[Henry Corden]]\n* [[June Foray]]\n* [[Walker Edmiston]]\n* [[Ginny Tyler]] as Carhop\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Uncle Tex and Santa Claus\n* [[Allan Melvin]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n{{:List of The Flintstones episodes}}\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Meet the Flintstones}}\nThe opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was called \"Rise and Shine\", a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work.

The musical underscores were credited to [[Hoyt Curtin]] for the show's first five seasons; [[Ted Nichols]] took over in 1965 for the final season.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>  Many early episodes used the underscores composed for \"Top Cat\" and \"The Jetsons.\"   Episodes of the last two seasons used the underscore of \"Jonny Quest\" for the more adventurous stories.\n\n==History and production==\nThe idea of ''The Flintstones'' started after Hanna-Barbera produced ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' and ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]''. Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are only available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, with select clips made available on the official [[YouTube]] account tied to the revamped Kids' WB website.

The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V.

Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air.

Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015.

In 2009 he entered the party [[2009 Ontario New Democratic Party leadership election|leadership convention]] but lost to [[Andrea Horwath]].\n\n==Background==\nTabuns was born in [[London, Ontario]] to Anton Tabuns ({{Lang-lv|Antons Tab\u016bns}}), an auto mechanic, and his wife Sarah, who was born and raised in [[Liverpool, England]]. Anton was born and raised in [[Latvia]], though he managed to leave his homeland after the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|Soviet occupation]] and immigrate to England. While working on a farm, fixing equipment, he met Sarah, and soon after marrying, the couple immigrated to [[Canada]]. Soon after, the family found residence with another recent immigrant.

They have a son, Anton, from Tabuns' previous relationship.\n\n==Municipal politics==\nTabuns was [[Toronto City Council|city councillor]] for Ward 8 - Riverdale - of the former [[Old Toronto|City of Toronto]] from 1990 to 1997, representing part of the Toronto-Danforth riding he now represents provincially. He was a member of the Board of Health for seven years, and was chair from 1993 to 1997. In 1995 he moved to ban [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] in shopping mall food courts. A year later the city extended the ban to include bars and restaurants.<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Small |title=Toronto to end smoking in mall food courts 1996 ban may cover all restaurants |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=October 18, 1995 |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Moloney |title=City softens smoke ban, satisfies few |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=October 9, 1996 |page=A1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, he supported a boycott of [[Harvey's]] restaurants because its parent company [[Cara Operations]] had donated money to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative Party]] for the previous three years. The Board of Health initially passed the motion 7-6 but later rescinded it following a storm of protest. Tabuns was unrepentant and said that corporations must be held accountable for supporting Ontario Premier [[Mike Harris]]. Tabuns said, \"What Mike Harris has done is put greased skids under the economy of this city and pushed it downhill.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Moloney |title=Health board zaps its beef with burger chain |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=March 22, 1996 |page=A5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 the amalgamation of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] reduced the number of councillor positions. Tabuns was forced to compete with fellow NDP councillors [[Pam McConnell]] (who had previously represented Ward 7, adjacent to Tabuns' Ward 8) and [[Jack Layton]] (who had held a seat on Metro Council representing the same area as Wards 7 and 8) for one of two council positions returned by the east-end ward. A phantom candidate named \"Larry Tabin\" also entered the election. It has been alleged that Tabin was enlisted as a candidate by bar and restaurant owners seeking to defeat Tabuns over his anti-smoking initiative; despite his presence on the ballot, Tabin did not actually conduct any visible campaign. In the confusion, Tabin was able to draw enough votes away from Peter Tabuns to cost Tabuns the election.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Dirty Tricks Campaign |newspaper=Canadian Free Press |date=September 12 \u2013 October 3, 2000 |url=http://www.canadafreepress.com/2000/0004a11.htm}}</ref> Tabuns came in third, with about 200 fewer votes than McConnell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/elections/results/results_1997.htm |publisher=[[City of Toronto government]] |title=1997 Election Results |archivedate=June 21, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621190553/http://www.toronto.ca/elections/results/results_1997.htm |date=November 10, 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Greenpeace==\nFrom 1999 to 2004, Tabuns was executive director of [[Greenpeace]] Canada.

A year later the city extended the ban to include bars and restaurants.<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Small |title=Toronto to end smoking in mall food courts 1996 ban may cover all restaurants |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=October 18, 1995 |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Moloney |title=City softens smoke ban, satisfies few |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=October 9, 1996 |page=A1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, he supported a boycott of [[Harvey's]] restaurants because its parent company [[Cara Operations]] had donated money to the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative Party]] for the previous three years. The Board of Health initially passed the motion 7-6 but later rescinded it following a storm of protest. Tabuns was unrepentant and said that corporations must be held accountable for supporting Ontario Premier [[Mike Harris]]. Tabuns said, \"What Mike Harris has done is put greased skids under the economy of this city and pushed it downhill.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Moloney |title=Health board zaps its beef with burger chain |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=March 22, 1996 |page=A5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 the amalgamation of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] reduced the number of councillor positions. Tabuns was forced to compete with fellow NDP councillors [[Pam McConnell]] (who had previously represented Ward 7, adjacent to Tabuns' Ward 8) and [[Jack Layton]] (who had held a seat on Metro Council representing the same area as Wards 7 and 8) for one of two council positions returned by the east-end ward. A phantom candidate named \"Larry Tabin\" also entered the election. It has been alleged that Tabin was enlisted as a candidate by bar and restaurant owners seeking to defeat Tabuns over his anti-smoking initiative; despite his presence on the ballot, Tabin did not actually conduct any visible campaign. In the confusion, Tabin was able to draw enough votes away from Peter Tabuns to cost Tabuns the election.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Dirty Tricks Campaign |newspaper=Canadian Free Press |date=September 12 \u2013 October 3, 2000 |url=http://www.canadafreepress.com/2000/0004a11.htm}}</ref> Tabuns came in third, with about 200 fewer votes than McConnell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toronto.ca/elections/results/results_1997.htm |publisher=[[City of Toronto government]] |title=1997 Election Results |archivedate=June 21, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621190553/http://www.toronto.ca/elections/results/results_1997.htm |date=November 10, 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Greenpeace==\nFrom 1999 to 2004, Tabuns was executive director of [[Greenpeace]] Canada.

France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it could [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|capture Gibraltar]] from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that would be set up an independent [[Indian barrier state]] under Spanish control.<ref>Smith, Dwight L. \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Americans realized that they could get a better deal directly from London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain. The British Prime Minister [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] agreed. He was in charge of the British negotiations (some of which took place in his study at Lansdowne House, now a bar in the Lansdowne Club) and he now saw a chance to split the United States away from France and make the new country a valuable economic partner.<ref name=ritcheson>{{cite journal |last=Ritcheson |first=Charles R. |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40105313?seq=1 |title=The Earl of Shelbourne and Peace with America, 1782\u20131783: Vision and Reality |journal=[[The International History Review]] |volume=5 |issue=3 |date=August 1983 |pages=322\u2013345 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> The western terms were that the United States would gain all of the area east of the Mississippi River, north of Florida, and south of Canada.

Historians such as  Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States.  The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants,  without any military or administrative costs to Britain.<ref name=ritcheson/>  The point was the United States would become a major trading partner. As the French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] later put it, \"The English buy peace rather than make it\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Vermont was included within the boundaries because the state of New York insisted that Vermont was a part of New York, although Vermont was then under a [[Vermont Republic|government that considered Vermont not to be a part of the United States]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel Flagg |authorlink=Samuel Flagg Bemis |last=Bemis |title=The Diplomacy of the American Revolution |year=1957 |publisher=Indiana University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/diplomacyofameri00bemi|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nPrivileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status (including protection from [[Barbary corsairs#United States and the Barbary Wars|pirates]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; see: the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]) were withdrawn. Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also ignored Article 6  (e.g., by confiscating Loyalist property for \"unpaid debts\"). Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors. The British often ignored the provision of Article 7  about removal of slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=James W. |last=Ely Jr. |title=The Guardian of Every Other Right: A Constitutional History of Property Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBXuRfB4DH4C&pg=PA35 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=35 |isbn=978-0199724529}}</ref>\n\nThe actual [[geography of North America]] turned out not to match the details used in the treaty. The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain. While that [[West Florida Controversy]] continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFyLOUrdGFwC&pg=PA23 |title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913 |first=Howard |last=Jones |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8420-2916-2 |page=23}}</ref> The treaty stated that the boundary of the United States extended from the \"[[Northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods|most northwesternmost point]]\" of the [[Lake of the Woods]] (now partly in Minnesota, partly in Manitoba, and partly in Ontario) directly westward until it reached the Mississippi River.  But in fact the Mississippi does not extend that far northward; the line going west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the river.\n\nGreat Britain violated the treaty stipulation that they should relinquish control of forts in United States territory \"with all convenient speed.\" British troops remained stationed at six forts in the [[Great Lakes region]], plus two at the north end of [[Lake Champlain]]. The British also built an additional fort in present-day Ohio in 1794, during the [[Northwest Indian War]]. They found justification for these actions in the unstable and extremely tense situation that existed in the area following the war, in the failure of the United States government to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for their losses, and in the British need for time to liquidate various assets in the region.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu0hgVoIj3UC&pg=PA17 |title=Historic Fort York, 1793\u20131993 |first=Carl |last=Benn |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-920474-79-2 |page=17}}</ref> All posts were relinquished peacefully through diplomatic means as a result of the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]].

France was exhausted by the war, and everyone wanted peace except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it could [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|capture Gibraltar]] from the British. Vergennes came up with the deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take [[Northwest Territory|the area north of the Ohio River]]. In the area south of that would be set up an independent [[Indian barrier state]] under Spanish control.<ref>Smith, Dwight L. \"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46\u201363.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Americans realized that they could get a better deal directly from London. John Jay promptly told the British that he was willing to negotiate directly with them, cutting off France and Spain.

Historians such as  Alvord, Harlow, and Ritcheson have emphasized that British generosity was based on a statesmanlike vision of close economic ties between Britain and the United States.  The concession of the vast trans-Appalachian region was designed to facilitate the growth of the American population and create lucrative markets for British merchants,  without any military or administrative costs to Britain.<ref name=ritcheson/>  The point was the United States would become a major trading partner. As the French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] later put it, \"The English buy peace rather than make it\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Vermont was included within the boundaries because the state of New York insisted that Vermont was a part of New York, although Vermont was then under a [[Vermont Republic|government that considered Vermont not to be a part of the United States]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel Flagg |authorlink=Samuel Flagg Bemis |last=Bemis |title=The Diplomacy of the American Revolution |year=1957 |publisher=Indiana University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/diplomacyofameri00bemi|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nPrivileges that the Americans had received from Britain automatically when they had colonial status (including protection from [[Barbary corsairs#United States and the Barbary Wars|pirates]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; see: the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]) were withdrawn. Individual states ignored federal recommendations, under Article 5, to restore confiscated Loyalist property, and also ignored Article 6  (e.g., by confiscating Loyalist property for \"unpaid debts\"). Some, notably Virginia, also defied Article 4 and maintained laws against payment of debts to British creditors. The British often ignored the provision of Article 7  about removal of slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=James W. |last=Ely Jr. |title=The Guardian of Every Other Right: A Constitutional History of Property Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBXuRfB4DH4C&pg=PA35 |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=35 |isbn=978-0199724529}}</ref>\n\nThe actual [[geography of North America]] turned out not to match the details used in the treaty. The Treaty specified a southern boundary for the United States, but the separate Anglo-Spanish agreement did not specify a northern boundary for Florida, and the Spanish government assumed that the boundary was the same as in the 1763 agreement by which they had first given their territory in Florida to Britain. While that [[West Florida Controversy]] continued, Spain used its new control of Florida to block American access to the Mississippi, in defiance of Article 8.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFyLOUrdGFwC&pg=PA23 |title=Crucible of Power: A History of American Foreign Relations to 1913 |first=Howard |last=Jones |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8420-2916-2 |page=23}}</ref> The treaty stated that the boundary of the United States extended from the \"[[Northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods|most northwesternmost point]]\" of the [[Lake of the Woods]] (now partly in Minnesota, partly in Manitoba, and partly in Ontario) directly westward until it reached the Mississippi River.  But in fact the Mississippi does not extend that far northward; the line going west from the Lake of the Woods never intersects the river.\n\nGreat Britain violated the treaty stipulation that they should relinquish control of forts in United States territory \"with all convenient speed.\" British troops remained stationed at six forts in the [[Great Lakes region]], plus two at the north end of [[Lake Champlain]]. The British also built an additional fort in present-day Ohio in 1794, during the [[Northwest Indian War]]. They found justification for these actions in the unstable and extremely tense situation that existed in the area following the war, in the failure of the United States government to fulfill commitments made to compensate loyalists for their losses, and in the British need for time to liquidate various assets in the region.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu0hgVoIj3UC&pg=PA17 |title=Historic Fort York, 1793\u20131993 |first=Carl |last=Benn |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-920474-79-2 |page=17}}</ref> All posts were relinquished peacefully through diplomatic means as a result of the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]].
