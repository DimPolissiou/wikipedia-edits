He is a former [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]] (1992\u20132000) of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]].\n\nAfter a successful career in commercial television, initially  at [[Granada Television]] and later at [[London Weekend Television]], Birt was appointed Deputy Director-General of the BBC in 1987 for his expertise in [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]]. The forced departure of Director-General [[Alasdair Milne]] after pressure from the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government<ref>Alasdair Milne, ''DG: The Memoirs of a British Broadcaster'', 1988</ref> required someone near the top, preferably from outside the BBC, with editorial and production experience (Milne had been summarily replaced by [[Michael Checkland]], an [[accountant]]).\n\nDuring his tenure as Director-General, Birt restructured the BBC, in the face of much internal opposition. However, others have credited him with saving the corporation from possible government privatisation, and say he prepared for the era of [[digital broadcasting]]. After leaving the BBC, Birt was Strategic Advisor to [[Tony Blair|Prime Minister Tony Blair]] from 2001\u20135. He was appointed Chairman of CPA Global in 2015.\n\n==Early life and commercial television career==\nBirt was born in [[Liverpool]] (then in [[Lancashire]]) to a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] father, a manager at the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tyre company, and a [[Protestant]] mother. He was raised as a Catholic, and educated at the [[direct-grant grammar school]] [[St Mary's College, Liverpool]] and read [[engineering]] at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]], graduating from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] with a [[third-class degree]] in engineering.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Birt worked for [[Granada Television]], where he devised and produced the magazine programme ''Nice Time'' before joining Granada's ''[[World in Action]]'' current affairs series. Birt persuaded [[Mick Jagger]], who had just spent three nights in Brixton prison for possession of drugs, to participate in a 1967 edition of ''World in Action'' in which Jagger conversed with the editor of ''[[The Times]]'' ([[William Rees-Mogg]]) and the [[Bishop of Woolwich]] ([[John A. T. Robinson]]), among others. It was hailed as a \"dialogue between generations.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/john-birt-the-return-of-mr-blue-sky-760599.html|title= John Birt: The return of Mr Blue Sky | location=London | work=The Independent|date=27 November 2007}}</ref> With [[Gus Macdonald, Baron Macdonald of Tradeston|Gus Macdonald]], Birt became joint editor of ''World in Action'' in 1969.\n\nBirt moved from Granada to [[London Weekend Television]] in 1971. At LWT he was the founding editor and executive producer of the current affairs programme ''[[Weekend World]]''. He became head of current affairs at LWT and, later, controller of features and current affairs. With ''Weekend World'' presenter [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Birt contributed a series of three articles to ''[[The Times]]'' on the topic of television journalism. They argued that most television news and current affairs contained a \"bias against understanding\": pictures had taken precedence over analysis. Instead they advocated \"a mission to explain\". Makers of news and documentary programmes were required to outline their finished product in writing before setting out with a camera crew. Such an argument, was not universally accepted. Years later, in 2006, [[Alasdair Milne]], the former BBC Director General, said he thought Birt's \"bias against understanding\" argument was nonsense.<ref name=\"Snoddy\">{{cite news|last=Snoddy|first=Raymond|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/knives-are-out-for-the-bbc-bosses-6112266.html|title=Knives are out for the BBC bosses|work=The Independent|date=9 January 2006|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, he took a break from LWT to produce [[David Frost]]'s ''[[The Nixon Interviews]]'' with the disgraced former US President [[Richard Nixon]]. In the 1977 interviews, watched by 45 million people, Nixon admitted his part in the scandal which had led to his resignation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4588233.stm|title= Profile Sir David Frost | work=BBC News | date=24 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nBirt returned to LWT as director of programmes in 1982. During this period he revived the career of his old friend, the Liverpool singer [[Cilla Black]], who in due course became the highest-paid female performer on UK television. Birt formed a close working relationship with his boss at LWT, [[Michael Grade]], although this would later sour when both were working at the BBC.<ref name=\"auto\">John Birt,''The Harder Path'', 2002.</ref>\n\n==BBC career==\nBirt's success at LWT prompted the BBC's governors to appoint him deputy director-general in 1987 under [[Michael Checkland]]. Birt also served as the BBC's director of news and current affairs at this time.\n\nBirt's promotion to Director-General in 1992 caused controversy when it was revealed he was employed on a freelance consultancy basis. Under political and public pressure, Birt became a BBC employee. He had to sell his [[shares]] in [[LWT]], losing out on a windfall of what would have been several million pounds when it was bought by [[Granada plc|Granada]] in 1994. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' later revealed that Birt had been a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] at the time of his appointment, a concern to Conservatives who had already expressed concerns about alleged [[left-wing]] bias at the organisation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1793884.stm|title=A life through many lenses|work=BBC News|date=31 January 2002|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Director General, Birt was tasked with securing the BBC's future at a time of rapid technical, cultural and economic changes in world broadcasting.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/66695/John-Birt-Baron-Birt | title= John Birt Baron Birt | work=Britannica}}</ref>  In seven years, Birt restructured and modernised the corporation which he wanted to make \"the best managed public sector organisation\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Birt imposed a policy of radical change to deliver efficiency savings. In April 1993 he introduced Producer Choice, giving programme makers the power to buy services from outside the BBC. This theoretically reduced the cost to licence-payers of the BBC's historic resource base. Faced with high rental fees from the BBC's record library, producers found it cheaper to buy records from local record shops. In-house facilities were closed or stood idle, allegedly as a result of Birt's \"creative accounting\" methods.\n\nAbove all, Birt is credited with preparing the organisation for the new landscape shaped by digitalisation \u2013 preparations that were \"far in advance of the BBC\u2019s terrestrial rivals\", according to the academic [[Georgina Born]]. At the 1996 Edinburgh Television Festival, Birt said that without the resources to prepare for the digital age, the BBC would be \"history\".<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/894814.stm | title= BBC Challenges | work=BBC | location=London | date=25 August 2000 | accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref>Georgina Born (2005) ''Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the reinvention of the BBC''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-099-42893-8}}</ref>  Birt asserted that the changes made the BBC more agile, more competitive and allowed it to expand beyond its traditional broadcasting services, but remaining licence-fee funded. He was one of the driving forces behind the launch of continuous news output and he took much money from traditional services to fund the 24-hour news channel and advance on the internet.

Birt had first proposed the idea of the \"five-year plans\" in 2003 and was now responsible for overseeing the Third Term Plan. This included the overall policy programme, machinery of government changes and the legislative timetable. A special project team to develop the third term was led by Birt and Turnbull and reported regularly to the prime minister. Birt's team produced detailed proposals with a precise grid on how to implement policy.\n\nConcurrently, Birt served as an advisor at [[McKinsey & Company]]'s Global Media Practice from 2000\u20132005.

He is a former [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]] (1992\u20132000) of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]].\n\nAfter a successful career in commercial television, initially  at [[Granada Television]] and later at [[London Weekend Television]], Birt was appointed Deputy Director-General of the BBC in 1987 for his expertise in [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]]. The forced departure of Director-General [[Alasdair Milne]] after pressure from the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government<ref>Alasdair Milne, ''DG: The Memoirs of a British Broadcaster'', 1988</ref> required someone near the top, preferably from outside the BBC, with editorial and production experience (Milne had been summarily replaced by [[Michael Checkland]], an [[accountant]]).\n\nDuring his tenure as Director-General, Birt restructured the BBC, in the face of much internal opposition. However, others have credited him with saving the corporation from possible government privatisation, and say he prepared for the era of [[digital broadcasting]]. After leaving the BBC, Birt was Strategic Advisor to [[Tony Blair|Prime Minister Tony Blair]] from 2001\u20135. He was appointed Chairman of CPA Global in 2015.\n\n==Early life and commercial television career==\nBirt was born in [[Liverpool]] (then in [[Lancashire]]) to a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] father, a manager at the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tyre company, and a [[Protestant]] mother. He was raised as a Catholic, and educated at the [[direct-grant grammar school]] [[St Mary's College, Liverpool]] and read [[engineering]] at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]], graduating from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] with a [[third-class degree]] in engineering.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Birt worked for [[Granada Television]], where he devised and produced the magazine programme ''Nice Time'' before joining Granada's ''[[World in Action]]'' current affairs series. Birt persuaded [[Mick Jagger]], who had just spent three nights in Brixton prison for possession of drugs, to participate in a 1967 edition of ''World in Action'' in which Jagger conversed with the editor of ''[[The Times]]'' ([[William Rees-Mogg]]) and the [[Bishop of Woolwich]] ([[John A. T. Robinson]]), among others. It was hailed as a \"dialogue between generations.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/john-birt-the-return-of-mr-blue-sky-760599.html|title= John Birt: The return of Mr Blue Sky | location=London | work=The Independent|date=27 November 2007}}</ref> With [[Gus Macdonald, Baron Macdonald of Tradeston|Gus Macdonald]], Birt became joint editor of ''World in Action'' in 1969.\n\nBirt moved from Granada to [[London Weekend Television]] in 1971. At LWT he was the founding editor and executive producer of the current affairs programme ''[[Weekend World]]''. He became head of current affairs at LWT and, later, controller of features and current affairs. With ''Weekend World'' presenter [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Birt contributed a series of three articles to ''[[The Times]]'' on the topic of television journalism. They argued that most television news and current affairs contained a \"bias against understanding\": pictures had taken precedence over analysis. Instead they advocated \"a mission to explain\". Makers of news and documentary programmes were required to outline their finished product in writing before setting out with a camera crew. Such an argument, was not universally accepted. Years later, in 2006, [[Alasdair Milne]], the former BBC Director General, said he thought Birt's \"bias against understanding\" argument was nonsense.<ref name=\"Snoddy\">{{cite news|last=Snoddy|first=Raymond|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/knives-are-out-for-the-bbc-bosses-6112266.html|title=Knives are out for the BBC bosses|work=The Independent|date=9 January 2006|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, he took a break from LWT to produce [[David Frost]]'s ''[[The Nixon Interviews]]'' with the disgraced former US President [[Richard Nixon]].

During this period he revived the career of his old friend, the Liverpool singer [[Cilla Black]], who in due course became the highest-paid female performer on UK television. Birt formed a close working relationship with his boss at LWT, [[Michael Grade]], although this would later sour when both were working at the BBC.<ref name=\"auto\">John Birt,''The Harder Path'', 2002.</ref>\n\n==BBC career==\nBirt's success at LWT prompted the BBC's governors to appoint him deputy director-general in 1987 under [[Michael Checkland]]. Birt also served as the BBC's director of news and current affairs at this time.\n\nBirt's promotion to Director-General in 1992 caused controversy when it was revealed he was employed on a freelance consultancy basis. Under political and public pressure, Birt became a BBC employee. He had to sell his [[shares]] in [[LWT]], losing out on a windfall of what would have been several million pounds when it was bought by [[Granada plc|Granada]] in 1994. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' later revealed that Birt had been a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] at the time of his appointment, a concern to Conservatives who had already expressed concerns about alleged [[left-wing]] bias at the organisation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1793884.stm|title=A life through many lenses|work=BBC News|date=31 January 2002|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Director General, Birt was tasked with securing the BBC's future at a time of rapid technical, cultural and economic changes in world broadcasting.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/66695/John-Birt-Baron-Birt | title= John Birt Baron Birt | work=Britannica}}</ref>  In seven years, Birt restructured and modernised the corporation which he wanted to make \"the best managed public sector organisation\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Birt imposed a policy of radical change to deliver efficiency savings. In April 1993 he introduced Producer Choice, giving programme makers the power to buy services from outside the BBC. This theoretically reduced the cost to licence-payers of the BBC's historic resource base. Faced with high rental fees from the BBC's record library, producers found it cheaper to buy records from local record shops. In-house facilities were closed or stood idle, allegedly as a result of Birt's \"creative accounting\" methods.\n\nAbove all, Birt is credited with preparing the organisation for the new landscape shaped by digitalisation \u2013 preparations that were \"far in advance of the BBC\u2019s terrestrial rivals\", according to the academic [[Georgina Born]]. At the 1996 Edinburgh Television Festival, Birt said that without the resources to prepare for the digital age, the BBC would be \"history\".<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/894814.stm | title= BBC Challenges | work=BBC | location=London | date=25 August 2000 | accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref>Georgina Born (2005) ''Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the reinvention of the BBC''.

This included the overall policy programme, machinery of government changes and the legislative timetable. A special project team to develop the third term was led by Birt and Turnbull and reported regularly to the prime minister.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, a Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with 2 [[Singapore Police Force|Singapore police force officers]] in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, a Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with 2 [[Singapore Police Force|Singapore police force officers]] in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30.

This corrected an oversight in the law that meant that, while the Family Court could issue a Care Order for a child at risk of forced marriage or from a habitually drunk and violent father, it could not issue an Order for a child at risk of [[Female Genital Mutilation]]. The bill received unanimous backing in the House of Lords but, on reaching the House of Commons, where it was sponsored by [[Zac Goldsmith]], it was twice objected to by [[Christopher Chope]]. This led to national outrage, and several cabinet ministers condemned Chope's actions. Subsequently, first the Home Secretary and then the Prime Minister told parliament that they would find Government time for the Bill, which finally received Royal Assent on 15 March 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/08/tory-mp-who-blocked-upskirting-bill-halts-fgm-protection-law-christopher-chope | title = Tory MP who blocked upskirting bill halts FGM protection law | accessdate = 3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Compositions==\nBerkeley's compositions include an [[oboe]] concerto (1977), an [[oratorio]] ''Or Shall We Die?''

Orchestral works include ''Secret Garden'' (1997) and ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' (1998) plus concerti for clarinet, oboe, and 'cello. In 2000, Berkeley wrote his second opera, [[Jane Eyre (21st century opera)|''Jane Eyre'']] (libretto also by David Malouf), which was premiered at the [[Cheltenham Music Festival]] by [[Music Theatre Wales]] and subsequently toured around the UK. The original drafts for ''Jane Eyre'', representing one year's worth of work and the only copy of them, had been stolen from outside his London home in May 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/13/libbybrooks | title=Lost opera tragedy for composer | work=The Guardian | author=Libby Brooks | date=12 May 1999 | accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> The manuscripts were never recovered, and Berkeley re-composed the opera completely in one year's time, for performance at Cheltenham.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>\n\nIn October 2009, his [[chamber opera]] ''For You'', again with Ian McEwan as librettist, was premiered by Music Theatre Wales.

He also played in a rock band, Seeds of Discord.<ref name=\"Moss\"/> In his twenties, when he went to study with [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], he concentrated on composition.\n\n==Prizes and posts==\nIn 1977 he was awarded the Guinness Prize for Composition. In 1979, the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]] appointed Berkeley its associate composer. Berkeley was Composer-in-Association with the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from 2000 until 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/pdf/bio_now.pdf |format=PDF |title=BBC National Orchestra of Wales : Biography |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> He also acted as Visiting Professor in Composition at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama]] and was Artistic Director of the [[Cheltenham Music Festival]] from 1995 to 2004.

He is President of the Presteigne Festival of Music and is also a Vice-President of the Joyful Company of Singers.\n\n==Membership of the House of Lords==\nIn February 2013, it was announced that he would be made a [[life peer]] and enter the [[House of Lords]] as a [[crossbencher]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2013/february/lords-new-peers/| title = House of Lords, official website \u2013 New peers announced|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom| accessdate = 27 February 2013}}</ref> and on 26 March 2013 he was created Baron Berkeley of Knighton, of [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]] in the County of [[Powys]].<ref>{{London Gazette | issue=60462 |date=28 March 2013 |page=6195}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 Michael Berkeley successfully instigated and steered through the House of Lords an Amendment to the [[Children Act 1989]]. This corrected an oversight in the law that meant that, while the Family Court could issue a Care Order for a child at risk of forced marriage or from a habitually drunk and violent father, it could not issue an Order for a child at risk of [[Female Genital Mutilation]]. The bill received unanimous backing in the House of Lords but, on reaching the House of Commons, where it was sponsored by [[Zac Goldsmith]], it was twice objected to by [[Christopher Chope]]. This led to national outrage, and several cabinet ministers condemned Chope\u2019s actions. Subsequently first the Home Secretary and then the Prime Minister told parliament that they would find Government time for the Bill, which finally received Royal Assent on 15 March 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/08/tory-mp-who-blocked-upskirting-bill-halts-fgm-protection-law-christopher-chope | title = Tory MP who blocked upskirting bill halts FGM protection law | accessdate = 3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Compositions==\nBerkeley's compositions include an [[oboe]] concerto (1977), an [[oratorio]] ''Or Shall We Die?'' (libretto by [[Ian McEwan]]) (1982), ''Gethsemani Fragment'' (1990), ''[[Twenty-One (1991 film)|Twenty-One]]'' (1991), an opera ''Baa Baa Black Sheep'' (libretto by [[David Malouf]] based on the childhood of [[Rudyard Kipling]]) (1993). Orchestral works include ''Secret Garden'' (1997) and ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' (1998) plus concerti for clarinet, oboe, and 'cello. In 2000, Berkeley wrote his second opera, [[Jane Eyre (21st century opera)|''Jane Eyre'']] (libretto also by David Malouf), which was premiered at the [[Cheltenham Music Festival]] by [[Music Theatre Wales]] and subsequently toured around the UK. The original drafts for ''Jane Eyre'', representing one year's worth of work and the only copy of them, had been stolen from outside his London home in May 1999.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/13/libbybrooks | title=Lost opera tragedy for composer | work=The Guardian | author=Libby Brooks | date=12 May 1999 | accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> The manuscripts were never recovered, and Berkeley re-composed the opera completely in one year's time, for performance at Cheltenham.<ref name=\"Moss\"/>\n\nIn October 2009, his [[chamber opera]] ''For You'', again with Ian McEwan as librettist, was premiered by Music Theatre Wales.

Armstrong was educated at [[Bec School]] in [[Tooting]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. From 1938 to 1943, Armstrong worked for the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]].\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1943 to 1945 he was private secretary to the [[Secretary of the War Cabinet]] [[Edward Bridges, 1st Baron Bridges|Sir Edward Bridges]]. Between 1949 and 1953, he was [[principal private secretary]] to the three successive Chancellors of the Exchequer Sir [[Stafford Cripps]], [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and then [[R. A. Butler]].\n\nArmstrong was [[Under-Secretary]] to the Overseas Finance Division of the Treasury from 1953 to 1957, and from 1957 to 1958 of the Home Finance Division. Between 1958 and 1962, he was [[Third Secretary]] and Treasury Officer of Accounts. In 1962, he became [[Permanent Secretary to the Treasury]] and, in 1968, [[Head of the Home Civil Service]]. Due to his influence in [[Edward Heath]]'s government he was called the \"[[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]\".<ref name=\"ziegler20100509\"/> During its dispute with the miners over the government's imposition of a [[Three-Day Week]], however, Armstrong suffered a [[nervous breakdown]].<ref>[[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Donoughue, Bernard]] (03/09/2009). ''Downing Street Diary Volume Two. With James Callaghan in No. 10''. p.153. [[Pimlico (publishing imprint)|Pimlico]]. {{ISBN|978-1845950941}}</ref>\n\nHe returned to office after a period of sick leave but shortly after made known to his Second Permanent Secretary, [[Ian Bancroft, Baron Bancroft|Ian Bancroft]], that he had been approached to accept appointment as Chairman of the [[Midland Bank]]. There was internal discussion between Bancroft, the Cabinet Secretary, and the Prime Minister (by this time not Heath but [[Harold Wilson]]) as to the propriety of an official who was so close to the government's handling of economic affairs moving to the chairmanship of a clearing bank. Somewhat earlier the outgoing Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Anthony Barber]], had taken up the chairmanship of the Standard Chartered Bank. The Prime Minister decided that Armstrong had the right to accept the post, and he resigned from the Civil Service to do so. It is not true, as is sometimes stated, that Armstrong was replaced as head of the Civil Service.<ref name=\"ziegler20100509\">Ziegler, Philip. \"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7120484.ece How the last Tory-Liberal deal fell apart]\" ''The Sunday Times'', 9 May 2010.</ref>\n\n==Other work==\nHe was on the governing body of [[Abingdon School]] from 1980\u20131981.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/files/abingdonian/1980_June_V017_N004.pdf#page=7|title=Common Room Notes|publisher=The Abingdonian}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1945, Armstrong was made a [[Member of the Royal Victorian Order]] (MVO).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36866 |date=1 January 1945 |page=8 |supp=y}}</ref> He also was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1957,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=40960 |date=1 January 1957 |page=3 |supp=y}}</ref> promoted to a [[Knight Commander]] (KCB) in 1963<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43010 |date=8 June 1963 |page=4795 |supp=y}}</ref> and eventually a [[Knight Grand Cross]] (GCB) in 1968.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44600 |date=8 June 1968 |page=6301 |supp=y}}</ref> He was sworn in as a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1973.

Due to his influence in [[Edward Heath]]'s government he was called the \"[[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]\".<ref name=\"ziegler20100509\"/> During its dispute with the miners over the government's imposition of a [[Three-Day Week]], however, Armstrong suffered a [[nervous breakdown]].<ref>[[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Donoughue, Bernard]] (03/09/2009).

There was internal discussion between Bancroft, the Cabinet Secretary, and the Prime Minister (by this time not Heath but [[Harold Wilson]]) as to the propriety of an official who was so close to the government's handling of economic affairs moving to the chairmanship of a clearing bank. Somewhat earlier the outgoing Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Anthony Barber]], had taken up the chairmanship of the Standard Chartered Bank. The Prime Minister decided that Armstrong had the right to accept the post, and he resigned from the Civil Service to do so. It is not true, as is sometimes stated, that Armstrong was replaced as head of the Civil Service.<ref name=\"ziegler20100509\">Ziegler, Philip. \"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7120484.ece How the last Tory-Liberal deal fell apart]\" ''The Sunday Times'', 9 May 2010.</ref>\n\n==Other work==\nHe was on the governing body of [[Abingdon School]] from 1980-1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/files/abingdonian/1980_June_V017_N004.pdf#page=7|title=Common Room Notes|publisher=The Abingdonian}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1945, Armstrong was made a [[Member of the Royal Victorian Order]] (MVO).<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36866 |date=1 January 1945 |page=8 |supp=y}}</ref> He also was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in 1957,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=40960 |date=1 January 1957 |page=3 |supp=y}}</ref> promoted to a [[Knight Commander]] (KCB) in 1963<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43010 |date=8 June 1963 |page=4795 |supp=y}}</ref> and eventually a [[Knight Grand Cross]] (GCB) in 1968.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44600 |date=8 June 1968 |page=6301 |supp=y}}</ref> He was sworn in as a member of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1973.
