The battle was fought on 6 July 1782.<ref name=\"Castex269\">[[#Castex|Castex (2004)]], pp. 269\u2013272</ref> The battle was indecisive but Suffren was thwarted in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to [[Cuddalore]], while the British remained in control of Negapatam.<ref name=\"Fredriksen176\"/><ref name=\"Sweetman176\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process. [[Negapatam]] was [[Siege of Negapatam|sieged and taken]] by [[Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar|Sir Hector Munro]] in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]]. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive [[Battle of Sadras]]. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April [[Battle of Providien]], south of the [[Ceylon]]ese port of [[Trincomalee]], that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British [[Capture of Trincomalee|had captured]] in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of [[Batticaloa]].\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured [[Cuddalore]] on 6 May. [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at [[Vandavasi]]. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve [[ships of the line]] and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:SouthIndia1794.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of a 1794 map of south India and Ceylon. Batticaloa is north of the southeastern point of Ceylon]]\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3&nbsp;pm when a [[squall]] took down the main and mizzen top masts of ''Ajax'', forcing her to drop out of his line. When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to ''Ajax'', and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, ''Ajax'' stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30&nbsp;am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. ''Flamand'' engaged ''Hero'' and ''Exeter'', ''Annibal'' engaged ''Isis'', ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' faced ''Burford'', and ''Brillant'' opposed ''Sultan'' while the two flagships, ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Superb'', did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where ''Sphinx'' and ''Monarca'' battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. ''Flamand'' took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. ''Brillant'' began to suffer under the fire of ''Sultan'', but Suffren managed to detach from ''H\u00e9ros'' to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1&nbsp;pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556>[[#Clowes|Clowes (Vol.III)]], p.556</ref> The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively ''Burford'', ''Sultan'', ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle''; the two French were ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' (third in line) and towards the rear of the line ''Brillant'', which was dismasted by this stage. ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' was engaged by ''Sultan'' and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while ''Brillant'' was fired on by ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle'', and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556/>\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2&nbsp;pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=John |title=Transactions in India |date=1786 |publisher=John Debrett |page=[https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog/page/n477 470] |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> \u2013 he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of ''Ajax'', of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', had started to [[striking the colors|strike his colors]] during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act.<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to [[Chennai|Madras]] for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] the Dutch Republic would cede Negapatam to Britain.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-

The battle was fought on 6 July 1782.<ref name=\"Castex269\">[[#Castex|Castex (2004)]], pp. 269\u2013272</ref> The battle was indecisive but Suffren was thwarted in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to [[Cuddalore]], while the British remained in control of Negapatam.<ref name=\"Fredriksen176\"/><ref name=\"Sweetman176\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process. [[Negapatam]] was [[Siege of Negapatam|sieged and taken]] by [[Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar|Sir Hector Munro]] in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]]. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive [[Battle of Sadras]]. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April [[Battle of Providien]], south of the [[Ceylon]]ese port of [[Trincomalee]], that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British [[Capture of Trincomalee|had captured]] in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of [[Batticaloa]].\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured [[Cuddalore]] on 6 May. [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at [[Vandavasi]]. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve [[ships of the line]] and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:SouthIndia1794.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of a 1794 map of south India and Ceylon. Batticaloa is north of the southeastern point of Ceylon]]\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3&nbsp;pm when a [[squall]] took down the main and mizzen top masts of ''Ajax'', forcing her to drop out of his line. When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to ''Ajax'', and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, ''Ajax'' stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30&nbsp;am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. ''Flamand'' engaged ''Hero'' and ''Exeter'', ''Annibal'' engaged ''Isis'', ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' faced ''Burford'', and ''Brillant'' opposed ''Sultan'' while the two flagships, ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Superb'', did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where ''Sphinx'' and ''Monarca'' battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. ''Flamand'' took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. ''Brillant'' began to suffer under the fire of ''Sultan'', but Suffren managed to detach from ''H\u00e9ros'' to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1&nbsp;pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556>[[#Clowes|Clowes (Vol.III)]], p.556</ref> The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively ''Burford'', ''Sultan'', ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle''; the two French were ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' (third in line) and towards the rear of the line ''Brillant'', which was dismasted by this stage. ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' was engaged by ''Sultan'' and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while ''Brillant'' was fired on by ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle'', and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556/>\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2&nbsp;pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=John |title=Transactions in India |date=1786 |publisher=John Debrett |page=[https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog/page/n477 470] |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> &ndash; he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of ''Ajax'', of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', had started to [[striking the colors|strike his colors]] during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act.<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to [[Chennai|Madras]] for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] the Dutch Republic would cede Negapatam to Britain.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-

{"title_page": "ASSISTments", "text_new": "{{speedy deletion-advertising}}\n\nASSISTments is an [[educational technology]] platform that provides assistance to students in the form of immediate feedback and assessment data to teachers in order to support student learning. It was developed at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (WPI) with the goal of both providing a tool for teachers as well as an [[open science]] platform for researchers. ASSISTments is offered to teachers and students free of charge.\n\n== History of ASSISTments ==\n\n=== The ASSISTments Project @ WPI ===\nThe ASSISTments platform\u2019s development began in the early 2000\u2019s at WPI with a grant from the [[Institute of Education Sciences|Institute of Educational Sciences]]. The idea for the platform originated with [[Neil Heffernan]], a professor of computer science at WPI, where he is also the director of the Learning Sciences & Technologies program. Along with his wife, Cristina Heffernan, a former middle school math teacher, Neil Heffernan continues to lead The ASSISTments Project @ WPI.\n\n=== The ASSISTments Foundation ===\nIn 2019, Worcester Polytechnic Institute sponsored the incorporation of a non-profit organization called The ASSISTments Foundation to grow and scale ASSISTments to K-12 classrooms across the United States. The ASSISTments Foundation is led by CEO Megan Roberts and Neil Heffernan serves as President of the Board of Directors. Both The ASSISTments Foundation and the ASSISTments Project @ WPI work collaboratively on the evolution and expansion of the ASSISTments platform.\n\n== How it Works ==\nASSISTments is an online learning platform that provides students with immediate feedback and teachers with assessment data to inform classroom instruction. The tool\u2019s design and development is informed by learning science research. ASSISTments has a vast library of mathematics content, including [[Open educational resources|Open Educational Resources]] such as Illustrative Mathematics, EngageNY and [[OpenUP|OpenUp Resources]], textbook materials, state test practice and pre-built problem sets, as well as a builder where teachers can contribute self-authored content. \n\nTeachers can assign problems to students by either selecting a pre-built problem set or writing their own set of questions. As students complete their assignments, they receive automatic feedback on their answers. The tool provides teachers with Assignment Reports, which detail how the class and individual students performed on each problem and data insights to inform instruction. Teachers can access detailed data including common wrong answers for each problem or how many attempts it took each student before they arrived at the correct answer. ASSISTments works with [[Google Classroom]] and [[Instructure#Canvas|Canvas]]. \n\n== Learning Science Research Projects ==\nThe ASSISTments Project @ WPI also hosts [https://www.neilheffernan.net/publications E-TRIALS], an infrastructure that supports [[Experiment|experimental research]] with online student problem solving. The project seeks not just to improve the ASSISTments platform iteratively, but also to contribute to the science of online support.

It was developed at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (WPI) with the goal of both providing a tool for teachers as well as an [[open science]] platform for researchers. ASSISTments is offered to teachers and students free of charge.\n\n== History of ASSISTments ==\n\n=== The ASSISTments Project @ WPI ===\nThe ASSISTments platform\u2019s development began in the early 2000\u2019s at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) with a grant from the [[Institute of Education Sciences|Institute of Educational Sciences]]. The idea for the platform originated with [[Neil Heffernan]] a professor of computer science at WPI, where he is also the director of the Learning Sciences & Technologies program. Along with his wife, Cristina Heffernan, a former middle school math teacher, Neil Heffernan continues to lead The ASSISTments Project @ WPI.\n\n=== The ASSISTments Foundation ===\nIn 2019, Worcester Polytechnic Institute sponsored the incorporation of a non-profit organization called The ASSISTments Foundation to grow and scale ASSISTments to K-12 teachers across the United States. The ASSISTments Foundation is led by CEO Megan Roberts and Neil Heffernan serves as President of the Board of Directors. Both The ASSISTments Foundation and the ASSISTments Project @ WPI work collaboratively on the evolution and expansion of the ASSISTments platform.\n\n== How it Works ==\nASSISTments is an online learning platform that provides students with immediate feedback and teachers with assessment data to inform classroom instruction. The tool\u2019s design and development is informed by learning science research. ASSISTments has a vast library of mathematics content, including [[Open educational resources|Open Educational Resources]] such as Illustrative Mathematics, EngageNY and [[OpenUP|OpenUp Resources]]; textbook materials; state test practice and pre-built problem sets, as well as a builder where teachers can contribute self-authored content. \n\nTeachers can assign problems to students by either selecting a pre-built problem set or writing their own set of questions. As students complete their assignments, they receive automatic feedback on their answers. The tool provides teachers with Assignment Reports, which detail how the class and individual students performed on each problem and data insights to inform instruction. Teachers can access detailed data including common wrong answers for each problem or how many attempts it took each student before they arrived at the correct answer. ASSISTments works with [[Google Classroom]] and [[Instructure#Canvas|Canvas]]. \n\n== Learning Science Research Projects ==\nThe ASSISTments Project @ WPI also hosts [https://www.neilheffernan.net/publications E-TRIALS], an infrastructure that supports [[Experiment|experimental research]] with online student problem solving. The project seeks not just to improve the ASSISTments platform iteratively, but also to contribute to the science of online support.

The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

Evidence that this unit was in widespread use across southern Britain is available from the [[Folkton Drums]] from  [[Yorkshire]] ([[neolithic]] artifacts, made from chalk, with circumferences that exactly divide as [[integers]] into ten long feet) and a similar object, the [[Lavant drum]], excavated at [[Lavant, West Sussex|Lavant]], Sussex, again with a circumference divisible as a whole number into ten long feet.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Teather |first1=Anne |display-authors=etal|title=Getting the Measure of Stonehenge |journal=[[British Archaeology]] |date=8 February 2019 |issue=165 |pages=48\u201351}}</ref>\n\nThe measures of [[Iron Age Britain]] are uncertain and proposed reconstructions such as the [[Megalithic Yard]] are controversial.

The Belgic or North German foot of 335&nbsp;mm (13.2&nbsp;inches) was introduced to England either by the [[Belgae|Belgic Celts]] during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the 5th and 6th century.\n\n[[Roman units]] were introduced following [[Roman conquest of England|their invasion]] in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;43. The [[Roman foot]] had been previously standardized by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] at around 296&nbsp;mm or 11.65&nbsp;inches. Following the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman withdrawal]] and [[Saxon invasion of England|Saxon invasions]], the Roman foot continued to be used in the construction crafts while the Belgic foot was used for land measurement. Both the Welsh and Belgic feet seem to have been based on multiples of the [[barleycorn (unit)|barleycorn]], but by as early as 950 the English kings seem to have (ineffectually) ordered measures to be based upon an iron yardstick at [[Winchester]] and then [[London]].

Later [[Welsh legend]] credited [[Dyfnwal Moelmud]] with the establishment of [[Welsh units|their units]], including a foot of 9 inches. The Belgic or North German foot of 335&nbsp;mm (13.2&nbsp;inches) was introduced to England either by the [[Belgae|Belgic Celts]] during their invasions prior to the Romans or by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the 5th and 6th century.\n\n[[Roman units]] were introduced following [[Roman conquest of England|their invasion]] in {{sc|ad}}&nbsp;43.

(See '[[minute]]' for another case where prime and double prime symbols are used to denote first and second cuts in refining measurement.)\n\n=== Pre-1959 ===\nIn the United States, the foot was defined as 12&nbsp;inches, with the inch being defined by the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893 by 39.37&nbsp;inches&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;m. In [[Imperial units]], the foot was defined as {{frac|1|3}}&nbsp;yard, with the yard being realized as a physical standard (separate from the standard meter).\n\nThe yard standards of the different [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries were periodically compared with one another.<ref>See, for example, ''Report on the Comparisons of the Parliamentary Copies of the Imperial Standards with the Imperial Standard Yard and the Imperial Standard Pound and with each other during the Years 1947 to 1948'' (H.M.S.O., London, 1950).

The small difference between the survey and the international foot would not be detectable on a survey of a small parcel, but becomes significant for mapping, or when the [[State Plane Coordinate System|state plane coordinate system]] (SPCS) is used in the US, because the origin of the system may be hundreds of thousands of feet (hundreds of miles) from the point of interest. Hence the previous definitions continued to be used for surveying in the United States and India for many years, and are denoted '''survey feet''' to distinguish them from the international foot. The United Kingdom was unaffected by this problem, as the [[retriangulation of Great Britain]] (1936\u201362) had been done in meters.\n\n====US survey foot{{anchor|United States survey foot}}====\nThe United States survey foot is defined as exactly {{frac|1200|3937}}&nbsp;meters, approximately {{val|0.304800609601|u=m}}.<ref>A.

The film was screened at the Casablanca Film Festival. The rights of this film now belong to Shah Rukh Khan's [[Red Chillies Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in a bowling alley, where a group of friends are awaiting the arrival of Salim. Meanwhile, Deepak arrives with his fianc\u00e9e Sheetal. When a conversation about love arises, Deepak and the rest find it necessary to make Sheetal aware that true love does exist. They tell her the story of Raj ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) and Priya ([[Rani Mukerji]]), two of their closest friends. Raj Mathur is the owner of Raj Transport, a small trucking company he founded himself. Raj is a carefree man who is unorganised, messy, lazy and late all the time. Although he isn't the richest, he's always happy.\n\nOn the other hand, Priya Chopra is a successful fashion designer whose family is quite wealthy. Priya, originally from [[Greece]], lives with her aunt Anna, who wants to give her the best in life (wealth and success). Priya has her life all planned out&nbsp;\u2013 the complete opposite of Raj. These two completely different people meet in a car accident, when Priya crashes her car into Raj's truck. Though the two get off to a rocky start, they meet again at the wedding of Salim and Farah, eventually becoming friends. The two arrange to meet again and slowly fall in love. Raj receives Priya's phone number but carelessly loses it. He then sets out to find her and he does find her.\n\nHowever, Raj learns that Priya's engaged. Desperate, he follows Priya to Greece, where he continues to woo her. When it's time to part company, Priya realises that she is in love with Raj. They get married after persuading Priya's parents, and arrive in [[Mumbai]], where Raj welcomes Priya into their home. He then makes an oath to his holy talisman, wishing it to protect Priya if he is not around, because he loves her immensely.\n\nBack to the bowling alley in the present: Sheetal is in tears, for she has never heard a more beautiful story. Salim arrives along with Farah and announce that today was Raj and Priya's first wedding anniversary, so they were planning a surprise party. Excited, Sheetal can't wait to meet the famous Raj and Priya, but when they do arrive, they're nothing like what they seemed. A year has changed both Raj and Priya, and the two can't stop arguing. When they do find some common ground and happiness, it doesn't last long. Raj feels the pressure to meet the expectations of Priya's family, and is struggling financially. His company has gone bankrupt, and he has many bills and loans to pay. When he is insulted by a bank official, he returns home crying.\n\nPriya cannot stand to see her husband in this state, and resorts to asking her former fianc\u00e9 for money. When Raj asks her about the source of money, she lies. But when he throws a celebration party, he learns the truth. Angry at Priya, he becomes destructive, and Priya, heartbroken, runs away to her parents. Raj, realizing his error, goes after Priya, only to be insulted by her family. Priya decides to leave for [[Greece]] because she can't stay with Raj but can't stay without him. When Raj is informed of this, he races to the airport to stop Priya, just as he did the year before. He says he will change and that he has a dream of the two of them starting a family together. Although Priya expresses that she has the same dream, she feels it is impossible for them to be together, so she boards the plane. Giving up, Raj remembers his oath and sends his talisman to Priya. When Priya receives the talisman, she too recalls Raj's confession. Raj returns home to find Priya waiting for him. She says that the only way to make their dream come true is to be together. In a playful manner, the two get into another argument but they say that this is how they express their love. They continue to argue as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj Mathur\n* [[Rani Mukerji]] as Priya Chopra (named Mathur after getting married to Raj)\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Manubhai\n* [[Lilette Dubey]] as Anna Mausi, Priya's aunt\n* [[Johny Lever]] as Nandu, a roadside drunkard\n* [[Jas Arora]] as Sameer, Priya's former fianc\u00e9\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as a Friend\n* Suresh Bhagwat as a Dhobi\n* [[Aditya Pancholi]] as a Hostile businessman\n* Dinyar Tirandaz as Irani\n* [[Rajeev Verma]] as Mr. Chopra\n* [[Jayshree T.]] as Mrs. Manubhai\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as a Shopkeeper\n* Masood Akhtar as a Paanwala\n* Gagan Gupta as Tambi\n* [[Vani Tripathi]] as a Friend\n* Sushmita Daan as a Flower girl\n* [[Arun Singh]] as a Vegetable seller\n* Akhtar Nawaz as a Milkman\n* Kamini Khanna as Female plane passenger\n* [[Bobby Darling]] as a Friend\n* Madhavi Chopra as a Friend\n* Ashish Kapoor\n* [[Jameel Khan]] as a Traffic Policeman\n\n==Development==\nThis was the third film produced by Shahrukh Khan and [[Juhi Chawla]]'s a company, [[Dreamz Unlimited]].\nMovie publicity strategy created by Kanchana Kodituwakku and [[Dreamz Unlimited]]company.\n\nFilming took place in India and Greece.

Meanwhile, Deepak arrives with his fianc\u00e9e Sheetal. When a conversation about love arises, Deepak and the rest find it necessary to make Sheetal aware that true love does exist. They tell her the story of Raj ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) and Priya ([[Rani Mukerji]]), two of their closest friends. Raj Mathur is the owner of Raj Transport, a small trucking company he founded himself. Raj is a carefree man who is unorganised, messy, lazy and late all the time. Although he isn't the richest, he's always happy.\n\nOn the other hand, Priya Chopra is a successful fashion designer whose family is quite wealthy. Priya, originally from [[Greece]], lives with her aunt Anna, who wants to give her the best in life (wealth and success). Priya has her life all planned out&nbsp;\u2013 the complete opposite of Raj. These two completely different people meet in a car accident, when Priya crashes her car into Raj's truck. Though the two get off to a rocky start, they meet again at the wedding of Salim and Farah, eventually becoming friends. The two arrange to meet again and slowly fall in love. Raj receives Priya's phone number but carelessly loses it. He then sets out to find her and he does find her.\n\nHowever, Raj learns that Priya's engaged. Desperate, he follows Priya to Greece, where he continues to woo her. When it's time to part company, Priya realises that she is in love with Raj. They get married after persuading Priya's parents, and arrive in [[Mumbai]], where Raj welcomes Priya into their home. He then makes an oath to his holy talisman, wishing it to protect Priya if he is not around, because he loves her immensely.\n\nBack to the bowling alley in the present: Sheetal is in tears, for she has never heard a more beautiful story. Salim arrives along with Farah and announce that today was Raj and Priya's first wedding anniversary, so they were planning a surprise party. Excited, Sheetal can't wait to meet the famous Raj and Priya, but when they do arrive, they're nothing like what they seemed. A year has changed both Raj and Priya, and the two can't stop arguing. When they do find some common ground and happiness, it doesn't last long. Raj feels the pressure to meet the expectations of Priya's family, and is struggling financially. His company has gone bankrupt, and he has many bills and loans to pay. When he is insulted by a bank official, he returns home crying.\n\nPriya cannot stand to see her husband in this state, and resorts to asking her former fianc\u00e9 for money. When Raj asks her about the source of money, she lies. But when he throws a celebration party, he learns the truth. Angry at Priya, he becomes destructive, and Priya, heartbroken, runs away to her parents. Raj, realizing his error, goes after Priya, only to be insulted by her family. Priya decides to leave for [[Greece]] because she can't stay with Raj but can't stay without him. When Raj is informed of this, he races to the airport to stop Priya, just as he did the year before. He says he will change and that he has a dream of the two of them starting a family together. Although Priya expresses that she has the same dream, she feels it is impossible for them to be together, so she boards the plane. Giving up, Raj remembers his oath and sends his talisman to Priya. When Priya receives the talisman, she too recalls Raj's confession. Raj returns home to find Priya waiting for him. She says that the only way to make their dream come true is to be together. In a playful manner, the two get into another argument but they say that this is how they express their love. They continue to argue as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj Mathur\n* [[Rani Mukerji]] as Priya Chopra (named Mathur after getting married to Raj)\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Manubhai\n* [[Lilette Dubey]] as Anna Mausi, Priya's aunt\n* [[Johny Lever]] as Nandu, a roadside drunkard\n* [[Jas Arora]] as Sameer, Priya's former fianc\u00e9\n* [[Vishwajeet Pradhan]] as a Friend\n* Suresh Bhagwat as a Dhobi\n* [[Aditya Pancholi]] as a Hostile businessman\n* Dinyar Tirandaz as Irani\n* [[Rajeev Verma]] as Mr. Chopra\n* [[Jayshree T.]] as Mrs. Manubhai\n* [[Suresh Menon]] as a Shopkeeper\n* Masood Akhtar as a Paanwala\n* Gagan Gupta as Tambi\n* [[Vani Tripathi]] as a Friend\n* Sushmita Daan as a Flower girl\n* [[Arun Singh]] as a Vegetable seller\n* Akhtar Nawaz as a Milkman\n* Kamini Khanna as Female plane passenger\n* [[Bobby Darling]] as a Friend\n* Madhavi Chopra as a Friend\n* Ashish Kapoor\n* [[Jameel Khan]] as a Traffic Policeman\n\n==Development==\nThis was the third film produced by Shahrukh Khan and [[Juhi Chawla]]'s a company, [[Dreamz Unlimited]].\nMovie publicity strategy created by Kanchana Kodituwakku and [[Dreamz Unlimited]]company.\n\nFilming took place in India and Greece.

This particular type of Mini 4WD uses horizontal side rollers to guide the vehicle along the vertical walls of the un-banked track for steering, providing speeds from 14 to 65&nbsp;km/H<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbMiEltAxsc YouTube Video Info on Mini 4WD Speed]</ref> (9 to 40&nbsp;mph) on the track.

Later, from 1983 to 1986, a smaller version of Stomper was distributed in McDonald's Happy Meals.<ref>[http://collections.mnhs.org/cms/display.php?irn=10138492&return=brand%3Dcms%26count%3D25%26displaymode%3Dlist%26q%3Dstomper%26sort%3Ddesc Minnesota Historical Society]</ref> A multitude of replicas produced by other companies led to lengthy lawsuits, and eventually the company sold the product to Tyco, after which, sales declined.\n\nThe original [[Schaper Toys]] Stomper / [[Stompers (toy)]] vehicles of 1980 and subsequent Tamiya replicas of 1982 were heavily influenced by the worldwide craze for 4WD vehicles that started in 1979 with the inaugural running of the Paris [[Dakar Rally]] in 1979, which is evidenced by the particular make of those models. The first Shaper model vehicles produced in 1980 were the [[Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] pickup trucks. The first Tamiya replicas produced in 1982 were the [[Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] pickup trucks.\n\nIn 1982, a [[Japan]]ese company, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]], produced their own replica versions of the 1/32 scale [[Schaper Toys]] Stomper / [[Stompers (toy)]] that utilized worm gears and spur gears.\n\nAlso, in 1982, Tamiya mini 4WD kits were sold by Model Rectifier Corp (MRC), the exclusive U.S. Distributor of Tamiya.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qCesmPpziF4C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=tamiya+model+rectifier+corp&source=bl&ots=-aJx1cF3Mh&sig=2mfoJ0mvMX7071C-_-umXpSzqgs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LKnIUqvXKc2JogTkh4KwDA&sqi=2&ved=0CGAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=tamiya%20model%20rectifier%20corp&f=false The Legal and Economic Aspects of Gray Market Goods By Seth E.

MRC continued to sell Mini 4WD kits until at least 1990, which may be the year their Tamiya license expired.\n\nIn 1986, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced their 4WD Mini Racer (\u30df\u30cb\u56db\u99c6) series as a powered variant of their plastic automobile model kits. Interestingly, these highly modifiable racing model kits are larger at 1/30 scale, although still marketed as 1/32 scale. Due to the nature of these model kits being highly modifiable, racing and tuning up Mini 4WD cars has become a [[hobby]] for people across the world.<ref>[http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=mini+4wd#q=mini%204wd&cmpt=q Current Google Trends for Mini 4WD]</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Tamiya commissioned [[Shogakukan]], a Japanese publishing company, to produce two [[anime]] television series based on the Mini 4WD cars: [[Dash!

Yonkuro. This category of racing grew into a worldwide success by 2017 and continues to grow in recognition and participation.<ref>[http://streetmini4wdhome.altervista.org/history/ Street Mini 4WD]</ref> \n\nIn 1999, Tamiya Japan temporarily suspended the ''Great Japan Cup'' national championships for Mini 4WD racers.\n\nBy the 2000s, at least twenty-eight (28) other companies had ventured into the Mini 4WD market, and famously included [[Tokyo Marui]], [[Kyosho]], [[Academy Plastic Model|Academy]], Auldey Animation and Toys<ref>https://auldeytoys.nl/en/</ref>, [[Circuit no \u014ckami]], [[Aoshima Bunka Kyozai]], [[Matchbox (brand)]], [[Revell]], [[Hot Wheels]], [[Tonka]], [[Hasbro]], and [[Bandai]].

After a brief lull, there was a sudden resurgence of the popularity of the hobby in the [[Philippines]] in the last half of 2018, where racing tournaments happened almost every weekend.\n\nThe World Endurance Championship was first run in 2012 as a replacement for the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup and has increased its influence on Mini 4WD ever since.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, Tamiya produced several kits based on [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] (WEC) cars, including LMP1, LMP2, GT1, GT2, GT3 and GT4 classes. The LMP1 and LMP2 models were based on the 2012 [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]], the 2014 [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]] and the 2016 [[Toyota TS050 Hybrid]].\n\nAccording to [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]], the world record for Longest Mini 4WD Track was created on\n3 November 2019 at 3,191.58 meters at Amagi Dome in Izu, Shizuoka, Japan.<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-8000/longest-mini-4wd-race-track/ Guinness World Record for Mini 4WD]</ref>\n\n===Longest Mini 4WD Track World Records===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!

For example; Circuit Sprint Racing, Circuit Endurance Racing and Street Racing are categories. \n\nWithin the Circuit Sprint Racing category, there are many classes, such as Japan Cup, F-1 Series, Box Stock, Stock, Modified, Open, Technical, Speed-Technical, Semi-Speed Long Jump and Drag Racing. \n\nWithin the Circuit Endurance Racing category, there are many classes, such as LMP1, LMP2, LMGTE Pro, LMGTE AM, GT1, GT2, GT3, TCE and more. \n\nWithin the Street Racing category,  there are 2 classes, such as Normal and Wild. Within each class of racing there may be many types, where the types differ by minor modifications according to each host's own decision.\n\n===Circuit Sprint Racing===\n\nCircuit Sprint racing is where the cars usually run on a 2, 3 or 5-lane track made of plastic or wood. Due to the nature of the lane-changing mechanism and for the purpose of cycling through a multitude of participants, a 2-lane race lasts 2 laps, a 3-lane race lasts 3 laps and a 5-lane race lasts 5 laps. Typical sprint track circuit lengths are usually between 20 and 200 meters. At an average track speed of 20 kilometers per hour, a car is able to finish the entire race in 3.6 to 36 seconds, respectively.\n\n===Circuit Endurance Racing===\n\nCircuit Endurance racing is where the cars usually run on a 1, 2, 3 or 5-lane track made of plastic or wood. Due to the nature of endurance racing, the minimum length of time for an endurance race is one (1) hour. Typical endurance track circuit lengths are usually between 200 and 2,000 meters. At an average top track speed of 20 kilometers per hour, a car is able to complete 20,000 meters per hour. Thus, during a four (4) hour race, a car may complete 80,000 meters. The longest endurance race is 24-hours where a car may complete 480,000 meters in that time. That is equivalent to 480 kilometers or 298.3 miles.\n\n===Off Road===\n\nOff Road is a category where the cars run on the street, parking lot, sidewalk, grass, gravel, sand or other ground, including RC tracks, without the use of a standard plastic Mini 4WD track circuit. \n\nOff Road drivers follow their respective cars, on foot, using a guide stick, much like a hockey player would use, to maneuver their car left or right through the race course.\n\nThe Off Road Mini 4WD races are based on the races that were represented in the manga and anime ''Dash! Yonkuro'' and the ongoing'' Hyper Dash! Yonkuro''.\n\nAs of 2020, the two main communities that organise events in this category are \u201cMini 4WD Sport\u201d and \u201cStreet Mini 4WD\u201d.\n\n==Generations (1980)==\n\n'''Stomper 4x4s''' was the first official mini 4wd, created on February 14, 1980, by Adolph Eddy Goldfarb<ref>http://www.google.com/patents/US4306375 United States Patent Office for Stomper</ref> and sold by [[Schaper Toys]]. These toys were battery-powered vehicles that ran on a single [[AA battery]] and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that turned both axles. Of the first vehicles were a Ford Truck and a Chevrolet Truck.\n\n==Generations (1982)==\n\nIn 1982, Mini 4WD was produced by [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]]. These toys were battery-powered vehicles that ran on a pair of [[AA battery]] and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that turned both axles. Of the first vehicles were a Ford Truck and a Chevrolet Truck.\n\n==Generations (1986-1989)==\n* In 1986, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Racing Mini 4WD series starting with Hotshot Jr. and the Type-1 chassis. All Type-1 chassis kits were supplied with thick, big racing wheels and super slick spiked tires.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamiya.com/english/tamiya/tamiya_03.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929173915/http://www.tamiya.com/english/tamiya/tamiya_03.htm |archive-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Emperor and the Type-2 chassis were introduced. Like the Type-1 chassis kits, all Type-2 chassis kits also have spiked tires of the super slick type.\n* Vanquish Jr. and the Type-3 chassis with the standard large diameter tires and fin type wheels were introduced while the Type-2 Dash! Yonkuro cars were also re-released on the Type-3 with the same big racing wheels and smooth super slick tires.\n* In 1989, Crimson Glory was released with the FM chassis, this unique chassis had the motor placed on the front of the chassis which was believed to give the car an upslope and downhill balance.\n* In 1989, [[HASBRO]] released several versions of their [[Record Breakers: World of Speed]] series kits.<ref>[https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-11-21-8903110756-story.html Chicago Tribune]</ref> \n* And in 1990, the Manta Ray Jr. and the Zero chassis were produced.\n\n==Generations (1990-1999)==\n\n* In 1993, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Super Mini 4WD series starting with Liberty Emperor and the Super-1 chassis and it is the first series to only use the standard large diameter wheels and tires.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\"/>\n* In 1994, Strato Vector and the Super FM chassis were produced.\n* In 1994, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Fully Cowled Mini 4WD series starting with Magnum Saber on the Super-1 chassis and it is the first to have cars equipped with small diameter narrow wheels and tires.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\"/>\n* In 1995, Cyclone Magnum was released with the Super TZ chassis and wide thread wheels and tires.\n* In 1995, Black Stalker and the Super TZ chassis were produced.\n* In 1996, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced an Aero Mini 4WD series starting with Max Breaker and the Super X chassis. In the same year, a Mighty Mini 4WD series was produced starting with Dyna Hawk.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\"/>\n* Also in 1998, Lightning Magnum and the VS chassis were introduced.\n\n==Generations (2000-2009)==\n* In 2003, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced the R/C Mini 4WD series starting with Subaru Impreza WRC 2002 and the TR-1 chassis, a chassis that runs with a receiver unit and a single-button radio controller. As the cheapest alternative to actual R/C cars and [[slot car]]s, the receiver unit is removable to let the car freely run on the track with just the motor and batteries, there were also car component kits and unique tune-up parts produced. However, the R/C Mini 4WD cars' popularity were not widespread after its introduction and Tamiya continued making free-running Mini 4WDs.\n* In 2005, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced the Mini 4WD PRO series starting with Nitro Thunder and the MS chassis, a chassis run by a dual-axle motor and can be separated into three parts: a front N-unit, rear T-unit and the midship unit containing the motor and batteries.\n* In 2005, [[Bandai]] released Real Machines Series in collaboration with [[Toyota]].\n\n==Generations (2010-2019)==\n* In 2010, Tamiya produced the Super-II chassis as the successor to the Super-1 chassis with more compatibility with optional parts meant for other chassis and as such were originally sold as premium versions of their original counterparts. Later in 2011, Tamiya started producing new Mini 4WDs on this chassis starting with the Astute RS.\n* In 2012, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Mini 4WD REV series starting with Aero Avante and the AR chassis, this new chassis has improved aerodynamics, easy motor and battery removal without removing the body part and a monocoque design.\n* In 2013, Tamiya created the MA chassis series of cars as a subseries to the PRO series starting with Blast Arrow. The MA chassis combines the aerodynamics and monocoque aesthetics of the AR chassis and the inner structure aspects of the MS chassis.\n* In 2017, Tamiya produced the FM-A chassis as a subseries to the REV series starting with Rowdy Bull. The successor to the Super FM chassis, it combines the aerodynamics and the monocoque aesthetics of the AR chassis with the front-mounted motor of the FM and Super-FM chassis.\n\n==Generations (2020-2029)==\n* In 2020, Tamiya created the VZ chassis as the successor to the VS chassis with a removable front bumper like the MS chassis and a rear roller stay that can mount four rollers. First release of this VZ chassis was with the 18094 Neo-VQS which is a modernized version of the Vanquish Jr.\n\n== Mechanical Display & Corporate-Sponsored Mini 4WD Models (Tamiya) ==\n* In the late 1990s when Let's & Go!! MAX was aired on television in Japan, Tamiya produced a series of display model kits known as the ''Mechanical'' Mini 4WD series (stylized as Mini 4WD Mechanical). The cars in this series are static replicas of the mechanized cars shown in the anime itself and thus they cannot freely move unlike the actual Mini 4WDs.\n* Certain software, anime production companies and some regions in Japan also collaborated with Tamiya to merchandise the main and/or secondary characters of their anime, software mascots or even tourism icons for limited edition Mini 4WD kits through licensing as these companies believed that Mini 4WD is cheaper for them to invest in bulk quantities compared to R/C cars which are four to six times the price per kit in bulk.\n\n==Mini 4WD Design==\nIn a standard 4WD design, the separate four wheels are allowed to rotate at different speeds through the use of differentials. This is important for cornering to eliminate binding. In a Mini 4WD, this is not a standard design and is only achieved through optional one-way wheel sets. Thus, the standard Mini 4WD utilizes a direct drive to all 4 wheels even around corners. Chassis' are designed to hold the motor and batteries in differing arrangements. There are sideways motors positioned in the rear. There are sideways motors positions in the front. There are in-line motors positioned in the middle. \nRear and Front position motor designs position batteries side by side in the front or rear of the motor placement. Middle position motor designs position the batteries straddling either side of the motor. Rear and front position motor designs utilize a propeller rod extending from the main motor gear box that drives both the front and rear axles. Middle position motor design powers both the front and back wheels through separate gear boxes eliminating the need for such a propeller rod.\n\nChassis are designed with front bumpers, optional side and rear bumpers designed to hold guide rollers that interact with the track's 58mm high walls.\n\nThe body is designed from hard plastic or soft, transparent [[Polycarbonate]], known by the trademarked names [[Lexan]], for special or limited editions, which attaches with a catch-type lock at the back of the car, distinguishes one model from another.\n\n===Motors===\nThere are three specifications that characterize all motors: [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], [[torque]], and power-consumption.<ref>[https://www.tamiyausa.com/mini4wd-techtips/ Mini 4WD Motor Specs]</ref> RPM is the speed the motor provides, and the torque its strength. A higher RPM means higher maximum speed, higher torque gives more acceleration and allows the car to better withstand the difficulties of climbing slopes or running through turns.\n\nThe motor is one of the important components a mini 4WD racer need to make the car move, There are two types of motors: single-shaft or double-shaft motors.\n\n===Gears===\nDifferent types of gears have different ratios of rotation of the motor and the wheel, and they include  (3.5:1), (3:7:1), (4:1), (4.2:1), (5:1), and \"Special\" (ratio varies but are usually 6.4:1). The higher the ratio, the better the acceleration rate and torque; the lower the ratio, the better the maximum speed.<ref>[https://www.tamiyausa.com/mini4wd-techtips/ Mini 4WD Gearing Specifications]</ref>\n\n===Tires and Wheels===\nIt is recommended that, among the different wheels available, the compatible ones must maintain the same size as those from the assembly packet. The smaller the diameter of the wheel, the more stable it is, as the car's center of gravity is lowered. Although one can easily assume that a larger wheel suits a faster car the best, this is not at all the case. Large wheels are for cars with high gear ratio (i.e. \"5:1\") and weak motor; small wheels are for cars with low gear ratio and strong motor.<ref name=\"pokedream\">[http://mini4wd.pokedream.com/advice/wheels_tires/index.shtml Mini 4WD Extreme Info On Wheels]</ref> Wider wheels allow for more stability but suffer from friction, and thus, the loss of speed; thinner wheels are intended for speed, but the car could be susceptible to flipping off the track.\n\nThere are four types of different wheels: normal plastic, one-way, aluminum, and lock-nut.<ref name=\"pokedream\"/> Normal plastic wheels are fine, but they are not adequate for really fast cars. They become loose after disconnecting them from the axle several times. Additionally, they create drag when the car going through turns as the axle locks the two wheels at same speed, since the outer wheel must cover more distance than the inner wheel (relatively to the turn of the course). One-way wheels allow either side to roll faster than the other when turning, and minimize the speed loss in turns. Aluminum wheels are very light, sturdy, and best for speed. Some aluminum wheels have preventive measures against loosening with the axle. However, lock-nut wheels are the best in preventing the cars from losing the wheels during a run.\n\nThere are four types of tires: rubber, sponge, reston, and semi-pneumatic.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011116231135/http://www.geocities.com/alotstore/tips.html Mini 4WD Hobby Info On Tires]</ref> Rubber tires come as standard with the Mini 4WD, and, although it has good grip, it is heavy and is susceptible to slipping on wet surfaces. The alternate solution to the rubber tire are the reston or sponge tires, which are very light, have good grip, and are better suited for rainy days. Yet, these get dirty easily, and they tend to exhaust the motor.\n\n===Bumpers===\nBumpers are usually found at the opposite ends of the mini 4WD. Upgrading the bumper becomes a necessity as the mini 4WD is modified to run faster than what the stock kit usually runs. The faster the car, the more the car needs down force to counter the decrease in stability. The stock chassis+bumper combination does have a tendency to bend, causing the rollers to run at angles and may make the mini 4WD fly off the course. Aluminum, fiberglass, or carbon fiber plates are usually installed as after-market upgrades to prevent this from occurring. Another possible upgrade are the screws that keep the rollers to the bumper. Only Tamiya offers aluminum plates as upgrades.\n\nMost after-market upgrade plates are usually wider than the stock bumper, and they facilitate the installation of \"side extension\" plates that make the front profile of the mini 4WD even wider.\n\n===Rollers===\nRoller is the wheel that rests on either end of the mini car's bumper and glides against the wall of the course. This allows the car to change direction and maintain stability. Conventional roller will do fine on a car with average speed, but, on a much faster car, aluminum or ball-bearing rollers must be purchased to acquire additional downforce and stability. These rollers do not tilt in angle as the conventional plastic rollers, and, therefore, have better chance in preventing the car from flinging off the course. Ball-bearing rollers have small metal balls around the internal ring, on which the roller spins, in order to minimize friction. Some rollers consist of two rollers on a pole -one at the base and other at the top-, so that they may offer the best stability. There are three types of roller arrangements. The first one is in which all rollers are same-sized, and this is for straight courses. The second arrangement, in which larger rollers are stationed in the front, is less stable when running through corners but minimizes speed losses; the third arrangement, in which smaller rollers are put in the front, is more stable when running through corners but the car is more susceptible to speed losses as it pushes into the wall.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011116231135/http://www.geocities.com/alotstore/tips.html Mini 4WD Hobby Info On Rollers]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bakus\u014d Ky\u014ddai Let's & Go!!]] Popular [[anime]]/[[manga]] based on Mini 4WD\n*[[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]]\n*[[Racer Mini Yonku: Japan Cup]] - [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] video game\n*[[Record Breakers: World of Speed]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mini 4WD}}\n*[http://mini4wdrace.com Mini 4WD Community in United States]\n*[http://sns.prtls.jp/mini4wd/home.html Mini 4WD Community in Japan]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111209183232/http://www.tamiyamanila.org/ Mini 4WD Community in Philippines]\n*[http://www.oprekmini4wd.com Mini 4WD Community In Indonesia]\n*[http://www.fantasyland.it/tamiya/gare-mini4wd/ Mini 4WD Community In Italy]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/groups/2572783219655045 Mini 4WD Community In France]\n*[http://www.tcfans.org Mini 4WD Community In China]\n*[http://www.empressspeedway.com/ Mini 4WD Community In Hong Kong]\n*[http://mini4wd.pokedream.com Older, Yet Good Reference Site]\n*[http://www.mini-4wd.de Largest Mini 4WD Boxart Gallery & Historical Photos]\n*[http://www.pimentoso.com/mini4wd-track-editor/ Mini4WD Online Track Editor]\n{{scale model}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mini 4wd}}\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n[[Category:Tamiya Corporation]]\n[[Category:1980s toys]]\n[[Category:1990s toys]]\n[[Category:2000s toys]]\n[[Category:2010s toys]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{fansite|date=October 2018}}\n{{overly detailed|date=October 2018}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=October 2018}}\n}}\n[[Image:Stomperpullingsled.jpg|thumb|250px|1980 - FIRST STOMPER MINI 4WD]]\n[[File:Mini-4wd-first-trucks-1900.png|thumb|250px|1982 - FIRST TAMIYA MINI 4WD]]\n[[File:MINI-4WD-1986-WIKIPEDIA-HOT-SHOT.jpg|thumb|250px|1986 - FIRST TAMIYA MINI 4WD RACER]]\n[[File:MINI-4WD-1987-WIKIPEDIA-LUNCH-BOX.jpg|thumb|250px|1987 - TAMIYA MINI 4WD WILD VERSION]]\n[[File:Mini 4WD.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Rising Trigger'' from [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] and upgradeable components]]\n[[File:DASH-3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Racer Mini 4WD Dash-3 ''Shooting Star'' from [[Dash!

This particular type of Mini 4WD uses horizontal side rollers to guide the vehicle along the vertical walls of the un-banked track for steering, providing speeds from 14 to 65&nbsp;km/H<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbMiEltAxsc YouTube Video Info on Mini 4WD Speed]</ref> (9 to 40&nbsp;mph) on the track. At scale, (multiplied by 30), 1:1 speed represents 420 to 1,950 km/H or 270 to 1,200 mph. \n\n==History==\nIn 1980, the first, real mini 4WD series of vehicles, called Stomper 4x4 / [[Stompers (toy)]], were 1/32 scale and invented by Adolph Eddy Goldfarb<ref>[http://www.stomper4x4.com/bio.htm Autobiography of Mr. Goldfarb]</ref> and produced by [[Schaper Toys]] of Minnesota, USA. Later, from 1983 to 1986, a smaller version of Stomper was distributed in McDonald's Happy Meals.<ref>[http://collections.mnhs.org/cms/display.php?irn=10138492&return=brand%3Dcms%26count%3D25%26displaymode%3Dlist%26q%3Dstomper%26sort%3Ddesc Minnesota Historical Society]</ref> A multitude of replicas produced by other companies led to lengthy lawsuits, and eventually the company sold the product to Tyco, after which, sales declined.\n\nThe original [[Schaper Toys]] Stomper / [[Stompers (toy)]] vehicles of 1980 and subsequent Tamiya replicas of 1982 were heavily influenced by the worldwide craze for 4WD vehicles that started in 1979 with the inaugural running of the Paris [[Dakar Rally]] in 1979, which is evidenced by the particular make of those models. The first Shaper model vehicles produced in 1980 were the [[Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] pickup trucks. The first Tamiya replicas produced in 1982 were the [[Ford]] and [[Chevrolet]] pickup trucks.\n\nIn 1982, a [[Japan]]ese company, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]], produced their own replica versions of the 1/32 scale [[Schaper Toys]] Stomper / [[Stompers (toy)]] that utilized worm gears and spur gears.\n\nAlso, in 1982, Tamiya mini 4WD kits were sold by Model Rectifier Corp (MRC), the exclusive U.S. Distributor of Tamiya.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qCesmPpziF4C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=tamiya+model+rectifier+corp&source=bl&ots=-aJx1cF3Mh&sig=2mfoJ0mvMX7071C-_-umXpSzqgs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LKnIUqvXKc2JogTkh4KwDA&sqi=2&ved=0CGAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=tamiya%20model%20rectifier%20corp&f=false The Legal and Economic Aspects of Gray Market Goods By Seth E. Lipner]</ref> The kits were manufactured in Japan while the boxes were printed in Canada. The kit parts were then packaged into the boxes in Edison, New Jersey, USA. MRC continued to sell Mini 4WD kits until at least 1990, which may be the year their Tamiya license expired.\n\nIn 1986, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced their 4WD Mini Racer (\u30df\u30cb\u56db\u99c6) series as a powered variant of their plastic automobile model kits. Interestingly, these highly modifiable racing model kits are larger at 1/30 scale, although still marketed as 1/32 scale. Due to the nature of these model kits being highly modifiable, racing and tuning up Mini 4WD cars has become a [[hobby]] for people across the world.<ref>[http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=mini+4wd#q=mini%204wd&cmpt=q Current Google Trends for Mini 4WD]</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Tamiya commissioned [[Shogakukan]], a Japanese publishing company, to produce two [[anime]] television series based on the Mini 4WD cars: [[Dash! Yonkuro]] by [[Zaurus Tokuda]], [[Bakus\u014d Ky\u014ddai Let's & Go!!]], [[Bakus\u014d Ky\u014ddai Let's & Go!!|Bakusou Kyoudai Let's & Go WGP]] in 1996, [[Bakus\u014d Ky\u014ddai Let's & Go!!|Bakusou Kyoudai Let's & Go MAX]], and finally [[Bakus\u014d Ky\u014ddai Let's & Go!!

Yonkuro. This category of racing grew into a worldwide success by 2017 and continues to grow in recognition and participation.<ref>[http://streetmini4wdhome.altervista.org/history/ Street Mini 4WD]</ref> \n\nIn 1999, Tamiya Japan temporarily suspended the ''Great Japan Cup'' national championships for Mini 4WD racers.\n\nBy the 2000s, at least twenty-eight (28) other companies had ventured into the Mini 4WD market, and famously included [[Tokyo Marui]], [[Kyosho]], [[Academy Plastic Model|Academy]], Auldey Animation and Toys<ref>https://auldeytoys.nl/en/</ref>, [[Circuit no \u014ckami]], [[Aoshima Bunka Kyozai]], [[Matchbox (brand)]], [[Revell]], [[Hot Wheels]], [[Tonka]], [[Hasbro]], and [[Bandai]]. Most of them introduced their own lines of mini cars, while some, from China, produce counterfeit, sometimes low quality, replicas of Tamiya cars.<ref>[http://www.mini-4wd.de/mini4wd.html Historical Mini 4WD Box Art Gallery]</ref> These replicas are sold in the Philippines under brand names such as Jiada, Jiali, AA, Yu Xing, etc.\n\nIn 2001, due to the introduction of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|S.T.E.M.]], Mini 4WD has been used extensively for educational purposes in schools around the world, for teaching science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nBeginning again in 2006, [[Japan]] holds National Mini 4WD Championships in Spring, Summer and Autumn each year<ref>[http://tamiyamini4wd.com Mini 4WD History]</ref> and by 2012 Mini 4WD was popular in more countries including [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[India]] and [[China]].  After a brief lull, there was a sudden resurgence of the popularity of the hobby in the [[Philippines]] in the last half of 2018, where racing tournaments happened almost every weekend.\n\nThe World Endurance Championship was first run in 2012 as a replacement for the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup and has increased its influence on Mini 4WD ever since.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, Tamiya produced several kits based on [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] (WEC) cars, including LMP1, LMP2, GT1, GT2, GT3 and GT4 classes. The LMP1 and LMP2 models were based on the 2012 [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]], the 2014 [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]] and the 2016 [[Toyota TS050 Hybrid]].\n\nAccording to [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]], the world record for Longest Mini 4WD Track was created on\n3 November 2019 at 3,191.58 meters at Amagi Dome in Izu, Shizuoka, Japan.<ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-8000/longest-mini-4wd-race-track/ Guinness World Record for Mini 4WD]</ref>\n\n===Longest Mini 4WD Track World Records===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!

For example; Circuit Sprint Racing, Circuit Endurance Racing and Street Racing are categories. \n\nWithin the Circuit Sprint Racing category, there are many classes, such as Japan Cup, F-1 Series, Box Stock, Stock, Modified, Open, Technical, Speed-Technical, Semi-Speed Long Jump and Drag Racing. \n\nWithin the Circuit Endurance Racing category, there are many classes, such as LMP1, LMP2, LMGTE Pro, LMGTE AM, GT1, GT2, GT3, TCE and more. \n\nWithin the Street Racing category,  there are 2 classes, such as Normal and Wild. Within each class of racing there may be many types, where the types differ by minor modifications according to each host's own decision.\n\n===Circuit Sprint Racing===\n\nCircuit Sprint racing is where the cars usually run on a 2, 3 or 5-lane track made of plastic or wood. Due to the nature of the lane-changing mechanism and for the purpose of cycling through a multitude of participants, a 2-lane race lasts 2 laps, a 3-lane race lasts 3 laps and a 5-lane race lasts 5 laps. Typical sprint track circuit lengths are usually between 20 and 200 meters. At an average track speed of 20 kilometers per hour, a car is able to finish the entire race in 3.6 to 36 seconds, respectively.\n\n===Circuit Endurance Racing===\n\nCircuit Endurance racing is where the cars usually run on a 1, 2, 3 or 5-lane track made of plastic or wood. Due to the nature of endurance racing, the minimum length of time for an endurance race is one (1) hour. Typical endurance track circuit lengths are usually between 200 and 2,000 meters. At an average top track speed of 20 kilometers per hour, a car is able to complete 20,000 meters per hour. Thus, during a four (4) hour race, a car may complete 80,000 meters. The longest endurance race is 24-hours where a car may complete 480,000 meters in that time. That is equivalent to 480 kilometers or 298.3 miles.\n\n===Out of Track===\n\nOut of Track is a category where the Mini 4WD are driven using a special driving stick similar to the one used in hockey.\nIt's considered a sporting discipline, since the racer has to run in order to drive the Mini 4WD.\n\nThis category is directly inspired from \"Dash!Yonkuro\" racing style.\n\nIt includes the \"Regular\" competitions, mainly carried out in parks, RC 1:10 tracks, asphalt and cement bottoms and Off-road ones, mainly carried out on rough paths, like sand.\n\nThe two main communities organise events in this category are Mini 4WD Sport and Street Mini 4WD\n\n==Generations (1980)==\n\n'''Stomper 4x4s''' was the first official mini 4wd, created on February 14, 1980, by Adolph Eddy Goldfarb<ref>http://www.google.com/patents/US4306375 United States Patent Office for Stomper</ref> and sold by [[Schaper Toys]]. These toys were battery-powered vehicles that ran on a single [[AA battery]] and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that turned both axles. Of the first vehicles were a Ford Truck and a Chevrolet Truck.\n\n==Generations (1982)==\n\nIn 1982, Mini 4WD was produced by [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]]. These toys were battery-powered vehicles that ran on a pair of [[AA battery]] and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that turned both axles. Of the first vehicles were a Ford Truck and a Chevrolet Truck.\n\n==Generations (1986-1989)==\n* In 1986, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Racing Mini 4WD series starting with Hotshot Jr. and the Type-1 chassis. All Type-1 chassis kits were supplied with thick, big racing wheels and super slick spiked tires.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamiya.com/english/tamiya/tamiya_03.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929173915/http://www.tamiya.com/english/tamiya/tamiya_03.htm |archive-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Emperor and the Type-2 chassis were introduced. Like the Type-1 chassis kits, all Type-2 chassis kits also have spiked tires of the super slick type.\n* Vanquish Jr. and the Type-3 chassis with the standard large diameter tires and fin type wheels were introduced while the Type-2 Dash! Yonkuro cars were also re-released on the Type-3 with the same big racing wheels and smooth super slick tires.\n* In 1989, Crimson Glory was released with the FM chassis, this unique chassis had the motor placed on the front of the chassis which was believed to give the car an upslope and downhill balance.\n* In 1989, [[HASBRO]] released several versions of their [[Record Breakers: World of Speed]] series kits.<ref>[https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-11-21-8903110756-story.html Chicago Tribune]</ref> \n* And in 1990, the Manta Ray Jr. and the Zero chassis were produced.\n\n==Generations (1990-1999)==\n\n* In 1993, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Super Mini 4WD series starting with Liberty Emperor and the Super-1 chassis and it is the first series to only use the standard large diameter wheels and tires.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\"/>\n* In 1994, Strato Vector and the Super FM chassis were produced.\n* In 1994, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Fully Cowled Mini 4WD series starting with Magnum Saber on the Super-1 chassis and it is the first to have cars equipped with small diameter narrow wheels and tires.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\"/>\n* In 1995, Cyclone Magnum was released with the Super TZ chassis and wide thread wheels and tires.\n* In 1995, Black Stalker and the Super TZ chassis were produced.\n* In 1996, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced an Aero Mini 4WD series starting with Max Breaker and the Super X chassis. In the same year, a Mighty Mini 4WD series was produced starting with Dyna Hawk.<ref name=\"tamiya.com\"/>\n* Also in 1998, Lightning Magnum and the VS chassis were introduced.\n\n==Generations (2000-2009)==\n* In 2003, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced the R/C Mini 4WD series starting with Subaru Impreza WRC 2002 and the TR-1 chassis, a chassis that runs with a receiver unit and a single-button radio controller. As the cheapest alternative to actual R/C cars and [[slot car]]s, the receiver unit is removable to let the car freely run on the track with just the motor and batteries, there were also car component kits and unique tune-up parts produced. However, the R/C Mini 4WD cars' popularity were not widespread after its introduction and Tamiya continued making free-running Mini 4WDs.\n* In 2005, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced the Mini 4WD PRO series starting with Nitro Thunder and the MS chassis, a chassis run by a dual-axle motor and can be separated into three parts: a front N-unit, rear T-unit and the midship unit containing the motor and batteries.\n* In 2005, [[Bandai]] released Real Machines Series in collaboration with [[Toyota]].\n\n==Generations (2010-2019)==\n* In 2010, Tamiya produced the Super-II chassis as the successor to the Super-1 chassis with more compatibility with optional parts meant for other chassis and as such were originally sold as premium versions of their original counterparts. Later in 2011, Tamiya started producing new Mini 4WDs on this chassis starting with the Astute RS.\n* In 2012, [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] produced a Mini 4WD REV series starting with Aero Avante and the AR chassis, this new chassis has improved aerodynamics, easy motor and battery removal without removing the body part and a monocoque design.\n* In 2013, Tamiya created the MA chassis series of cars as a subseries to the PRO series starting with Blast Arrow. The MA chassis combines the aerodynamics and monocoque aesthetics of the AR chassis and the inner structure aspects of the MS chassis.\n* In 2017, Tamiya produced the FM-A chassis as a subseries to the REV series starting with Rowdy Bull. The successor to the Super FM chassis, it combines the aerodynamics and the monocoque aesthetics of the AR chassis with the front-mounted motor of the FM and Super-FM chassis.\n\n==Generations (2020-2029)==\n* In 2020, Tamiya created the VZ chassis as the successor to the VS chassis with a removable front bumper like the MS chassis and a rear roller stay that can mount four rollers. First release of this VZ chassis was with the 18094 Neo-VQS which is a modernized version of the Vanquish Jr.\n\n== Mechanical Display & Corporate-Sponsored Mini 4WD Models (Tamiya) ==\n* In the late 1990s when Let's & Go!! MAX was aired on television in Japan, Tamiya produced a series of display model kits known as the ''Mechanical'' Mini 4WD series (stylized as Mini 4WD Mechanical). The cars in this series are static replicas of the mechanized cars shown in the anime itself and thus they cannot freely move unlike the actual Mini 4WDs.\n* Certain software, anime production companies and some regions in Japan also collaborated with Tamiya to merchandise the main and/or secondary characters of their anime, software mascots or even tourism icons for limited edition Mini 4WD kits through licensing as these companies believed that Mini 4WD is cheaper for them to invest in bulk quantities compared to R/C cars which are four to six times the price per kit in bulk.\n\n==Mini 4WD Design==\nIn a standard 4WD design, the separate four wheels are allowed to rotate at different speeds through the use of differentials. This is important for cornering to eliminate binding. In a Mini 4WD, this is not a standard design and is only achieved through optional one-way wheel sets. Thus, the standard Mini 4WD utilizes a direct drive to all 4 wheels even around corners. Chassis' are designed to hold the motor and batteries in differing arrangements. There are sideways motors positioned in the rear. There are sideways motors positions in the front. There are in-line motors positioned in the middle. \nRear and Front position motor designs position batteries side by side in the front or rear of the motor placement. Middle position motor designs position the batteries straddling either side of the motor. Rear and front position motor designs utilize a propeller rod extending from the main motor gear box that drives both the front and rear axles. Middle position motor design powers both the front and back wheels through separate gear boxes eliminating the need for such a propeller rod.\n\nChassis are designed with front bumpers, optional side and rear bumpers designed to hold guide rollers that interact with the track's 58mm high walls.\n\nThe body is designed from hard plastic or soft, transparent [[Polycarbonate]], known by the trademarked names [[Lexan]], for special or limited editions, which attaches with a catch-type lock at the back of the car, distinguishes one model from another.\n\n===Motors===\nThere are three specifications that characterize all motors: [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], [[torque]], and power-consumption.<ref>[https://www.tamiyausa.com/mini4wd-techtips/ Mini 4WD Motor Specs]</ref> RPM is the speed the motor provides, and the torque its strength. A higher RPM means higher maximum speed, higher torque gives more acceleration and allows the car to better withstand the difficulties of climbing slopes or running through turns.\n\nThe motor is one of the important components a mini 4WD racer need to make the car move, There are two types of motors: single-shaft or double-shaft motors.\n\n===Gears===\nDifferent types of gears have different ratios of rotation of the motor and the wheel, and they include  (3.5:1), (3:7:1), (4:1), (4.2:1), (5:1), and \"Special\" (ratio varies but are usually 6.4:1). The higher the ratio, the better the acceleration rate and torque; the lower the ratio, the better the maximum speed.<ref>[https://www.tamiyausa.com/mini4wd-techtips/ Mini 4WD Gearing Specifications]</ref>\n\n===Tires and Wheels===\nIt is recommended that, among the different wheels available, the compatible ones must maintain the same size as those from the assembly packet. The smaller the diameter of the wheel, the more stable it is, as the car's center of gravity is lowered. Although one can easily assume that a larger wheel suits a faster car the best, this is not at all the case. Large wheels are for cars with high gear ratio (i.e. \"5:1\") and weak motor; small wheels are for cars with low gear ratio and strong motor.<ref name=\"pokedream\">[http://mini4wd.pokedream.com/advice/wheels_tires/index.shtml Mini 4WD Extreme Info On Wheels]</ref> Wider wheels allow for more stability but suffer from friction, and thus, the loss of speed; thinner wheels are intended for speed, but the car could be susceptible to flipping off the track.\n\nThere are four types of different wheels: normal plastic, one-way, aluminum, and lock-nut.<ref name=\"pokedream\"/> Normal plastic wheels are fine, but they are not adequate for really fast cars. They become loose after disconnecting them from the axle several times. Additionally, they create drag when the car going through turns as the axle locks the two wheels at same speed, since the outer wheel must cover more distance than the inner wheel (relatively to the turn of the course). One-way wheels allow either side to roll faster than the other when turning, and minimize the speed loss in turns. Aluminum wheels are very light, sturdy, and best for speed. Some aluminum wheels have preventive measures against loosening with the axle. However, lock-nut wheels are the best in preventing the cars from losing the wheels during a run.\n\nThere are four types of tires: rubber, sponge, reston, and semi-pneumatic.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011116231135/http://www.geocities.com/alotstore/tips.html Mini 4WD Hobby Info On Tires]</ref> Rubber tires come as standard with the Mini 4WD, and, although it has good grip, it is heavy and is susceptible to slipping on wet surfaces. The alternate solution to the rubber tire are the reston or sponge tires, which are very light, have good grip, and are better suited for rainy days. Yet, these get dirty easily, and they tend to exhaust the motor.\n\n===Bumpers===\nBumpers are usually found at the opposite ends of the mini 4WD. Upgrading the bumper becomes a necessity as the mini 4WD is modified to run faster than what the stock kit usually runs. The faster the car, the more the car needs down force to counter the decrease in stability. The stock chassis+bumper combination does have a tendency to bend, causing the rollers to run at angles and may make the mini 4WD fly off the course. Aluminum, fiberglass, or carbon fiber plates are usually installed as after-market upgrades to prevent this from occurring. Another possible upgrade are the screws that keep the rollers to the bumper. Only Tamiya offers aluminum plates as upgrades.\n\nMost after-market upgrade plates are usually wider than the stock bumper, and they facilitate the installation of \"side extension\" plates that make the front profile of the mini 4WD even wider.\n\n===Rollers===\nRoller is the wheel that rests on either end of the mini car's bumper and glides against the wall of the course. This allows the car to change direction and maintain stability. Conventional roller will do fine on a car with average speed, but, on a much faster car, aluminum or ball-bearing rollers must be purchased to acquire additional downforce and stability. These rollers do not tilt in angle as the conventional plastic rollers, and, therefore, have better chance in preventing the car from flinging off the course. Ball-bearing rollers have small metal balls around the internal ring, on which the roller spins, in order to minimize friction. Some rollers consist of two rollers on a pole -one at the base and other at the top-, so that they may offer the best stability. There are three types of roller arrangements. The first one is in which all rollers are same-sized, and this is for straight courses. The second arrangement, in which larger rollers are stationed in the front, is less stable when running through corners but minimizes speed losses; the third arrangement, in which smaller rollers are put in the front, is more stable when running through corners but the car is more susceptible to speed losses as it pushes into the wall.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011116231135/http://www.geocities.com/alotstore/tips.html Mini 4WD Hobby Info On Rollers]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bakus\u014d Ky\u014ddai Let's & Go!!]] Popular [[anime]]/[[manga]] based on Mini 4WD\n*[[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]]\n*[[Racer Mini Yonku: Japan Cup]] - [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] video game\n*[[Record Breakers: World of Speed]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mini 4WD}}\n*[http://mini4wdrace.com Mini 4WD Community in United States]\n*[http://sns.prtls.jp/mini4wd/home.html Mini 4WD Community in Japan]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111209183232/http://www.tamiyamanila.org/ Mini 4WD Community in Philippines]\n*[http://www.oprekmini4wd.com Mini 4WD Community In Indonesia]\n*[http://www.fantasyland.it/tamiya/gare-mini4wd/ Mini 4WD Community In Italy]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/groups/2572783219655045 Mini 4WD Community In France]\n*[http://www.tcfans.org Mini 4WD Community In China]\n*[http://www.empressspeedway.com/ Mini 4WD Community In Hong Kong]\n*[http://mini4wd.pokedream.com Older, Yet Good Reference Site]\n*[http://www.mini-4wd.de Largest Mini 4WD Boxart Gallery & Historical Photos]\n*[http://www.pimentoso.com/mini4wd-track-editor/ Mini4WD Online Track Editor]\n{{scale model}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mini 4wd}}\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n[[Category:Tamiya Corporation]]\n[[Category:1980s toys]]\n[[Category:1990s toys]]\n[[Category:2000s toys]]\n[[Category:2010s toys]]\n", "name_user": "Mini4WD", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOut of Track:this edit should be a happy medium between what the last person completely deleted and what they paved over with their own words.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_4WD"}
