He wrote 14 novels in the ''Oz'' series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 adaptation of the first ''Oz'' book]] would become a landmark of 20th-century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as [[television]], [[augmented reality]], [[laptop]] computers (''[[The Master Key (novel)|The Master Key]]''), [[Mobile phone|wireless telephones]] (''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (''[[Mary Louise in the Country]]''), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work]]'').\n\n==Childhood and early life==\nBaum was born in [[Chittenango, New York]], in 1856 into a devout [[Methodist]] family. He had [[German American|German]], [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], and [[England|English]] ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (n\u00e9e Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood.<ref>Rogers, p. 1.</ref><ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Oz: The Wizard of Oz, The Emerald City of Oz, Glinda of Oz|author1=Baum, L.F.|author2=Zipes, J.|author3=Denslow, W.W.|date=1998|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=9781440674358|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVlPdbOSB6AC|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref> \"Lyman\" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \"Frank\".<ref>Hearn, Introduction, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. xv n. 3.</ref>\n[[File:Cadet L.

He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of ''The Rose Lawn Home Journal''. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they would give to family and friends for free.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Evan|title=Finding Oz: How L.

He specialized in raising the [[Hamburg (chicken)|Hamburg chicken]]. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, ''The Poultry Record'', and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: ''The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs''.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003117854?ref=ol#page/n6/mode/2up</ref>\n\nBaum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the [[Fourth of July]] memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as [[Santa Claus]] for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.<ref>Rogers, pp. 49.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Theater===\nBaum embarked on his lifetime infatuation\u2014and wavering financial success\u2014with the theater.<ref>Rogers, pp. 8\u20139, 16\u201317 and ff.</ref> A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way.

This experience may have influenced his story \"The Suicide of Kiaros\", first published in the literary journal ''The White Elephant''. A fellow clerk one day was found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide.\n\nBaum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks.<ref>Rogers, p. 6.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Abrams|first=Dennis|title=L.

''[[The Maid of Arran]]'' proved a modest success, a [[melodrama]] with songs based on [[William Black (novelist)|William Black]]'s novel ''A Princess of Thule''. Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical [[musical play|musical]], as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character's aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and [[operettas]]<!---following clause deleted as it makes no sense: though he was not employed to do so--->.\n\nOn November 9, 1882, Baum married [[Maud Gage Baum|Maud Gage]], a daughter of [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a famous [[women's suffrage]] and [[first wave feminism|feminist]] activist. While Baum was touring with ''The Maid of Arran'', the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum's ironically titled parlor drama ''Matches'', destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum's scripts, including ''Matches'', as well as costumes.\n\n===The South Dakota years===\nIn July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen, Dakota Territory]] where he opened a store called \"Baum's Bazaar\". His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store,<ref>Rogers, pp. 23\u20135.</ref> so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper ''The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' where he wrote the column ''Our Landlady''.<ref>Rogers, pp. 25\u20137 and ff.</ref> Following the death of [[Sitting Bull]] at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum urged the wholesale extermination of all America's native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=JJ|title=L.

Beginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called ''The Show Window'',<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.vmsd.com/content/throwbackthursday|title=#ThrowbackThursday|work=Visual Merchandising and Store Design|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref> later known as the ''Merchants Record and Show Window'', which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising.

''Mother Goose'' was a moderate success and allowed Baum to quit his  sales job (which had had a negative impact on his health). In 1899, Baum partnered with illustrator [[William Wallace Denslow|W. W. Denslow]] to publish ''[[Father Goose, His Book]]'', a collection of nonsense poetry. The book was a success, becoming the best-selling children's book of the year.<ref>Rogers, pp. 54\u201369 and ff.</ref>\n\n[[File:goose.gif|thumb|upright|right| The Baum\u2013Parrish Mother Goose used to promote a breakfast cereal (part 1 of 12 as a free premium)]]\n\n====''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''====\n{{main|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}\nIn 1900, Baum and Denslow (with whom he shared the copyright) published ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''  to much critical acclaim and financial success.<ref>Rogers, pp. 73\u201394.</ref> The book was the best-selling children's book for two years after its initial publication. Baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the [[Land of Oz]].\n\n====''The Wizard of Oz: Fred R. Hamlin's Musical Extravaganza''====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--only first sentence has a citation-->\n[[File:Tin-Man-poster-Hamlin.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|1903 poster of Dave Montgomery as the Tin Man in Hamlin's musical stage version.]]\nTwo years after ''Wizard''{{'s}} publication, Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer [[Paul Tietjens]] and director Julian Mitchell to produce a [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|musical stage version]] of the book under Fred R. Hamlin.<ref>Rogers, pp. 105\u201310.</ref> Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' in 1901 and based closely upon the book, but it was rejected. This stage version opened in Chicago in 1902 (the first to use the shortened title \"The Wizard of Oz\"), then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use. The stage version starred Anna Laughlin as [[Dorothy Gale]], alongside David C. Montgomery and [[Fred Stone]] as the [[Tin Woodman]] and [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] respectively, which shot the pair to instant fame.\n\nThe stage version differed quite a bit from the book, and was aimed primarily at adults. Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and [[Pastoria]] (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Senator [[Mark Hanna]], Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]]. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.\n\nBeginning with the success of the stage version, most subsequent versions of the story, including newer editions of the novel, have been titled \"The Wizard of Oz\", rather than using the full, original title. In more recent years, restoring the full title has become increasingly common, particularly to distinguish the novel from the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film]].\n\nBaum wrote a new Oz book, ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', with a view to making it into a stage production, which was titled ''[[The Woggle-Bug (musical)|The Woggle-Bug]]'', but Montgomery and Stone balked at appearing when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', which eventually became ''[[The Tik-Tok Man Of Oz]]''. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well enough to convince producer [[Oliver Morosco]] to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz]]'', but this was ultimately realized as a [[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)|film]]''.\n\n==Later life and work==\nWith the success of ''Wizard'' on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and published ''[[Dot and Tot of Merryland]]'' in 1901.<ref>Rogers, pp. 95\u20136.</ref> The book was one of Baum's weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with [[John R. Neill]] on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill's art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published ''The Oz Toy Book: Cut-outs for the Kiddies'' without authorization.\n\nBaum reportedly designed the chandeliers in the Crown Room of the [[Hotel del Coronado]]; however, that attribution has yet to be corroborated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life of 'Oz' creator coming to big screen|publisher=San Diego Tribune|author=Bell, Diane|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/sdut-frank-baum-coronado-movie-oz-wizard-golden-warner-2014sep22-story.html|date=September 22, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref> Several times during the development of the Oz series, Baum declared that he had written his last Oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands, including ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'' and ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]''. However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with ''[[The Master Key (novel)|The Master Key]]'' appearing on ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'''s survey of readers' favorite books well into the 1920s.\n\nIn 1905, Baum declared plans for an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying Pedloe Island off the coast of California to turn it into an Oz park. However, there is no evidence that he purchased such an island, and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles Pedloe in that area.<ref name=\"thewizardofoz\">{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?rlz=1T4ADRA_enUS335US336&gs_upl=0l0l3l496619lllllllllll0&hl=en&nfpr=1&q=cache:yc5lLfQhVK8J:http://thewizardofoz.info/wiki/Miscellaneous_questions+Pedloe+Island,+California&ct=clnk |title=\"Miscellaneous Questions\" about L.

Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and [[Woggle-Bug|H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E.]]<ref>\"First Princess of Oz and Owner of Island.\" June 18, 1905, unidentified Chicago newspaper clipping in the L. Frank Baum file at the New York Public Library of the Performing Arts</ref>  Baum abandoned his Oz park project after the failure of ''[[The Woggle-Bug (musical)|The Woggle-Bug]]'', which was playing at the Garrick Theatre in 1905.\n[[File:L. Frank Baum and characters in The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays 1908.png|thumb|right|200px|Baum surrounded by the characters in ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'']]\n\nBecause of his lifelong love of theatre, he financed elaborate musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum's worst financial endeavors was his ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'' (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum as if he were giving a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] to Oz.<ref>Rogers, pp. 162\u20133; Hearn, ''Annotated Wizard'', pp. lxvi\u2013lxxi.</ref> However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''. This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum's newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud's name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children's books, such as the fairy tales of [[Andrew Lang]], whose portrait he kept in his study)\u2014all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much less than he could have.\n\n{{anchor|pseudonyms}}Baum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-Oz books. They include:\n* Edith Van Dyne (the ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces]]'' series)\n* Laura Bancroft (''[[The Twinkle Tales]]'', ''[[Policeman Bluejay]]'')\n* Floyd Akers (''The Boy Fortune Hunters'' series, continuing the ''Sam Steele'' series)\n* Suzanne Metcalf (''Annabel'')\n* Schuyler Staunton (''[[The Fate of a Crown]]'', ''[[Daughters of Destiny (novel)|Daughters of Destiny]]'')\n* John Estes Cooke (''Tamawaca Folks'')\n* Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald (the ''Sam Steele'' series)\n\nBaum also anonymously wrote ''[[The Last Egyptian]]: A Romance of the Nile''. He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman's [[gentlemen's club|men's social group]] [[The Uplifters (club)|The Uplifters]],<ref>Rogers, pp. 182\u20133.</ref> for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations. He also wrote the group's parodic [[by-laws]]. The group also included [[Will Rogers]], but was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent. Many of these play's titles are known, but only ''[[The Uplift of Lucifer]]'' is known to survive (it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s). Prior to that, his last produced play was ''The Tik-Tok Man of Oz'' (based on ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' and the basis for ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''), a modest success in Hollywood that producer [[Oliver Morosco]] decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway. Morosco, incidentally, quickly turned to film production, as did Baum.\n\nIn 1914, Baum started his own film production company [[The Oz Film Manufacturing Company]],<ref>Rogers, pp. 110, 177, 181, 202\u20135 and ff.</ref> which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters. He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter. The rest of the board consisted of [[Louis F. Gottschalk]], Harry Marston Haldeman, and Clarence R. Rundel. The films were directed by [[J. Farrell MacDonald]], with casts that included [[Violet MacMillan]], [[Vivian Reed (silent film actress)|Vivian Reed]], [[Mildred Harris]], [[Juanita Hansen]], [[Pierre Couderc]], Mai Welles, Louise Emmons, [[J. Charles Haydon]], and early appearances by [[Harold Lloyd]] and [[Hal Roach]]. Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films (Rosson's younger brother [[Harold Rosson]] was the [[cinematographer]] on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', released in 1939). After little success probing the unrealized children's film market, Baum acknowledged his authorship of ''The Last Egyptian'' and made a film of it (portions of which are included in ''[[Decasia]]''), but the Oz name had become box office poison for the time being, and even a name change to [[Dramatic Feature Films]] and transfer of ownership to [[Frank Joslyn Baum]] did not help. Baum invested none of his own money in the venture, unlike ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'', but the stress probably took its toll on his health.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:L. Frank Baum grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.JPG|thumb|Baum's grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California. December 2011.]]\n\nOn May 5, 1919, Baum suffered a [[stroke]]. The following day he slipped into a coma but briefly awoke and spoke his last words to his wife, \"Now we can cross the [[Deadly Desert|Shifting Sands]].\" Frank died on May 6, 1919.<ref>Abrams p.99</ref>  He was buried in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>Rogers, p. 239.</ref>\n\nHis final Oz book, ''[[Glinda of Oz]]'', was published on July 10, 1920, a year after his death. The Oz series was continued long after his death by other authors, notably [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], who wrote an additional twenty-one Oz books.<ref name=\"RuthPlumlyThompson\">{{cite web|url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Thompson__Ruth_Plumly.html |title=Ruth Plumly Thompson |work=psu.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501121254/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Thompson__Ruth_Plumly.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Baum's beliefs==\n===Literary===\nBaum's avowed intentions with the Oz books and his other [[fairy tale]]s was to retell tales such as those which are found in the works of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] or [[Jinn|genies]], and remove the association of [[violence]] and moral teachings.<ref>Sale, p. 223.</ref> His first Oz books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased as the series progressed; in ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] objects to the use of violence, even to the use of violence against the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion.<ref>Riley, p. 164.</ref> His introduction is often cited as the beginning of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.\n\nAnother traditional element that Baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on [[Romance (love)|romance]]. He considered romantic love to be uninteresting to young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', the only element of romance lay in the background of the [[Tin Woodman]] and his love for [[Nimmie Amee]], which explains his condition and it does not otherwise affect the tale, and that of [[Gayelette]] and the enchantment of the [[Winged monkeys]]. The only other stories with such elements were ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'' and ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'', both based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.<ref>Hearn, pp. 138\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Political===\n====Women's suffrage advocate====\nSally Roesch Wagner of The [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] Foundation has published a pamphlet titled ''The Wonderful Mother of Oz'' describing how Matilda Gage's [[feminist]] politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Much of the politics in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ''Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for [[women's suffrage]]. Baum was the secretary of [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen]]'s Woman's Suffrage Club. [[Susan B. Anthony]] visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women's enfranchisement.\n\nSome of Baum's contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of his second Oz story ''The Marvelous Land of Oz''. In this story, General [[Jinjur]] leads the girls and women of Oz in a revolt, armed with knitting needles; they succeed and make the men do the household chores. Jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler, but [[Princess Ozma|a female]] advocating [[gender equality]] is ultimately placed on the throne. His Edith Van Dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities, including the ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces]]'', ''[[The Flying Girl]]'' and its sequel, and his girl sleuth Josie O'Gorman from [[The Bluebird Books]].\n\n====Views of Native Americans====\nDuring the period surrounding the 1890 [[Ghost Dance]] movement and  [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], Baum wrote two editorials about Native Americans for the ''Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' which have provoked controversy in recent times because of his assertion that the safety of white settlers depended on the wholesale [[genocide]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Sociologist Robert Venables has argued that Baum was not using sarcasm in the editorials.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venables|first=Robert|title=Twisted Footnote to Wounded Knee|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/TwistedFootnote.html|publisher=Northeast Indian Quarterly}}</ref>\n\nThe first piece was published on December 20, 1890, five days after the killing of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] [[Medicine man|holy man]], [[Sitting Bull]] (who was being held in custody at the time). Following is the complete text of the editorial:\n\n{{quote\n|Sitting Bull, most renowned Sioux of modern history, is dead.\n\nHe was not a Chief, but without Kingly lineage he arose from a lowly position to the greatest Medicine Man of his time, by virtue of his shrewdness and daring.\n\nHe was an Indian with a white man's spirit of hatred and revenge for those who had wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe gradually driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of subjection, should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.\n\nThe proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the [[Redskin]] is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are. History would forget these latter despicable beings, and speak, in latter ages of the glory of these grand Kings of forest and plain that [[James Fenimore Cooper|Cooper]] loved to heroize.\n\nWe cannot honestly regret their extermination, but we at least do justice to the manly characteristics possessed, according to their lights and education, by the early Redskins of America.<ref name=\"editorials\">{{cite web|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm |title=\"L.

Waller Hastings</ref><ref>Rogers, p. 259.</ref>}}\n\nBaum wrote a second editorial following the December 29, 1890 massacre and published on January 3, 1891:\n\n{{quote|The peculiar policy of the government in employing so weak and vacillating a person as [[Nelson A. Miles|General Miles]] to look after the uneasy Indians, has resulted in a terrible loss of blood to our soldiers, and a battle which, at best, is a disgrace to the war department. There has been plenty of time for prompt and decisive measures, the employment of which would have prevented this disaster.\n\nThe ''Pioneer'' has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination {{sic}} of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands. Otherwise, we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past.\n\nAn eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that \"when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.\"<ref name=\"editorials\" /><ref>Professor Robert Venables, Senior Lecturer Rural Sociology Department, Cornell University, \"Looking Back at Wounded Knee 1890\", ''Northeast Indian Quarterly'', Spring 1990</ref>}}\n\nThese two short editorials continue to haunt his legacy. In 2006, two descendants of Baum apologized to the Sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had caused.<ref name=apology>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Ray |title='Oz' Family Apologizes for Racist Editorials |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5662524 |work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe short story \"The Enchanted Buffalo\" claims to be a legend of a tribe of bison, and states that a key element made it into legends of Native American tribes.<!---preceding sentence makes no sense.---> Baum mentions his characters' distaste for a [[Hopi]] [[snake dance]] in ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John]]'', but also deplores the horrible situation of [[Indian Reservation]]s.

Gage was initiated into the Wolf Clan and admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons for her outspoken respect and sympathy for Native American people; it would seem unlikely that Baum could have harbored animosity for them in his mature years.<ref>Reneau, Reneau H. \"A Newer Testament: Misanthropology Unleashed,\" donlazaro translations, 2008, pp. 129-147</ref>\n\n====Political imagery in ''The Wizard of Oz''====\n{{Main|Political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}\n\nNumerous political references to the \"Wizard\" appeared early in the 20th century. Henry Littlefield, an upstate New York high school history teacher, wrote a scholarly article which was the first full-fledged interpretation of the novel as an extended political allegory of the politics and characters of the 1890s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphigory.com/oz.htm |title=The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism.first=Henry |last=LittlefieldHenry |work=American Quarterly. v. 16, 3, Spring 1964, 47\u201358 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819173851/http://www.amphigory.com/oz.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2010 }}</ref> Special attention was paid to the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] metaphors and debates over silver and gold.<ref>Attebery, pp. 86\u20137.</ref>  Baum was a Republican and avid supporter of Women's Suffrage, and it is thought that he did not support the political ideals of either the Populist movement of 1890\u20131892 or the [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryanite]]-silver crusade of 1896\u20131900. He published a poem in support of [[William McKinley]].<sup><ref>[http://www.halcyon.com/piglet/Populism.htm Oz Populism Theory<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.halcyon.com</ref></sup>\n\nSince 1964, many scholars, economists, and historians have expanded on Littlefield's interpretation, pointing to multiple similarities between the characters (especially as depicted in Denslow's illustrations) and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period. Littlefield himself wrote to ''The New York Times'' letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact, but that his original point was \"not to label Baum, or to lessen any of his magic, but rather, as a history teacher at Mount Vernon High School, to invest turn-of-the-century America with the imagery and wonder I have always found in his stories.\"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=December 20, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D9143CF934A35751C0A964958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/M/Motion%20Pictures|title='Oz' Author Kept Intentions to Himself|date=February 7, 1992|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref>\n\nBaum's newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s, and Denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children's books. A series of political references is included in the 1902 stage version, such as references by name to the President, to a powerful senator, and to John D. Rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the Tin Woodman. Scholars have found few political references in Baum's Oz books after 1902.\n\nBaum himself was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings, but he always replied that they were written to \"please children\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Tuerk|first=Richard|title=Oz in Perspective: Magic and Myth in the L.

He wrote 14 novels in the ''Oz'' series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 adaptation of the first ''Oz'' book]] would become a landmark of 20th-century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as [[television]], [[augmented reality]], [[laptop]] computers (''[[The Master Key (novel)|The Master Key]]''), [[Mobile phone|wireless telephones]] (''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (''[[Mary Louise in the Country]]''), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work]]'').\n\n==Childhood and early life==\nBaum was born in [[Chittenango, New York]] in 1856 into a devout [[Methodist]] family. He had [[German American|German]], [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[England|English]] ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (n\u00e9e Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood.<ref>Rogers, p. 1.</ref><ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Oz: The Wizard of Oz, The Emerald City of Oz, Glinda of Oz|author1=Baum, L.F.|author2=Zipes, J.|author3=Denslow, W.W.|date=1998|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=9781440674358|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVlPdbOSB6AC|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref> \"Lyman\" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \"Frank\".<ref>Hearn, Introduction, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. xv n. 3.</ref>\n[[File:Cadet L. Frank Baum 1868.jpg|thumb|left|Young Baum in the [[Peekskill Military Academy]]]]\nHis father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise.<ref>Rogers, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> Rose Lawn was located in [[Mattydale, New York]].<ref>[http://www.freethought-trail.org/site.php?By=SiteType&Page=2&Site=64 The house burned down in 1958 and became the site of a skating rink, itself later abandoned.

From the age of 12, he spent two miserable years at [[Peekskill Military Academy]] but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly [[Psychogenic pain|psychogenic]] [[heart attack]] and was allowed to return home.<ref>Rogers, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nBaum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap [[printing press]]. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of ''The Rose Lawn Home Journal''. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they would give to family and friends for free.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Evan|title=Finding Oz: How L. Frank Baum Discovered the Great American Story|date=2009|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547055107|page=16}}</ref> By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called ''The Stamp Collector'', printed an 11-page pamphlet called ''Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory'', and started a [[stamp dealer]]ship with  friends.<ref>Rogers, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nAt 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding fancy poultry. He specialized in raising the [[Hamburg (chicken)|Hamburg]]. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, ''The Poultry Record'', and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: ''The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs''.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/cu31924003117854?ref=ol#page/n6/mode/2up</ref>\n\nBaum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the [[Fourth of July]] memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as [[Santa Claus]] for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.<ref>Rogers, pp. 49.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Theater===\nBaum embarked on his lifetime infatuation\u2014and wavering financial success\u2014with the theater.<ref>Rogers, pp. 8\u20139, 16\u201317 and ff.</ref> A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way. Disillusioned, Baum left the theater \u2014 temporarily \u2014  and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law's dry goods company in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. This experience may have influenced his story \"The Suicide of Kiaros\", first published in the literary journal ''The White Elephant''. A fellow clerk one day was found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide.\n\nBaum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks.<ref>Rogers, p. 6.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Abrams|first=Dennis|title=L. Frank Baum|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=1-604-13501-8|page=122}}</ref> In 1880, his father built him a theater in [[Richburg, New York]], and Baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them. ''[[The Maid of Arran]]'' proved a modest success, a [[melodrama]] with songs based on [[William Black (novelist)|William Black]]'s novel ''A Princess of Thule''. Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical [[musical play|musical]], as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character's aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and [[operettas]]<!---following clause deleted as it makes no sense: though he was not employed to do so--->.\n\nOn November 9, 1882, Baum married [[Maud Gage Baum|Maud Gage]], a daughter of [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a famous [[women's suffrage]] and [[first wave feminism|feminist]] activist. While Baum was touring with ''The Maid of Arran'', the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum's ironically titled parlor drama ''Matches'', destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum's scripts, including ''Matches'', as well as costumes.\n\n===The South Dakota years===\nIn July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen, Dakota Territory]] where he opened a store called \"Baum's Bazaar\". His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store,<ref>Rogers, pp. 23\u20135.</ref> so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper ''The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' where he wrote the column ''Our Landlady''.<ref>Rogers, pp. 25\u20137 and ff.</ref> Following the death of [[Sitting Bull]] at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum urged the wholesale extermination of all America's native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=JJ|title=L.

Beginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called ''The Show Window'',<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.vmsd.com/content/throwbackthursday|title=#ThrowbackThursday|work=Visual Merchandising and Store Design|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref> later known as the ''Merchants Record and Show Window'', which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising. The major department stores of the time created elaborate Christmastime fantasies, using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move. The former ''Show Window'' magazine is still currently in operation, now known as ''VMSD'' magazine<ref name=\":0\" /> (visual merchandising + store design), based in Cincinnati.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vmsd.com|title={{!}} Visual Merchandising and Store Design|work=Visual Merchandising and Store Design|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref> In 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in drawing customers.<ref name=Smithsonian>Emily and Per Ola d'Aulaire, \"Mannequins: our fantasy figures of high fashion,\" ''Smithsonian'', Vol. 22, no. 1, April 1991</ref> He also had to work as a [[Vendor (supply chain)|traveling salesman]].<ref>Rogers, pp. 45\u201359.</ref>\n[[File:W._W._Denslow_1900.png|right|thumb|upright|alt=Black and white photo of man seated, drawing at a desk|Denslow in 1900]]\nIn 1897, he wrote and published ''[[Mother Goose in Prose]]'', a collection of [[Mother Goose]] rhymes written as prose stories and illustrated by [[Maxfield Parrish]]. ''Mother Goose'' was a moderate success and allowed Baum to quit his  sales job (which had had a negative impact on his health). In 1899, Baum partnered with illustrator [[William Wallace Denslow|W. W. Denslow]] to publish ''[[Father Goose, His Book]]'', a collection of nonsense poetry. The book was a success, becoming the best-selling children's book of the year.<ref>Rogers, pp. 54\u201369 and ff.</ref>\n\n[[File:goose.gif|thumb|upright|right| The Baum\u2013Parrish Mother Goose used to promote a breakfast cereal (part 1 of 12 as a free premium)]]\n\n====''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''====\n{{main|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}\nIn 1900, Baum and Denslow (with whom he shared the copyright) published ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''  to much critical acclaim and financial success.<ref>Rogers, pp. 73\u201394.</ref> The book was the best-selling children's book for two years after its initial publication. Baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the [[Land of Oz]].\n\n====''The Wizard of Oz: Fred R. Hamlin's Musical Extravaganza''====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--only first sentence has a citation-->\n[[File:Tin-Man-poster-Hamlin.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|1903 poster of Dave Montgomery as the Tin Man in Hamlin's musical stage version.]]\nTwo years after ''Wizard''{{'s}} publication, Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer [[Paul Tietjens]] and director Julian Mitchell to produce a [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|musical stage version]] of the book under Fred R. Hamlin.<ref>Rogers, pp. 105\u201310.</ref> Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' in 1901 and based closely upon the book, but it was rejected. This stage version opened in Chicago in 1902 (the first to use the shortened title \"The Wizard of Oz\"), then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use. The stage version starred Anna Laughlin as [[Dorothy Gale]], alongside David C. Montgomery and [[Fred Stone]] as the [[Tin Woodman]] and [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] respectively, which shot the pair to instant fame.\n\nThe stage version differed quite a bit from the book, and was aimed primarily at adults. Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and [[Pastoria]] (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Senator [[Mark Hanna]], Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]]. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.\n\nBeginning with the success of the stage version, most subsequent versions of the story, including newer editions of the novel, have been titled \"The Wizard of Oz\", rather than using the full, original title. In more recent years, restoring the full title has become increasingly common, particularly to distinguish the novel from the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film]].\n\nBaum wrote a new Oz book, ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', with a view to making it into a stage production, which was titled ''[[The Woggle-Bug (musical)|The Woggle-Bug]]'', but Montgomery and Stone balked at appearing when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', which eventually became ''[[The Tik-Tok Man Of Oz]]''. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well enough to convince producer [[Oliver Morosco]] to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz]]'', but this was ultimately realized as a [[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)|film]]''.\n\n==Later life and work==\nWith the success of ''Wizard'' on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and published ''[[Dot and Tot of Merryland]]'' in 1901.<ref>Rogers, pp. 95\u20136.</ref> The book was one of Baum's weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with [[John R. Neill]] on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill's art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published ''The Oz Toy Book: Cut-outs for the Kiddies'' without authorization.\n\nBaum reportedly designed the chandeliers in the Crown Room of the [[Hotel del Coronado]]; however, that attribution has yet to be corroborated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life of 'Oz' creator coming to big screen|publisher=San Diego Tribune|author=Bell, Diane|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/sdut-frank-baum-coronado-movie-oz-wizard-golden-warner-2014sep22-story.html|date=September 22, 2014|accessdate=March 30, 2019}}</ref> Several times during the development of the Oz series, Baum declared that he had written his last Oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands, including ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'' and ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]''. However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with ''[[The Master Key (novel)|The Master Key]]'' appearing on ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'''s survey of readers' favorite books well into the 1920s.\n\nIn 1905, Baum declared plans for an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying Pedloe Island off the coast of California to turn it into an Oz park. However, there is no evidence that he purchased such an island, and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles Pedloe in that area.<ref name=\"thewizardofoz\">{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?rlz=1T4ADRA_enUS335US336&gs_upl=0l0l3l496619lllllllllll0&hl=en&nfpr=1&q=cache:yc5lLfQhVK8J:http://thewizardofoz.info/wiki/Miscellaneous_questions+Pedloe+Island,+California&ct=clnk |title=\"Miscellaneous Questions\" about L.

Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and [[Woggle-Bug|H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E.]]<ref>\"First Princess of Oz and Owner of Island.\" June 18, 1905, unidentified Chicago newspaper clipping in the L. Frank Baum file at the New York Public Library of the Performing Arts</ref>  Baum abandoned his Oz park project after the failure of ''[[The Woggle-Bug (musical)|The Woggle-Bug]]'', which was playing at the Garrick Theatre in 1905.\n[[File:L. Frank Baum and characters in The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays 1908.png|thumb|right|200px|Baum surrounded by the characters in ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'']]\n\nBecause of his lifelong love of theatre, he financed elaborate musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum's worst financial endeavors was his ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'' (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum as if he were giving a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] to Oz.<ref>Rogers, pp. 162\u20133; Hearn, ''Annotated Wizard'', pp. lxvi\u2013lxxi.</ref> However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''. This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum's newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud's name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children's books, such as the fairy tales of [[Andrew Lang]], whose portrait he kept in his study)\u2014all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much less than he could have.\n\n{{anchor|pseudonyms}}Baum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-Oz books. They include:\n* Edith Van Dyne (the ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces]]'' series)\n* Laura Bancroft (''[[The Twinkle Tales]]'', ''[[Policeman Bluejay]]'')\n* Floyd Akers (''The Boy Fortune Hunters'' series, continuing the ''Sam Steele'' series)\n* Suzanne Metcalf (''Annabel'')\n* Schuyler Staunton (''[[The Fate of a Crown]]'', ''[[Daughters of Destiny (novel)|Daughters of Destiny]]'')\n* John Estes Cooke (''Tamawaca Folks'')\n* Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald (the ''Sam Steele'' series)\n\nBaum also anonymously wrote ''[[The Last Egyptian]]: A Romance of the Nile''. He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman's [[gentlemen's club|men's social group]] [[The Uplifters (club)|The Uplifters]],<ref>Rogers, pp. 182\u20133.</ref> for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations. He also wrote the group's parodic [[by-laws]]. The group also included [[Will Rogers]], but was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent. Many of these play's titles are known, but only ''[[The Uplift of Lucifer]]'' is known to survive (it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s). Prior to that, his last produced play was ''The Tik-Tok Man of Oz'' (based on ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' and the basis for ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''), a modest success in Hollywood that producer [[Oliver Morosco]] decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway. Morosco, incidentally, quickly turned to film production, as did Baum.\n\nIn 1914, Baum started his own film production company [[The Oz Film Manufacturing Company]],<ref>Rogers, pp. 110, 177, 181, 202\u20135 and ff.</ref> which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters. He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter. The rest of the board consisted of [[Louis F. Gottschalk]], Harry Marston Haldeman, and Clarence R. Rundel. The films were directed by [[J. Farrell MacDonald]], with casts that included [[Violet MacMillan]], [[Vivian Reed (silent film actress)|Vivian Reed]], [[Mildred Harris]], [[Juanita Hansen]], [[Pierre Couderc]], Mai Welles, Louise Emmons, [[J. Charles Haydon]], and early appearances by [[Harold Lloyd]] and [[Hal Roach]]. Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films (Rosson's younger brother [[Harold Rosson]] was the [[cinematographer]] on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', released in 1939). After little success probing the unrealized children's film market, Baum acknowledged his authorship of ''The Last Egyptian'' and made a film of it (portions of which are included in ''[[Decasia]]''), but the Oz name had become box office poison for the time being, and even a name change to [[Dramatic Feature Films]] and transfer of ownership to [[Frank Joslyn Baum]] did not help. Baum invested none of his own money in the venture, unlike ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'', but the stress probably took its toll on his health.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:L. Frank Baum grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.JPG|thumb|Baum's grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California. December 2011.]]\n\nOn May 5, 1919, Baum suffered a [[stroke]]. The following day he slipped into a coma but briefly awoke and spoke his last words to his wife, \"Now we can cross the [[Deadly Desert|Shifting Sands]].\" Frank died on May 6, 1919.<ref>Abrams p.99</ref>  He was buried in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>Rogers, p. 239.</ref>\n\nHis final Oz book, ''[[Glinda of Oz]]'', was published on July 10, 1920, a year after his death. The Oz series was continued long after his death by other authors, notably [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], who wrote an additional twenty-one Oz books.<ref name=\"RuthPlumlyThompson\">{{cite web|url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Thompson__Ruth_Plumly.html |title=Ruth Plumly Thompson |work=psu.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501121254/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Thompson__Ruth_Plumly.html |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Baum's beliefs==\n===Literary===\nBaum's avowed intentions with the Oz books and his other [[fairy tale]]s was to retell tales such as those which are found in the works of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] or [[Jinn|genies]], and remove the association of [[violence]] and moral teachings.<ref>Sale, p. 223.</ref> His first Oz books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased as the series progressed; in ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] objects to the use of violence, even to the use of violence against the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion.<ref>Riley, p. 164.</ref> His introduction is often cited as the beginning of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.\n\nAnother traditional element that Baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on [[Romance (love)|romance]]. He considered romantic love to be uninteresting to young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', the only element of romance lay in the background of the [[Tin Woodman]] and his love for [[Nimmie Amee]], which explains his condition and it does not otherwise affect the tale, and that of [[Gayelette]] and the enchantment of the [[Winged monkeys]]. The only other stories with such elements were ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'' and ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'', both based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.<ref>Hearn, pp. 138\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Political===\n====Women's suffrage advocate====\nSally Roesch Wagner of The [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] Foundation has published a pamphlet titled ''The Wonderful Mother of Oz'' describing how Matilda Gage's [[feminist]] politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Much of the politics in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ''Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for [[women's suffrage]]. Baum was the secretary of [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen]]'s Woman's Suffrage Club. [[Susan B. Anthony]] visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women's enfranchisement.\n\nSome of Baum's contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of his second Oz story ''The Marvelous Land of Oz''. In this story, General [[Jinjur]] leads the girls and women of Oz in a revolt, armed with knitting needles; they succeed and make the men do the household chores. Jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler, but [[Princess Ozma|a female]] advocating [[gender equality]] is ultimately placed on the throne. His Edith Van Dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities, including the ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces]]'', ''[[The Flying Girl]]'' and its sequel, and his girl sleuth Josie O'Gorman from [[The Bluebird Books]].\n\n====Views of Native Americans====\nDuring the period surrounding the 1890 [[Ghost Dance]] movement and  [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], Baum wrote two editorials about Native Americans for the ''Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' which have provoked controversy in recent times because of his assertion that the safety of white settlers depended on the wholesale [[genocide]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Sociologist Robert Venables has argued that Baum was not using sarcasm in the editorials.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venables|first=Robert|title=Twisted Footnote to Wounded Knee|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/TwistedFootnote.html|publisher=Northeast Indian Quarterly}}</ref>\n\nThe first piece was published on December 20, 1890, five days after the killing of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] [[Medicine man|holy man]], [[Sitting Bull]] (who was being held in custody at the time). Following is the complete text of the editorial:\n\n{{quote\n|Sitting Bull, most renowned Sioux of modern history, is dead.\n\nHe was not a Chief, but without Kingly lineage he arose from a lowly position to the greatest Medicine Man of his time, by virtue of his shrewdness and daring.\n\nHe was an Indian with a white man's spirit of hatred and revenge for those who had wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe gradually driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of subjection, should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.\n\nThe proud spirit of the original owners of these vast prairies inherited through centuries of fierce and bloody wars for their possession, lingered last in the bosom of Sitting Bull. With his fall the nobility of the [[Redskin]] is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them. The Whites, by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians. Why not annihilation? Their glory has fled, their spirit broken, their manhood effaced; better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are. History would forget these latter despicable beings, and speak, in latter ages of the glory of these grand Kings of forest and plain that [[James Fenimore Cooper|Cooper]] loved to heroize.\n\nWe cannot honestly regret their extermination, but we at least do justice to the manly characteristics possessed, according to their lights and education, by the early Redskins of America.<ref name=\"editorials\">{{cite web|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm |title=\"L.

Waller Hastings</ref><ref>Rogers, p. 259.</ref>}}\n\nBaum wrote a second editorial following the December 29, 1890 massacre and published on January 3, 1891:\n\n{{quote|The peculiar policy of the government in employing so weak and vacillating a person as [[Nelson A. Miles|General Miles]] to look after the uneasy Indians, has resulted in a terrible loss of blood to our soldiers, and a battle which, at best, is a disgrace to the war department. There has been plenty of time for prompt and decisive measures, the employment of which would have prevented this disaster.\n\nThe ''Pioneer'' has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination {{sic}} of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands. Otherwise, we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past.\n\nAn eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that \"when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.\"<ref name=\"editorials\" /><ref>Professor Robert Venables, Senior Lecturer Rural Sociology Department, Cornell University, \"Looking Back at Wounded Knee 1890\", ''Northeast Indian Quarterly'', Spring 1990</ref>}}\n\nThese two short editorials continue to haunt his legacy. In 2006, two descendants of Baum apologized to the Sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had caused.<ref name=apology>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Ray |title='Oz' Family Apologizes for Racist Editorials |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5662524 |work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=September 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe short story \"The Enchanted Buffalo\" claims to be a legend of a tribe of bison, and states that a key element made it into legends of Native American tribes.<!---preceding sentence makes no sense.---> Baum mentions his characters' distaste for a [[Hopi]] [[snake dance]] in ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John]]'', but also deplores the horrible situation of [[Indian Reservation]]s.

Gage was initiated into the Wolf Clan and admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons for her outspoken respect and sympathy for Native American people; it would seem unlikely that Baum could have harbored animosity for them in his mature years.<ref>Reneau, Reneau H. \"A Newer Testament: Misanthropology Unleashed,\" donlazaro translations, 2008, pp. 129-147</ref>\n\n====Political imagery in ''The Wizard of Oz''====\n{{Main|Political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}\n\nNumerous political references to the \"Wizard\" appeared early in the 20th century. Henry Littlefield, an upstate New York high school history teacher, wrote a scholarly article which was the first full-fledged interpretation of the novel as an extended political allegory of the politics and characters of the 1890s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphigory.com/oz.htm |title=The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism.first=Henry |last=LittlefieldHenry |work=American Quarterly. v. 16, 3, Spring 1964, 47\u201358 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819173851/http://www.amphigory.com/oz.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2010 }}</ref> Special attention was paid to the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] metaphors and debates over silver and gold.<ref>Attebery, pp. 86\u20137.</ref>  Baum was a Republican and avid supporter of Women's Suffrage, and it is thought that he did not support the political ideals of either the Populist movement of 1890\u20131892 or the [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryanite]]-silver crusade of 1896\u20131900. He published a poem in support of [[William McKinley]].<sup><ref>[http://www.halcyon.com/piglet/Populism.htm Oz Populism Theory<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.halcyon.com</ref></sup>\n\nSince 1964, many scholars, economists, and historians have expanded on Littlefield's interpretation, pointing to multiple similarities between the characters (especially as depicted in Denslow's illustrations) and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period. Littlefield himself wrote to ''The New York Times'' letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact, but that his original point was \"not to label Baum, or to lessen any of his magic, but rather, as a history teacher at Mount Vernon High School, to invest turn-of-the-century America with the imagery and wonder I have always found in his stories.\"<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=December 20, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D9143CF934A35751C0A964958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/M/Motion%20Pictures|title='Oz' Author Kept Intentions to Himself|date=February 7, 1992|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref>\n\nBaum's newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s, and Denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children's books. A series of political references is included in the 1902 stage version, such as references by name to the President, to a powerful senator, and to John D. Rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the Tin Woodman. Scholars have found few political references in Baum's Oz books after 1902.\n\nBaum himself was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings, but he always replied that they were written to \"please children\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Tuerk|first=Richard|title=Oz in Perspective: Magic and Myth in the L.

Later, he and his wife were encouraged by [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] to become members of the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1892.<ref>Algeo, pp. 270\u20133; Rogers, pp. 50\u20131 and ff.</ref> Baum's beliefs are often reflected in his writing. The only mention of a church in his Oz books is the [[porcelain]] one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''.

However, this golden bird was destroyed due to several invasions. \n\nThe introduction follows up with a young Tanhaji Malusare learning sword fight under his father.  After winning a sword fight and a duel between his father, the plot thickens.\n\n[[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] has escaped from the house arrest of Mughals but had to hand over his precious forts to [[Aurangzeb]]. [[Kondhana]] ([[Sinhagad|Singhad]]) is included too. Aurangzeb thus appoints Udaybhan Singh Rathod, a Rajput, to be the [[Kiladar|Killedar]] or fort keeper of Kondhana with the intention of making Kondhana the capital of the South. Shivaji Maharaj prepares to take back Kondhana, Tanhaji Malusare, unaware of the situation comes to Rajgad to invite the Maharaj for his son's - Raiba's - wedding. He eventually finds out due to the treacherous intentions of fellow ministers in the Maharaj's council and decides that Kondhana is more important than his son's wedding.\n\nAfter thorough planning, Tanhaji Malusare decides to attack Udaybhan before he can reach Kondhana. The attempt fails and Udaybhan along with Naagin, a fictional long canon, reaches Kondhana. Thus begins Tanhaji's actual battle of reconnaissance of the Kondhana fort, its secret doors and the actual war. After taking 300 mavalas with him, he climbs the Kondhana fort with Suryaji Malusare (brother of Tanhaji Malusare) and Shelar Mama (uncle of Tanhaji Malusare) along with 400 mavalas waits at the Kalyan Darwaza. A group of Marathas opens the Kalyan Darwaza and the Marathas rush into the fort. Tanhaji and the mavalas enter through the Pune Darwaza by sheer bravery and battle begins with Udaybhan singlehandedly destroying the Marathas. After the battle and exhilarating background music, the duel between Udaybhan and Tanhaji starts. While Tanhaji cuts the fire to the Naagin canon in mid-air, Udaybhan cuts his fore-arm. After wrapping his turban around his fore-arm he pushes Udaybhan along with Naagin down the fort. Shivaji Maharaj rushes onto Kondhana and Tanhaji dies in his presence.\n\nThe film ends with Tanhaji's wife Savitribai welcoming him in bridal attire, as she had promised him that she would grant any of his wishes if he won Kondhana and his wish was for her to come to him dressed up as a bride.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Tanaji Malusare]]\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as [[Uday Bhan|Udaybhan Singh Rathore]] \n* [[Kajol]] as Savitribai Malusare \n* [[Sharad Kelkar]] as [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]\n* [[Luke Kenny]] as [[Aurangzeb]]\n* [[Vipul Gupta]] as Jagat Singh \n* Padmavati Rao as [[Jijabai|Rajmata Jijabai]] \n* [[Shashank Shende]] as Shelaar Mama\n* [[Devdatta Nage]] as Suryaji Malusare \n* [[Neha Sharma]] as Kamla Devi \n* [[Ajinkya Deo]] as Chandraji Pisal\n* Yuri Suri as [[Jai Singh I|Mirza Raje Jai Singh]]\n* Jagannath Nivangune as Kaloji Malusare \n* Trisha Patil as Parvatibai \"Parvati\" Malusare \n* Hardik Sangani as Gondya\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Beshak Khan\n* Prasanna Ketkar as Sarnaik\n* Kailash Waghmare as Chultiya\n* Harsh Sharma as Young Tanhaji\n* Ranav Sharma as Young Suryaji\n* Arush Nand as Raiba Malusare\n* Dhairyasheel Gholap as Shrubhau\n* Nilesh Lalwani as Tatya\n* Pramod More as Leader of Gondia\n* Bhagyashree Nhalve as Suryaji's wife\n* Devendra Gaikwad as Raiba's father-in-law\n* Rajesh Ahir as Raja Sangram Singh\n\n== Production ==\n[[Pre-production]] began on 20 July 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/ajay-devgn-reveals-first-look-of-taanaji-the-unsung-warrior/story-JLG1bg6gPEWhTGhRZ0PIuJ.html|title=Ajay Devgn reveals first look of Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior|date=2017-07-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced from 25 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TSeries/status/1044483007912992769/|title=TSeries on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Marketing and release ==\nEarlier marketed as ''Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior'', it was revealed on Twitter by [[Ajay Devgn]] that the film will be known as ''Tanhaji''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In December 2017, the release date of ''Tanhaji'' was revealed as 22 November 2019 but was postponed to December 2019 due to shooting problems.

However, this golden bird was destroyed due to several invasions. \n\nThe introduction follows up with a young Tanhaji Malusare learning sword fight under his father.  After winning a sword fight and a duel between his father, the plot thickens.\n\n[[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]] has escaped from the house arrest of Mughals but had to hand over his precious forts to [[Aurangzeb]]. [[Kondhana]] ([[Sinhagad|Singhad]]) is included too. Aurangzeb thus appoints Udaybhan Singh Rathod, a Rajput, to be the [[Kiladar|Killedar]] or fort keeper of Kondhana with the intention of making Kondhana the capital of the South. Shivaji Maharaj prepares to take back Kondhana, Tanhaji Malusare, unaware of the situation comes to Rajgad to invite the Maharaj for his son's - Raiba's - wedding. He eventually finds out due to the treacherous intentions of fellow ministers in the Maharaj's council and decides that Kondhana is more important than his son's wedding.\n\nAfter thorough planning, Tanhaji Malusare decides to attack Udaybhan before he can reach Kondhana. The attempt fails and Udaybhan along with Naagin, a fictional long canon, reaches Kondhana. Thus begins Tanhaji's actual battle of reconnaissance of the Kondhana fort, its secret doors and the actual war. After taking 300 mavalas with him, he climbs the Kondhana fort with Suryaji Malusare (brother of Tanhaji Malusare) and Shelar Mama (uncle of Tanhaji Malusare) along with 400 mavalas waits at the Kalyan Darwaza. A group of Marathas opens the Kalyan Darwaza and the Marathas rush into the fort. Tanhaji and the mavalas enter through the Pune Darwaza by sheer bravery and battle begins with Udaybhan singlehandedly destroying the Marathas. After the battle and exhilarating background music, the duel between Udaybhan and Tanhaji starts. While Tanhaji cuts the fire to the Naagin canon in mid-air, Udaybhan cuts his fore-arm. After wrapping his turban around his fore-arm he pushes Udaybhan along with Naagin down the fort. Shivaji Maharaj rushes onto Kondhana and Tanhaji dies in his presence.\n\nThe film ends with Tanhaji's wife Savitribai welcoming him in bridal attire, as she had promised him that she would grant any of his wishes if he won Kondhana and his wish was for her to come to him dressed up as a bride.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as [[Tanaji Malusare]]\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as [[Uday Bhan|Udaybhan Singh Rathore]] \n* [[Kajol]] as Savitribai Malusare \n* [[Sharad Kelkar]] as [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]\n* [[Luke Kenny]] as [[Aurangzeb]]\n* [[Vipul Gupta]] as Jagat Singh \n* Padmavati Rao as [[Jijabai|Rajmata Jijabai]] \n* [[Shashank Shende]] as Shelaar Mama\n* [[Devdatta Nage]] as Suryaji Malusare \n* [[Neha Sharma]] as Kamla Devi \n* [[Ajinkya Deo]] as Chandraji Pisal\n* Yuri Suri as [[Jai Singh I|Mirza Raje Jai Singh]]\n* Jagannath Nivangune as Kaloji Malusare \n* Trisha Patil as Parvatibai \"Parvati\" Malusare \n* Hardik Sangani as Gondya\n* [[Nissar Khan]] as Beshak Khan\n* Prasanna Ketkar as Sarnaik\n* Kailash Waghmare as Chultiya\n* Harsh Sharma as Young Tanhaji\n* Ranav Sharma as Young Suryaji\n* Arush Nand as Raiba Malusare\n* Dhairyasheel Gholap as Shrubhau\n* Nilesh Lalwani as Tatya\n* Pramod More as Leader of Gondia\n* Bhagyashree Nhalve as Suryaji's wife\n* Devendra Gaikwad as Raiba's father-in-law\n* Rajesh Ahir as Raja Sangram Singh\n\n== Production ==\n[[Pre-production]] began on 20 July 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/ajay-devgn-reveals-first-look-of-taanaji-the-unsung-warrior/story-JLG1bg6gPEWhTGhRZ0PIuJ.html|title=Ajay Devgn reveals first look of Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior|date=2017-07-20|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced from 25 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TSeries/status/1044483007912992769/|title=TSeries on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Marketing and release ==\nEarlier marketed as ''Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior'', it was revealed on Twitter by [[Ajay Devgn]] that the film will be known as ''Tanhaji''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In December 2017, the release date of ''Tanhaji'' was revealed as 22 November 2019 but was postponed to December 2019 due to shooting problems.

R. R. Tolkien]]. \nWithin the fictional context of [[Tolkien's legendarium]], the tengwar were invented by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[F\u00ebanor]], and used first to write the Elven tongues [[Quenya]] and [[Telerin]]. Later a great number of [[languages of Middle-earth]] were written using the tengwar, including [[Sindarin]]. Tolkien used tengwar to write [[English language|English]]: most of Tolkien's tengwar samples are actually in English.\n\n== Internal history and terminology ==\nAccording to ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'' (Appendix D to ''Quendi and Eldar''), F\u00ebanor, when he created his script, introduced a change in terminology. He called a letter, i.e. a written representation of a spoken phoneme (''tengw\u00eb''), a  ''tengwa''. Previously, any letter or symbol had been called a ''sarat'' (from ''*sar'' \"incise\"). The alphabet of R\u00famil of Tirion, on which F\u00ebanor supposedly based his own work, was known as [[Sarati]]. It later became known as \"Tengwar of R\u00famil\".\n\nThe plural of ''tengwa'' was ''tengwar'', and this is the name by which F\u00ebanor's system became known. Since, however, in commonly used modes, an individual ''tengwa'' was equivalent to a consonant, the term ''tengwar'' in popular use became equivalent to \"consonant sign\", and the vowel signs were known as ''\u00f3matehtar''. By loan-translation, the tengwar became known as ''t\u00eew'' (singular ''t\u00eaw'') in Sindarin, when they were introduced to [[Beleriand]]. The letters of the earlier alphabet native to Sindarin were called ''[[cirth]]'' (singular ''certh'', probably from ''*kirte'' \"cutting\", and thus semantically analogous to Quenya ''sarat''). This term was loaned into exilic Quenya as ''certa'', plural ''certar''.\n\n==External history==\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[sarati]], a script developed by Tolkien in the late 1910s and described in ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]] 13'', anticipates many features of the tengwar: vowel representation by [[diacritic]]s (which is found in many tengwar varieties); different tengwar shapes; and a few correspondences between sound features and letter shape features (though inconsistent).\n\nEven closer to the tengwar is the Valmaric script, described in ''Parma Eldalamberon 14'', which Tolkien used from about 1922 to 1925. It features many tengwar shapes, the inherent vowel {{IPA|[a]}} found in some tengwar varieties, and the tables in the samples V12 and V13 show an arrangement that is very similar to one of the primary tengwar in the classical Quenya \"mode\".\n\n[[Jim Allan (author)|Jim Allan]] (''An Introduction to Elvish'', {{ISBN|0-905220-10-2}}) compared the tengwar with the ''Universal Alphabet'' of [[Francis Lodwick]] of 1686, both on grounds of the correspondence between shape features and sound features, and of the actual letter shapes.\n\n===Tengwar===\n[[Image:One Ring inscription.svg|thumb|300px|The inscription on the [[One Ring]], written in the [[Black Speech]] of [[Mordor]] using tengwar]]\n\nThe tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s. ''The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription'', the first published Tengwar sample, dates to 1937 (''[[The Hobbit]]'', most editions with colour plates). The full explanation of the tengwar was published in Appendix E of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1955.\n\nThe ''Mellonath Daeron Index of Tengwar Specimina'' (DTS) lists most of the known samples of tengwar by Tolkien.\n\nThere are only a few known samples predating publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'' (many of them published posthumously):\n\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS1 DTS 1]&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription'', published 1937\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS13 DTS 13]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Middle Page from the Book of Mazarbul''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS14 DTS 14]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Last Page from the Book of Mazarbul, Last Line'', this and the above one originally prepared for inclusion in ''The Lord of the Rings''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS15 DTS 15]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Steinborg Drawing Title''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS22 DTS 22]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Ilbereth's Greeting'' from [[The Father Christmas Letters]], dating to 1937\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS24 DTS 24]&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Treebeard Page''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS50 DTS 50]/[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS51 51]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Edwin Lowdham's Manuscript'' from [[The Notion Club Papers]] has [[Old English language]] text written in tengwar (with a few [[Ad\u00fbnaic]] and Quenya words), dating to 1945/6.\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS10 DTS 10]&nbsp;\u2013 The Brogan Tengwa-greetings, appearing in ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', No. 118, tentatively dated to 1948.\n*The following samples presumably predate the Lord of the Rings, but they were not explicitly dated: [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS16 DTS 16], [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS17 DTS 17], [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS18 DTS 18]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Elvish Script Sample I, II, III'', with parts of the English poems ''Errantry'' and ''Bombadil'', first published in the ''Silmarillion Calendar 1978'', later in ''Pictures by J. R. R. Tolkien'', as well as [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS23 DTS 23]&nbsp;\u2013 ''So L\u00fathien'', a page of the English ''Lay of Leithian'' text facsimiled in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'':299.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Tengwar alphabet1.png|thumb|200px|The tengwar table, with the name of each ''tengwa''.]]\n\n=== Letters ===\nThe most notable characteristic of the tengwar script is that the shapes of the letters correspond to the [[distinctive feature]]s of the sounds they represent. The Quenya consonant system has five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]], and [[glottal consonant|glottal]]. The velars distinguish between plain and labialized (that is, articulated with rounded lips, or followed by a {{IPA|[w]}} sound). Each point of articulation, and the corresponding tengwa series, has a name in the classical Quenya mode. Dental sounds are called  ''Tincot\u00e9ma'' and are represented with the tengwar in column I. Labial sounds are called ''Parmat\u00e9ma'', and represented by the column II tengwar; velar sounds are called ''Calmat\u00e9ma'', represented by column III; and labialized velar sounds are called ''Quesset\u00e9ma'', represented by the ''tengwar'' of column IV. Palatal sounds are called ''Tyelpet\u00e9ma'' and have no tengwa series of their own, but are represented by column III letters with an added diacritic for following {{IPA|[j]}}.\n\nSimilarly shaped letters reflect not only similar places of articulation, but also similar manners of articulation. In the classical Quenya mode, row 1 represents voiceless stops, row 2 voiced prenasalized stops, row 3 voiceless fricatives, row 4 voiceless prenasalized stops, row 5 nasal stops, and row 6 approximants.<ref>The Complete Tolkien Companion, Third Edition.  Tyler, J.E.A.  New York: St. Martins, 2004.</ref>\n\n====Regularly formed letters====\nMost letters are constructed by a combination of two basic shapes: a vertical '''stem''' (either long or short) and either one or two rounded '''bows''' (which may or may not be underscored, and may be on the left or right of the stem).\n\nThese principal letters are divided into four series (\"t\u00e9mar\") that correspond to the main places of articulation and into six grades (\"tyeller\") that correspond to the main [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]. Both vary among modes.\n\nEach series is headed by the basic signs composed of a vertical stem descending below the line, and a single bow. These basic signs represent the [[phonation|voice]]less [[stop consonant]]s for that series. For the classical Quenya mode, they are {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}, and the series are named ''tincot\u00e9ma'', ''parmat\u00e9ma'', ''calmat\u00e9ma'', and ''quesset\u00e9ma'', respectively; t\u00e9ma means \"series\" in Quenya.\n\nIn rows of the ''general use'', there are the following correspondences between letter shapes and manners of articulation:\n* Doubling the bow turns the [[phonation|voiceless consonant]] into a voiced one.\n* Raising the stem above the line turns it into the corresponding [[fricative consonant|fricative]].\n* Shortening it (so it is only the height of the bow) creates the corresponding [[nasal consonant|nasal]]. In most modes, the signs with shortened stem and single bow do not correspond to the [[phonation|voiceless]] nasals, but to the [[approximant]]s.\n\nIn addition to these variations of the tengwar shapes, there is yet another variation, the use of stems that are extended both above and below the line. This shape may correspond to other consonant variations required. Except for some English abbreviations, it is not used in any of the better known tengwar modes, but it occurs in a [[Qenya]] <!--sic--> mode where the tengwa Parma with extended stem is used for {{IPA|/pt/}} and the tengwa Calma with extended stem is used for {{IPA|/kt/}}.<ref>See [[Parma Eldalamberon]] 19 (2010), pp. 41\u201343.</ref> The tengwar with raised stems sometimes occur in [[glyph]] variants that look like extended stems, as seen in the inscription of the [[One Ring]].\n\nHere is an example from the ''parmat\u00e9ma'' (the signs with a closed bow on the right side) in the \"general use\" of the tengwar:\n[[Image:Parmat\u00e9ma.png|right|60px]]\n* The basic sign, named ''parma'', (with descending stem) represents {{IPA|/p/}} (it happens to look much like the Latin letter ''P'').\n* With the bow doubled, ''umbar'', it represents {{IPA|/b/}}.\n* With a raised stem, ''formen'', it represents {{IPA|/f/}}.\n* With a raised stem and a doubled bow, ''ampa'', it represents generally {{IPA|/v/}} but possibly {{IPA|/mp/}} (depending upon the language).\n* With a short stem and double bow, ''{{not a typo|malta}}'', it represents {{IPA|/m/}}.\n* With short stem and single bow, ''vala'', it represents {{IPA|/w/}}, or {{IPA|/v/}} if that has the phonological behaviour of a sonorant (as e.g. in Quenya).\n\nIn some languages such as Quenya, which do not contain any voiced fricatives other than \"v\", the raised stem + doubled bow row is used for the very common nasal+stop sequences (''nt'', ''mp'', ''nk'', ''nqu''). In such cases, the \"w\" sign in the previous paragraph is used for \"v\". In the mode of Beleriand, found on the door to [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], the bottom ''tyell\u00eb'' is used for nasals (e.g., ''vala'' is used for {{IPA|/m/}}) and the fifth ''tyell\u00eb'' for doubled nasals (''{{not a typo|malta}}'' for {{IPA|/mm/}}).\n\n====Irregularly formed letters====\nThere are additional letters that do not have regular shapes. They may represent, e.g., {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}. Their use varies considerably from mode to mode. Some aficionados have added more letters not found in Tolkien's writings for use in their modes.\n\n===Tehtar===\n[[File:Tehtar.png|thumb|Tehtar]]\nA ''tehta'' (Quenya \"marking\") is a [[diacritic]] placed above or below the tengwa. They can represent vowels, consonant doubling, or nasal sound.\n\nAs Tolkien explained in the ''ROTK'' appendix, the ''tehtar'' for vowels resemble Latin diacritics: circumflex (\u00ee) {{IPA|/a/}}, acute (\u00ed) {{IPA|/e/}}, dot (i) {{IPA|/i/}}, left curl (\u0131\u0314) {{IPA|/o/}}, and right curl (\u0131\u0313) {{IPA|/u/}}. Long vowels, excepting {{IPA|/a/}}, may be indicated by doubling the signs. Some languages from which {{IPA|/o/}} is absent or in which compared to {{IPA|/u/}} it appears sparsely, such as the [[Black Speech]], use left curl for {{IPA|/u/}}; other languages swap the signs for {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}.\n\nA vowel occurring alone is drawn on the vowel carrier, which resembles [[dotless i]] (\u0131) for a short vowel or dotless j (\u0237) for a long vowel.\n\n== Modes ==\n[[File:Tengwar modi2 EN.svg|thumb|Three modes of tengwar<br>''Yellow: Classical mode''<br>''Pink: Mode of Beleriand''<br>''Grey: General mode'']]\nJust as with any [[alphabet]]ic writing system, every specific language written in tengwar requires a specific [[orthography]], depending on the [[phonology]] of that language. These tengwar orthographies are usually called ''modes''. Some modes follow pronunciation, while others follow traditional orthography.\n\nSome modes map the basic consonants to {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} (classical mode in chart at right), while others use them to represent {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} (general mode at right).\n\n===\u00d3matehtar===\nIn some modes, called ''\u00f3matehtar'' (or ''vowel tehtar'') modes, the vowels are represented with [[diacritic]]s called ''tehtar'' (Quenya for 'signs'; corresponding [[Grammatical number|singular]]: ''tehta'', 'sign'). These \u00f3matehtar modes can be loosely considered [[abjad]]s rather than true [[alphabet]]s. In some \u00f3matehtar modes, the consonant signs feature an inherent vowel. These \u00f3matehtar modes can be considered [[abugida|alphasyllabaries]].\n\n''\u00d3matehtar'' modes can vary in that the vowel stroke can be placed either on top of the consonant preceding it, as in [[Quenya]], or on the consonant following, as in [[Sindarin]], English, and the notorious Black Speech inscription on the One Ring. The other main difference is in the fourth ''tyell\u00eb'' below, where those letters with raised stems and doubled bows can be either voiced fricatives, as in Sindarin (general mode at right), or nasalized stops, as in Quenya (classical mode).\n\n===Full writing===\nIn the ''full writing'' modes, the consonants and the vowels are represented by Tengwar. Only one such mode is well known. It is called the \"mode of [[Beleriand]]\" and one can read it on the [[Moria (Middle-earth)#West-door|Doors of Durin]].\n\n===Modes for various languages===\nSince the publication of the first official description of the Tengwar at the end of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', others have created modes for other languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]]. Modes have also been devised for other [[constructed language]]s; [[Esperanto]] and [[Lojban]].\n\nTolkien has used multiple modes for English, including full writing and \u00f3matehtar alphabetic modes, phonetic full modes and phonetic \u00f3matehtar modes known from documents published after his death.<references group=. />\n\n== Encoding schemes ==\n\n===Legacy encoding===\nThe contemporary [[de facto]] standard in the tengwar user community maps the tengwar characters onto the [[ISO 8859-1]] character encoding following the example of the tengwar typefaces by Dan Smith. This implies a major flaw: If no corresponding tengwar font is installed, a [[mojibake|string of nonsense characters]] appears.\n\nSince there are not enough places in ISO 8859-1's 191 codepoints for all the signs used in tengwar orthography, certain signs are included in a \"tengwar A\" font which also maps its characters on ISO 8859-1, overlapping with the first font.\n\nFor each tengwar diacritic, there are four different codepoints that are used depending on the width of the character which bears it.\n\nOther tengwar typefaces with this encoding include [http://www.dafont.com/tengwar-annatar.font Johan Winge's Tengwar Annatar], [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/parmaite.htm M\u00e5ns Bj\u00f6rkman's Tengwar Parmait\u00eb], [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027083304/http://geocities.com/enrombell/eng_dir/Index.htm  Enrique Mombello's Tengwar \u00c9lfica] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20061023195729/http://tengwarformal.limes.com.pl/ Michal Nowakowski's Tengwar Formal] (note that most of these differ in details).\n\nThe following sample shows the first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] written in English, according to the traditional [[English orthography]]. It should look similar to the picture at the [[#top|top of the page]], but if no tengwar font is installed, it will appear as a jumble of characters because the corresponding ISO 8859-1 characters will appear instead.\n\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Eldamar', 'Tengwar Noldor', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Elfica', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Gothika'; font-size: 150%; line-height: 150%\">\nj#\u00b8 9t&5# w`Vb%_ 6EO w6Y5 e7`V`V 2{( z\u00e8Vj# 5% 2x%51T`\u00db 2{( 7v%1+- 4hR 7EO 2{$yYO2 y4% 7]F85^ 2{( z5^8I`B5$I( 2{( dyYj2 zE1 1yY6E2_ 5^( 5#4^(7 5% `C 8q7T1T W w74^(692^H -- </blockquote>\nNote: Some browsers may not display these characters properly.\n\n===Unicode===\n\nA proposal has been made by [[Michael Everson]] to include the tengwar in the [[Unicode]] standard. The codepoints are subject to change; the range {{U+|016080}} to U+0160FF in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane|SMP]] is tentatively allocated for tengwar according to the current [https://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp/ Unicode roadmap].\n\n===ConScript Unicode Registry===\n\n{{Infobox Unicode block\n|rangestart = E000\n|rangeend   = E07F\n|assigned   = 93\n|script1    = Artificial Scripts\n|alphabets  = Tengwar\n|sources   = [[ConScript Unicode Registry|CSUR]]\n|note       = Part of the Private-Use Area, font conflicts possible<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/tengwar.html | title=Tengwar: U+E000 - U+E07F | work=ConScript Unicode Registry | author= Michael Everson | accessdate=2017-03-13}}</ref>\n}}\n\nTengwar are currently included in the unofficial [[ConScript Unicode Registry]] (CSUR), which assigns codepoints in the [[Private Use Area]].

R. R. Tolkien]]. \nWithin the fictional context of [[Tolkien's legendarium]], the tengwar were invented by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[F\u00ebanor]], and used first to write the Elven tongues [[Quenya]] and [[Telerin]]. Later a great number of [[languages of Middle-earth]] were written using the tengwar, including [[Sindarin]]. Tolkien used tengwar to write [[English language|English]]: most of Tolkien's tengwar samples are actually in English.\n\n== Internal history and terminology ==\nAccording to ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'' (Appendix D to ''Quendi and Eldar''), F\u00ebanor, when he created his script, introduced a change in terminology. He called a letter, i.e. a written representation of a spoken phoneme (''tengw\u00eb''), a  ''tengwa''. Previously, any letter or symbol had been called a ''sarat'' (from ''*sar'' \"incise\"). The alphabet of R\u00famil of Tirion, on which F\u00ebanor supposedly based his own work, was known as [[Sarati]]. It later became known as \"Tengwar of R\u00famil\".\n\nThe plural of ''tengwa'' was ''tengwar'', and this is the name by which F\u00ebanor's system became known. Since, however, in commonly used modes, an individual ''tengwa'' was equivalent to a consonant, the term ''tengwar'' in popular use became equivalent to \"consonant sign\", and the vowel signs were known as ''\u00f3matehtar''. By loan-translation, the tengwar became known as ''t\u00eew'' (singular ''t\u00eaw'') in Sindarin, when they were introduced to [[Beleriand]]. The letters of the earlier alphabet native to Sindarin were called ''[[cirth]]'' (singular ''certh'', probably from ''*kirte'' \"cutting\", and thus semantically analogous to Quenya ''sarat''). This term was loaned into exilic Quenya as ''certa'', plural ''certar''.\n\n==External history==\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[sarati]], a script developed by Tolkien in the late 1910s and described in ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]] 13'', anticipates many features of the tengwar: vowel representation by [[diacritic]]s (which is found in many tengwar varieties); different tengwar shapes; and a few correspondences between sound features and letter shape features (though inconsistent).\n\nEven closer to the tengwar is the Valmaric script, described in ''Parma Eldalamberon 14'', which Tolkien used from about 1922 to 1925. It features many tengwar shapes, the inherent vowel {{IPA|[a]}} found in some tengwar varieties, and the tables in the samples V12 and V13 show an arrangement that is very similar to one of the primary tengwar in the classical Quenya \"mode\".\n\n[[Jim Allan (author)|Jim Allan]] (''An Introduction to Elvish'', {{ISBN|0-905220-10-2}}) compared the tengwar with the ''Universal Alphabet'' of [[Francis Lodwick]] of 1686, both on grounds of the correspondence between shape features and sound features, and of the actual letter shapes.\n\n===Tengwar===\n[[Image:One Ring inscription.svg|thumb|300px|The inscription on the [[One Ring]], written in the [[Black Speech]] of [[Mordor]] using tengwar]]\n\nThe tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s. ''The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription'', the first published Tengwar sample, dates to 1937 (''[[The Hobbit]]'', most editions with colour plates). The full explanation of the tengwar was published in Appendix E of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1955.\n\nThe ''Mellonath Daeron Index of Tengwar Specimina'' (DTS) lists most of the known samples of tengwar by Tolkien.\n\nThere are only a few known samples predating publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'' (many of them published posthumously):\n\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS1 DTS 1]&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription'', published 1937\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS13 DTS 13]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Middle Page from the Book of Mazarbul''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS14 DTS 14]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Last Page from the Book of Mazarbul, Last Line'', this and the above one originally prepared for inclusion in ''The Lord of the Rings''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS15 DTS 15]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Steinborg Drawing Title''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS22 DTS 22]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Ilbereth's Greeting'' from [[The Father Christmas Letters]], dating to 1937\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS24 DTS 24]&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Treebeard Page''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS50 DTS 50]/[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS51 51]&nbsp;\u2013 ''Edwin Lowdham's Manuscript'' from [[The Notion Club Papers]] has [[Old English language]] text written in tengwar (with a few [[Ad\u00fbnaic]] and Quenya words), dating to 1945/6.\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS10 DTS 10]&nbsp;\u2013 The Brogan Tengwa-greetings, appearing in ''[[The Letters of J. R. R.

R. R. Tolkien'', as well as [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS23 DTS 23]&nbsp;\u2013 ''So L\u00fathien'', a page of the English ''Lay of Leithian'' text facsimiled in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'':299.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Tengwar alphabet1.png|thumb|200px|The tengwar table, with the name of each ''tengwa''.]]\n\n=== Letters ===\nThe most notable characteristic of the tengwar script is that the shapes of the letters correspond to the [[distinctive feature]]s of the sounds they represent. The Quenya consonant system has five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]], and [[glottal consonant|glottal]]. The velars distinguish between plain and labialized (that is, articulated with rounded lips, or followed by a {{IPA|[w]}} sound). Each point of articulation, and the corresponding tengwa series, has a name in the classical Quenya mode. Dental sounds are called  ''Tincot\u00e9ma'' and are represented with the tengwar in column I. Labial sounds are called ''Parmat\u00e9ma'', and represented by the column II tengwar; velar sounds are called ''Calmat\u00e9ma'', represented by column III; and labialized velar sounds are called ''Quesset\u00e9ma'', represented by the ''tengwar'' of column IV. Palatal sounds are called ''Tyelpet\u00e9ma'' and have no tengwa series of their own, but are represented by column III letters with an added diacritic for following {{IPA|[j]}}.\n\nSimilarly shaped letters reflect not only similar places of articulation, but also similar manners of articulation. In the classical Quenya mode, row 1 represents voiceless stops, row 2 voiced prenasalized stops, row 3 voiceless fricatives, row 4 voiceless prenasalized stops, row 5 nasal stops, and row 6 approximants.<ref>The Complete Tolkien Companion, Third Edition.  Tyler, J.E.A.  New York: St. Martins, 2004.</ref>\n\n====Regularly formed letters====\nMost letters are constructed by a combination of two basic shapes: a vertical '''stem''' (either long or short) and either one or two rounded '''bows''' (which may or may not be underscored, and may be on the left or right of the stem).\n\nThese principal letters are divided into four series (\"t\u00e9mar\") that correspond to the main places of articulation and into six grades (\"tyeller\") that correspond to the main [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]. Both vary among modes.\n\nEach series is headed by the basic signs composed of a vertical stem descending below the line, and a single bow. These basic signs represent the [[phonation|voice]]less [[stop consonant]]s for that series. For the classical Quenya mode, they are {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}, and the series are named ''tincot\u00e9ma'', ''parmat\u00e9ma'', ''calmat\u00e9ma'', and ''quesset\u00e9ma'', respectively; t\u00e9ma means \"series\" in Quenya.\n\nIn rows of the ''general use'', there are the following correspondences between letter shapes and manners of articulation:\n* Doubling the bow turns the [[phonation|voiceless consonant]] into a voiced one.\n* Raising the stem above the line turns it into the corresponding [[fricative consonant|fricative]].\n* Shortening it (so it is only the height of the bow) creates the corresponding [[nasal consonant|nasal]]. In most modes, the signs with shortened stem and single bow do not correspond to the [[phonation|voiceless]] nasals, but to the [[approximant]]s.\n\nIn addition to these variations of the tengwar shapes, there is yet another variation, the use of stems that are extended both above and below the line. This shape may correspond to other consonant variations required. Except for some English abbreviations, it is not used in any of the better known tengwar modes, but it occurs in a [[Qenya]] <!--sic--> mode where the tengwa Parma with extended stem is used for {{IPA|/pt/}} and the tengwa Calma with extended stem is used for {{IPA|/kt/}}.<ref>See [[Parma Eldalamberon]] 19 (2010), pp. 41\u201343.</ref> The tengwar with raised stems sometimes occur in [[glyph]] variants that look like extended stems, as seen in the inscription of the [[One Ring]].\n\nHere is an example from the ''parmat\u00e9ma'' (the signs with a closed bow on the right side) in the \"general use\" of the tengwar:\n[[Image:Parmat\u00e9ma.png|right|60px]]\n* The basic sign, named ''parma'', (with descending stem) represents {{IPA|/p/}} (it happens to look much like the Latin letter ''P'').\n* With the bow doubled, ''umbar'', it represents {{IPA|/b/}}.\n* With a raised stem, ''formen'', it represents {{IPA|/f/}}.\n* With a raised stem and a doubled bow, ''ampa'', it represents generally {{IPA|/v/}} but possibly {{IPA|/mp/}} (depending upon the language).\n* With a short stem and double bow, ''{{not a typo|malta}}'', it represents {{IPA|/m/}}.\n* With short stem and single bow, ''vala'', it represents {{IPA|/w/}}, or {{IPA|/v/}} if that has the phonological behaviour of a sonorant (as e.g. in Quenya).\n\nIn some languages such as Quenya, which do not contain any voiced fricatives other than \"v\", the raised stem + doubled bow row is used for the very common nasal+stop sequences (''nt'', ''mp'', ''nk'', ''nqu''). In such cases, the \"w\" sign in the previous paragraph is used for \"v\". In the mode of Beleriand, found on the door to [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], the bottom ''tyell\u00eb'' is used for nasals (e.g., ''vala'' is used for {{IPA|/m/}}) and the fifth ''tyell\u00eb'' for doubled nasals (''{{not a typo|malta}}'' for {{IPA|/mm/}}).\n\n====Irregularly formed letters====\nThere are additional letters that do not have regular shapes. They may represent, e.g., {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}. Their use varies considerably from mode to mode. Some aficionados have added more letters not found in Tolkien's writings for use in their modes.\n\n===Tehtar===\n[[File:Tehtar.png|thumb|Tehtar]]\nA ''tehta'' (Quenya \"marking\") is a [[diacritic]] placed above or below the tengwa. They can represent vowels, consonant doubling, or nasal sound.\n\nAs Tolkien explained in the ''ROTK'' appendix, the ''tehtar'' for vowels resemble Latin diacritics: circumflex (\u00ee) {{IPA|/a/}}, acute (\u00ed) {{IPA|/e/}}, dot (i) {{IPA|/i/}}, left curl (\u0131\u0314) {{IPA|/o/}}, and right curl (\u0131\u0313) {{IPA|/u/}}. Long vowels, excepting {{IPA|/a/}}, may be indicated by doubling the signs. Some languages from which {{IPA|/o/}} is absent or in which compared to {{IPA|/u/}} it appears sparsely, such as the [[Black Speech]], use left curl for {{IPA|/u/}}; other languages swap the signs for {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}.\n\nA vowel occurring alone is drawn on the vowel carrier, which resembles [[dotless i]] (\u0131) for a short vowel or dotless j (\u0237) for a long vowel.\n\n== Modes ==\n[[File:Tengwar modi2 EN.svg|thumb|Three modes of tengwar<br>''Yellow: Classical mode''<br>''Pink: Mode of Beleriand''<br>''Grey: General mode'']]\nJust as with any [[alphabet]]ic writing system, every specific language written in tengwar requires a specific [[orthography]], depending on the [[phonology]] of that language. These tengwar orthographies are usually called ''modes''. Some modes follow pronunciation, while others follow traditional orthography.\n\nSome modes map the basic consonants to {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} (classical mode in chart at right), while others use them to represent {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} (general mode at right).\n\n===\u00d3matehtar===\nIn some modes, called ''\u00f3matehtar'' (or ''vowel tehtar'') modes, the vowels are represented with [[diacritic]]s called ''tehtar'' (Quenya for 'signs'; corresponding [[Grammatical number|singular]]: ''tehta'', 'sign'). These \u00f3matehtar modes can be loosely considered [[abjad]]s rather than true [[alphabet]]s. In some \u00f3matehtar modes, the consonant signs feature an inherent vowel. These \u00f3matehtar modes can be considered [[abugida|alphasyllabaries]].\n\n''\u00d3matehtar'' modes can vary in that the vowel stroke can be placed either on top of the consonant preceding it, as in [[Quenya]], or on the consonant following, as in [[Sindarin]], English, and the notorious Black Speech inscription on the One Ring. The other main difference is in the fourth ''tyell\u00eb'' below, where those letters with raised stems and doubled bows can be either voiced fricatives, as in Sindarin (general mode at right), or nasalized stops, as in Quenya (classical mode).\n\n===Full writing===\nIn the ''full writing'' modes, the consonants and the vowels are represented by Tengwar. Only one such mode is well known. It is called the \"mode of [[Beleriand]]\" and one can read it on the [[Moria (Middle-earth)#West-door|Doors of Durin]].\n\n===Modes for various languages===\nSince the publication of the first official description of the Tengwar at the end of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', others have created modes for other languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]]. Modes have also been devised for other [[constructed language]]s; [[Esperanto]] and [[Lojban]].\n\nTolkien has used multiple modes for English, including full writing and \u00f3matehtar alphabetic modes, phonetic full modes and phonetic \u00f3matehtar modes known from documents published after his death.<references group=. />\n\n== Encoding schemes ==\n\n===Legacy encoding===\nThe contemporary [[de facto]] standard in the tengwar user community maps the tengwar characters onto the [[ISO 8859-1]] character encoding following the example of the tengwar typefaces by Dan Smith. This implies a major flaw: If no corresponding tengwar font is installed, a [[mojibake|string of nonsense characters]] appears.\n\nSince there are not enough places in ISO 8859-1's 191 codepoints for all the signs used in tengwar orthography, certain signs are included in a \"tengwar A\" font which also maps its characters on ISO 8859-1, overlapping with the first font.\n\nFor each tengwar diacritic, there are four different codepoints that are used depending on the width of the character which bears it.\n\nOther tengwar typefaces with this encoding include [http://www.dafont.com/tengwar-annatar.font Johan Winge's Tengwar Annatar], [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/parmaite.htm M\u00e5ns Bj\u00f6rkman's Tengwar Parmait\u00eb], [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027083304/http://geocities.com/enrombell/eng_dir/Index.htm  Enrique Mombello's Tengwar \u00c9lfica] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20061023195729/http://tengwarformal.limes.com.pl/ Michal Nowakowski's Tengwar Formal] (note that most of these differ in details).\n\nThe following sample shows the first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] written in English, according to the traditional [[English orthography]]. It should look similar to the picture at the [[#top|top of the page]], but if no tengwar font is installed, it will appear as a jumble of characters because the corresponding ISO 8859-1 characters will appear instead.\n\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Eldamar', 'Tengwar Noldor', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Elfica', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Gothika'; font-size: 150%; line-height: 150%\">\nj#\u00b8 9t&5# w`Vb%_ 6EO w6Y5 e7`V`V 2{( z\u00e8Vj# 5% 2x%51T`\u00db 2{( 7v%1+- 4hR 7EO 2{$yYO2 y4% 7]F85^ 2{( z5^8I`B5$I( 2{( dyYj2 zE1 1yY6E2_ 5^( 5#4^(7 5% `C 8q7T1T W w74^(692^H -- </blockquote>\nNote: Some browsers may not display these characters properly.\n\n===Unicode===\n\nA proposal has been made by [[Michael Everson]] to include the tengwar in the [[Unicode]] standard.

Grant''' began on March 4, 1869, when [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|18th]] [[president of the United States]], and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and he presided over much of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] became president after defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Horatio Seymour]] in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. He was reelected in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] in a [[landslide victory]], overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], which nominated [[Horace Greeley]] to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] after the contested [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].\n\nReconstruction took precedence during Grant's two terms of office. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] caused widespread violence throughout the South against African Americans. By 1870, all former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states had been readmitted into the United States and were represented in Congress. However Democrats, or former slave owners, violently refused to accept that freedmen were citizens, who were granted suffrage by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. By 1871 Klan activity was becoming out of control, while Grant and Congress created the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and had passed three [[Force Acts]]. Grant and his Attorney General [[Amos T. Akerman]] began a crackdown on Klan in the South, starting in South Carolina, making arrests and convictions, causing the Klan to demobilize and ensuring a fair election for 1872. Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers, Grant was self-reliant in choosing his [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]]. He relied heavily on former Army associates, who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics. Numerous scandals plagued his administration, including allegations of bribery, fraud, and cronyism. In 1872, Grant signed into law an [[Act of Congress]] that established [[Yellowstone National Park]], the nation's first National Park.\n\nA strong economy, reduction of the national debt, federal spending, tariffs, and the federal workforce, aided Grant in getting reelected. Congress established a de facto deflationary [[gold standard]] that reduced the number of [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]] in the national economy.\nHowever, financial overinvestment in railroad construction, caused the [[Panic of 1873]], and economic turmoil. The [[Long Depression]] that followed, and Grant's veto of an inflation bill, turned public opinion against him. Democrats regained control of the House in the [[United States elections, 1874|1874 elections]]. While scandals escalated, reformers appointed by Grant were able to clean up some federal departments. Most notably, Secretary of the Treasury [[Benjamin Bristow]] prosecuted the [[Whiskey Ring]], leading to the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, [[Orville E. Babcock]].  Grant continued to support Reconstruction, and he signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which banned discrimination in [[public accommodations]]. Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] suddenly resigned office in February 1876; afterwards impeached by the House for taking kickbacks. When Grant left office in 1877, [[Redeemers]] in the South, controlled all state governments.\n\nThe United States was at peace with the world throughout Grant's eight years in office, but his handling of foreign policy was uneven. Tensions with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the West continued. Under the talented Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]], the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] restored relations with Britain and resolved the contentious [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]], while the [[Virginius Affair|''Virginius'' Affair]] with [[Spain]] was settled peacefully. Grant attempted to [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annex]] the Caribbean island of [[Santo Domingo]], but the annexation was blocked by the Senate.\n\nWith the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans. Grant pursued a ''Peace'' policy with Native Americans, but persistent western expansion by settlers made conflict difficult to avoid. Grant presided over the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] and other clashes with the Native Americans. Grant's presidency was traditionally denounced by historians due to corruption charges among subordinates, despite efforts of reform in his administration. His presidential reputation has greatly risen over the past few decades among historians who have noted that Grant advanced a modern presidency, that included a reformed Indian policy, [[African American]] civil rights, the first Civil Service Commission, and protected women under federal law.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Election of 1868==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1868}}\n[[File:Grant-Colfax.png|right|thumb|250px|Grant-Colfax Campaign Poster 1868]]\nGrant's rise in political popularity among Republicans was based on his Union military service during the Civil War, his successful generalship that defeated [[Robert E.

The Republican Party delegates unanimously nominated Ulysses S. Grant (''Ohio'') the Republican Party presidential candidate at its May convention held in Chicago.  [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Schuyler Colfax]] (''Indiana''), was chosen its vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=244}} The 1868 Republican Party platform advocated enfranchisement of [[African Americans]] in the South but kept the issue open in the North. It opposed using [[Greenback (money)|greenbacks]], only gold, to redeem U.S. bonds, encouraged immigration, endorsed full rights for naturalized citizens, and favored radical reconstruction as distinct from the more lenient policy espoused by President [[Andrew Johnson]].{{sfn|Republican Party National Platform May 1868}} In Grant's acceptance letter he said: \"Let us have peace.\"{{sfn|Simpson|2014|page=246}}{{efn|Historian Brooks Simpson says these four simple words expressed the \"innermost desires of many Americans.\"{{sfn|Simpson|2014|page=246}}}} These words became the Republican popular mantra.{{sfnm|Simpson|2014|1p=246|Simon|2002|2p=244}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1868.svg|thumb|left|200px|Electoral Vote Results 1868]]\nThe Democratic Party, divided by the Civil War, reunited and was determined to take back the presidency.

[[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], leader of the Ku Klux Klan, attended its proceedings.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} The party delegates finally nominated [[Horatio Seymour]] (''New York'') the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Seymour was the war governor of New York but had been reluctant to send Union troops to the war front, favored the anti-war [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], and ineptly handled the New York draft riots. To counter Seymour's political liabilities, the delegates nominated [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.|Francis P. Blair]] (''Missouri'') for vice president. Although Blair was a Union soldier who served under General [[William T.

It advocated former Confederates be allowed to hold elective offices.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}}\n\nGrant won the presidential election with an overwhelming [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory, receiving 214 votes to Seymour's 80.

Washburne]] Secretary of State, as a friendship courtesy, only to briefly serve office, and then be appointed Minister to France. Grant then appointed conservative [[Hamilton Fish]], former governor of New York, to succeed Washburne.  Grant appointed wealthy New York merchant [[Alexander T. Stewart]] Secretary of Treasury, but he was quickly found to be disqualified by a federal law that prohibited anyone in office to engage in commerce. When Congress would not amend the law, an embarrassed Grant appointed Massachusetts Congressman [[George S.

The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb the power of President [[Andrew Johnson]] in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. To bolster the repeal effort, Grant declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned. On March 9, 1869, the House repealed the law outright, but the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill and only offered Grant a temporary suspension of the law. When Grant objected, the Senate Republican caucus met, and proposed allowing the President to have a free hand in choosing and removing his own cabinet. The Senate Judiciary Committee wrote the new bill. A muddled compromise was reached by the House and Senate.

Grant appointed [[Amos T. Akerman]] as Attorney General and [[Benjamin H. Bristow]] as America's first Solicitor General. Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the early 1870s. Grant appointed [[Hiram C. Whitley]] as director of the new Secret Service Agency in 1869, after he had successfully arrested 12 Klansmen in Georgia who would murdered a leading local Republican official. Whitley used talented detectives who infiltrated and broke up KKK units in North Carolina and Alabama. However they could not penetrate the main hotbed of KKK activity in upstate South Carolina. Grant sent in Army troops but Whitley's agents learned they were lying below until the troops were withdrawn. Whitley warned Akerman, who convinced Grant to declare martial law and send in US marshals backed by federal troops to arrest 500 Klansmen; hundred more fled the state, and hundreds of others surrendered in return for leniency.<ref>Charles Lane, ''Freedom's Detective: The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror'' (2019) pp 181-84.</ref><ref>Jerry West, ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865-1877'' (2002).</ref>\n\nIn the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in [[Albany, New York]]. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \"better\" or \"stronger\" than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=542\u201347}} Akerman's successor, [[George Henry Williams|George H.

This law was designed to keep the [[Redeemers]] from attacking or threatening African Americans. This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.{{sfn|Scaturro|2006}}\n\nOn January 13, 1871, Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the South. On March 20, Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \"secure life, liberty, and property, and the enforcement of law, in all parts of the United States.\"{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=346}} Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=346}} Congress investigated the Klan's activities and eventually passed the [[Force Act of 1871]] to allow prosecution of the Klan. This Act, also known as the \"Ku Klux Klan Act\" and written by Representative [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan.

Red Cloud, at a previous meeting with Secretary Cox and Commissioner Parker, complained that promised rations and arms for hunting had not been delivered. Afterward, Grant and Cox lobbied Congress for the promised supplies and rations. Congress responded and on July 15, 1870, Grant signed the Indian Appropriations Act into law that appropriated the tribal monies. Two days after Spotted Tail urged the Grant administration to keep white settlers from invading Native reservation land, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \"keep intruders off by military force if necessary\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=270-272}} In 1871, Grant signed another Indians Appropriations Act that ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations.

It ensured that all public debts, particularly war bonds, would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks.

In 1868, a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours; however, much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced. To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \"no reduction shall be made in the wages\" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers.<ref>Grant (1869), ''Respecting Wages of labor'', Executive Order</ref>\n\nTreasury Secretary [[George S. Boutwell]] reorganized and reformed the [[United States Treasury]] by discharging unnecessary employees, started sweeping changes in [[Bureau of Printing and Engraving]] to protect the currency from [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiters]], and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue. These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2001}} By May 1869, Boutwell reduced the national debt by $12&nbsp;million. By September the national debt was reduced by $50&nbsp;million, which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for [[United States Note|greenbacks]] and buying back wartime bonds with the currency. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the Grant administration's debt policy.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\nThe first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $292&nbsp;million in 1871 \u2013 down from $322&nbsp;million in 1869.

In 1870, Pleasonton, a Grant appointment, approved an unauthorized $60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm. Treasury Secretary [[George Boutwell]] promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office.

There were no foreign-policy disasters, and no wars to engage in. Besides Grant himself, the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[Charles Sumner]]. They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified. When Sumner stopped Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo, Grant had his vengeance by systematically destroying Sumner's power and ending his career. Historians have a high regard for the diplomatic professionalism, independence, and good judgment of Hamilton Fish. The main issues involved Britain, Canada, Santo Domingo, Cuba and Spain.  Worldwide, it was peaceful era, with no major wars directly affecting the United States. In Europe, [[Otto von Bismarck]] was leading Prussia into a dominant position in the new united German Empire. After short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France ended in 1871, Bismarck was the dominant figure in Europe, and worked tirelessly and successfully to promote a peaceful continent until his removal in 1890.<ref>The main scholarly history remains [[Allan Nevins]], ''Hamilton Fish: The inner history of the Grant administration'' (two volumes 1937) 932 PP, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. the most recent scholarly survey is Charles W Calhoun, ''The Presidency of Ulysses S.

Previously in 1868, President [[Andrew Johnson]] had proposed annexation but Congress refused.  In July 1869 Grant sent [[Orville E. Babcock]] and [[Rufus Ingalls]] who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic president [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for $2&nbsp;million. To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5&nbsp;million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of [[Santo Domingo]] as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870, the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not building support in Congress or the country at large. {{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=499\u2013502}}{{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}}<ref>Harold T.

By providing a safe haven for the freedmen, he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights. Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit. He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would push Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and  Puerto Rico, and perhaps Brazil as well. {{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}} On March 15, 1870, the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]], headed by Sen.

However, Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching; as a result, Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\">Kennedy (2001), \"[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0606.html The Last Buffalo]\"</ref><ref name=POUSG_1874>Simon (2003) ''Papers of Ulysses S.

The demand was for boots for European armies, or machine belts attached to steam engines. Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo. Native Americans protested at the \"wanton destruction\" of their food supply. Between 1872 in 1874, the buffalo herd south of the Platte River yielded 4.4 million kills by white hunters, and about 1 million animals killed by Indians.<ref>Richard White, ''The Republic for which it Stands'' (2017) p 296.</ref>  Popular concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegally for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adopt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\"/> Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to open pasture land for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=536\u201338}}\n\n===Corruption and reform===\n{{main|Ulysses S.

The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold, thus driving its price. Grant and Secretary of Treasury [[George S. Boutwell]] found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4&nbsp;million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=481\u201390}}\n\n====Civil service commission and reform====\nThe reform of the spoils system of political patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant presidency, that would take on the fervor of a religious revival.{{sfn|White|2017|p=531}} The distribution of federal jobs by Congressional legislators was considered vital for their reelection to Congress.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Grant required that all applicants to federal jobs apply directly to the Department heads, rather than the president.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Two of Grant's appointments, Secretary of Interior [[Jacob D.

Boutwell]] put in place examinations in their respected departments advocated by reformers.{{sfn|White|2016|p=531}}  Grant and all reformed agreed that the prevailing system of appointments was unsound, for it maximized party advantage and minimized efficiency and the nonpartisan interest of good government. Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure.<ref>John Y. Simon, \"Ulysses S. Grant and Civil Service Reform,\" ''Hayes Historical Journal'' (1984) 4#3 pp 8\u201315.</ref>\n\nGrant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first [[United States Civil Service Commission]]. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. [[Chester A. Arthur]] who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions.<ref>Howe (1935), p. 48, 295</ref> However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether ''patronage'', meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labeled corruption.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=587\u201389}}\n\nThe movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives: to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy and to check the power of President Johnson. Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress, he refused, saying: \n{{Quote|Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress.

These were known as [[Star routes|Star Routes]] because an asterisk was given on official [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] documents. These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while [[John Creswell]], Grant's 1869 appointment, was [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was [[Censure in the United States|censured]] by the minority House report. A $40,000 bribe to the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]] by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation. In 1876, another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years.<ref>Grossman 2003, pp. 308\u2013309.</ref>\n\n====New York Custom House Ring====\n[[File:That salary grab-\"You took it\" LCCN93500053.tif|thumb|180px|\"Salary Grab\" caption: \"That salary grab \u2013 'You took it'\" ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'' December 27, 1873]] \nPrior to the presidential election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments [[Moses H.

Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for the previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874.

When Republicans gathered for their [[1872 Republican National Convention|1872 national convention]] he was unanimously nominated for a second term. [[Henry Wilson]] was selected as his running mate over scandal-tainted Vice President Schuyler Colfax. The party platform advocated high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states.\n\nDuring Grant's first term a significant number of Republicans had become completely disillusioned with the party. Weary of the scandals and opposed to several of Grant's policies, split from the party to form the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]. At the party's only national convention, held in May 1872 ''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor Horace Greeley was nominated for president, and [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] was nominated for vice president. They advocated civil service reform, a low tariff, and granting amnesty to former Confederate soldiers. They also wanted to end reconstruction and restore local self-government in the South.\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1872.svg|thumb|left|Electoral Vote Results 1872]]\n\nThe Democrats, who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own, saw an opportunity to consolidate the anti-Grant vote and jumped on the Greeley bandwagon, reluctantly adopting Greeley and Brown as their nominees.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\">Rhodes 1906, [https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst05rhodgoog <!-- quote=intitle:History intitle:of intitle:the intitle:United intitle:States inauthor:Rhodes inauthor:James. --> v. 7].</ref> It is the only time in American history when a major party endorsed the candidate of a third party.\n\nWhile Grant, like incumbent presidents before him, did not campaign, an efficient party organization composed of thousands of patronage appointees, did so on his behalf. [[Frederick Douglass]] supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=550}}<ref>Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', pp. 308, 309</ref> Greeley embarked on a five-state campaign tour in late September, during which he delivered nearly 200 speeches. His campaign was plagued by misstatements and embarrassing moments.\n\nHowever, because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley was no match for Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes and received 55.8 percent of the popular vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both houses of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard-fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\" />\n\n==Second term 1873\u20131877==\n[[File:Grant-Chase-1873.jpg|thumb|Grant's second inauguration as president by Chief Justice [[Salmon P.

Subsequently, the inaugural ball ended early when the food froze. Wilson died 2 years, 263 days into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. Departing from the White House, a parade escorted Grant down the newly paved Pennsylvania Avenue, which was all decorated with banners and flags, on to the swearing-in ceremony in front of the Capitol building. Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] administered the presidential oath of office. This was one of the coldest inaugurations in U.S. history, with the temperature at only 6 degrees at sunrise. After the swearing-in ceremony the inaugural parade commenced down Pennsylvania. The [[The Washington Star|''Evening Star'']] observed. \"The private stands and windows along the entire route were crowded to excess.\" The parade consisted of a variety of military units along with marching bands, and civic organizations. The military units, in their fancy regalia, were the most noticeable. Altogether there were approximately 12,000 marchers who participated, including several units of African-American soldiers. At the inaugural ball there were some 6,000 people in attendance. Great care was taken to ensure that Grant's inaugural ball would be in spacious quarters and would feature an elegant assortment of appetizers, food, and champagne. A large temporary wooden building was constructed at Judiciary Square to accommodate the event. Grant arrived around 11:30pm and the dancing began.<ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp. 471\u2013473</ref>{{sfn|Streets of Washington|2017}}<ref>[[#ames|Ames, 1879]], pp. 272, 276</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\nGrant was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 24\u201325}} He proactively used military and [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other 19th-century president. He used his full powers to weaken the [[Ku Klux Klan]], reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed [[James Milton Turner]] as the first African American minister to a foreign nation.<ref name=\"Kremer\"/> Grant's relationship with [[Charles Sumner]], the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.<ref>David Herbert Donald, ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'' (1970) ch 12</ref>\n\nConservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections. With the destruction of the Klan in 1872, new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South. In Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana, the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]] operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan. Their goals were to oust the Republicans, return Conservative whites to power, and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them. Being loyal to his veterans, Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 25}}\n\nPolygamy, Chinese prostitution, support of Jewish people, and secular education were also issues during Reconstruction.\n\n====Colfax Massacre====\n{{main|Colfax Massacre}}\nAfter the November 4, 1872, election, [[Louisiana]] was a split state. In a controversial election, two candidates were claiming victory as governor. Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans. The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] as the victor, while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator [[William P. Kellogg]]. Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13, 1873. A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated. The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office. Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg. On March 4, Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg's state militia defeated McEnry's fusionist party's insurrection.<ref>Keith 2007, p. 100.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Union as It Was.jpg|thumb|150px|Louisiana White League units in 1874 to terrorized black Republicans]]\nA dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] courthouse in [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]]. Kellogg's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops. Then on April 13, White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured. A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg. On April 21, Grant sent in the U.S. [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] to restore order. On May 22, Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana. On May 31, McEnry finally told his followers to obey \"peremptory orders\" of the President. The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana, except, ironically, [[Grant Parish]].<ref>Lane 2008, p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas====\n{{main|Brooks\u2013Baxter War}}\nIn the fall of 1872, the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor, [[Elisha Baxter]] and [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]]. Massive fraud characterized the election, but Baxter was declared the winner and took office. Brooks never gave up; finally, in 1874, a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in. Both sides mobilized militia units, and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets. Speculation swirled as to who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks. Grant delayed, requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor, but Baxter refused to participate. On May 15, 1874, Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas, and hostilities ceased.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Johnson (1908), pp. 122\u2013168.</ref><ref>Woodward 1971, pp. 315\u2013336.</ref> In the fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter, and Republicans and the [[Redeemers]] came to power.\n\nA few months later in early 1875, Grant announced that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872. Grant did not send in troops, and Brooks never regained office. Instead, Grant appointed him to the high-paying patronage job of US postmaster in Little Rock.  Grant's legalistic approach Did resolve the conflict peacefully, but it left the Republican Party in Arkansas in total disarray, and further discredited grants reputation.<ref>Charles W.

They promised to lower city spending and taxes. Despite such intentions, the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government, which had a majority of African Americans. The White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby, the black [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]] Sheriff and tax collector. Crosby sought help from Republican Governor [[Adelbert Ames]] to regain his position as sheriff. Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position. At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443, more than half of whom were African American.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\">Rhodes (1906), v. 7, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1874, Crosby and an African-American militia approached Vicksburg. He had said that the Whites were, \"ruffians, barbarians, and political [[banditti]]\".<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" /> A series of confrontations occurred against white paramilitary forces that resulted in the deaths of 29 African Americans and 2 Whites. The White militia retained control of the County Court House and jail.\n\nOn December 21, Grant issued a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting. General [[Philip Sheridan]], based in Louisiana for this regional territory, dispatched federal troops, who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace. When questioned about the matter, Governor Ames denied that he had told Crosby to use African-American militia. On June 7, 1875, Crosby was shot to death by a white deputy while drinking in a bar. The origins of the shooting remained a mystery.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" />\n[[File:JamesLongstreet.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate General [[James Longstreet|James A.

Consisting of former Confederate soldiers, the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet's army. On September 17, Grant sent in Federal troops, and they restored the government back to Kellogg. During the following controversial election in November, passions rose high, and violence mixed with fraud were rampant; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control. The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\">Hutton 2009, pp. 262\u2013266.</ref><ref>Zuczek 2006, p. 413.</ref>\n\nGrant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent [[Phil Sheridan]] in to keep law and order in the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4, 1875, legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel [[R\u00e9gis de Trobriand]], and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. Trobriand returned to the Statehouse and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\"/>\n\n====South Carolina 1876====\n{{further|South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876}}\n\n[[File:Wade Hampton III - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate officer [[Wade Hampton III]] was supported by the terrorist group [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in the 1876 Governor's election in South Carolina.]]\nDuring the election year of 1876, South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel H.

Tensions became violent on July 8, 1876, when five African Americans were murdered at [[Hamburg, South Carolina|Hamburg]]. The rifle clubs, wearing their [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], were better armed than the blacks.

The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside [[Ellenton, South Carolina|Ellenton]]. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \"rifle club\" members to put down their weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to Grant and asked for federal intervention. The \"Cainhoy riot\" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \"Brick Church\" outside [[Cainhoy]]. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877 after President [[Rutherford B.

Blaine, who actively sought Catholic votes when he ran for president in 1884, believed that possibility of hurtful agitation on the school question should be ended. In 1875, the proposed amendment passed by a vote of 180 to 7 in the House of Representatives, but failed by four votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. Nothing like it ever became federal legislation. However many states did adopt similar amendments to their state constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven Green |title=The Second Disestablishment: Church and State in Nineteenth-Century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_KP0kQC4XIC&pg=PA296|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|isbn=9780199741595}}</ref>\n\nThe proposed Blaine Amendment text was:\n{{quote|No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.}}\n\n====Civil Rights Act of 1875====\n{{Further|Civil Rights Act of 1875}}\nThroughout his presidency, Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans, \"irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\"<ref name=1875Reyes>{{cite book |last=Reyes |first=E.

The new law was designed to allow everyone access to public eating establishments, hotels, and places of entertainment. This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States. The bill was also passed in honor of Senator [[Charles Sumner]] who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872.<ref>''The New York Times'' 1875, pp. 1\u20132.</ref> In his sixth message to Congress, he summed up his own views, \"While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution&nbsp;... will be enforced with rigor&nbsp;...

He told Utah territorial governor, [[George W. Emery]], that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons.<ref name=\"ilovehistory.utah.gov\"/> However, on December 7, 1875, after his return to Washington, Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual State of the Union address that as \"an institution polygamy should be banished from the land\u2026\"<ref>[http://www.themoralliberal.com/2011/07/05/various-presidents-on-polygamy/ Various Presidents on Polygamy (July 05, 2011)]</ref>\nGrant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women.

In his army days he traded at a local store operated by the Seligman brothers, two Jewish merchants who became Grant's lifelong friends. They [[J. & W.

Running for president in 1868 Grant publicly apologized for it.Once elected he set out to make amends.  He appointed several Jewish leaders to office, including [[Simon Wolf]] recorder of deeds in Washington D.C., and [[Edward S. Salomon]] Governor of the [[Washington Territory]].{{sfn|White|2016|pp=494\u2013495}}  Historian [[Jonathan Sarna]] argues:\n\n<blockquote>Eager to prove that he was above prejudice, Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania. Time and again, partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11, Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality.&nbsp;... Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.' During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews looked forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation.<ref>Sarna, ''When General Grant Expelled the Jews'' (2012), Introduction</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Native American affairs===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\nUnder Grant's ''Peace'' policy, wars between settlers, the federal army, and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the [[Dakota Territory]] and the completion of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], threatened to unravel Grant's Indian policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=538}}\n\nIn his second term of presidential office, Grant's fragile ''Peace'' policy came apart. Major General [[Edward Canby]] was killed in the [[Modoc War]]. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]] in 1876.{{sfn|Michno|2003|pp=295\u201396, 363}} Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=368}}\n\n====Modoc War====\n{{further|Modoc War}}\nIn January 1873, Grant's Native American peace policy was challenged. Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term, fighting broke out between the [[Modocs]] and settlers near the California-Oregon border. The Modocs, led by [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]], killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission. Sherman then sent Major General [[Edward Canby]], but Captain Jack killed him. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed. [[Alfred B. Meacham]], an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated. Grant overruled Sherman; Captain Jack was executed, and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the [[Quapaw Agency]] in the [[Indian Territory]]. This episode and the [[Great Sioux War]] undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian [[Robert M. Utley]].<ref>Utley 1984b, p. 206.</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=534\u201336}} During the peace negotiations between Brig. Gen. [[Edward Canby]] and the Modoc tribal leaders, there were more Indians in the tent then had been agreed upon. As the Indians grew more hostile, Captain Jack, said \"I talk no more.\" and shouted \"All ready.\" Captain Jack drew his revolver and fired directly into the head of Gen Canby. Brig. Gen Canby was the highest-ranking officer to be killed during the Indian Wars that took place from 1850 to 1890. Alfred Meacham, who survived the massacre, defended the Modocs who were put on trial.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=265}}\n\n====Red River War====\n{{main|Red River War}}\nIn 1874, war erupted on the southern Plains when [[Quanah Parker]], leader of the [[Comanche]], led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River, at [[Adobe Walls, Texas]]. The Army under General [[Phil Sheridan]] launched a military campaign, and, with few casualties on either side, forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies. Grant, who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals [[William T. Sherman]] and Phil Sheridan, imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida.<ref>Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 536\u2013538;</ref>\n\n====Great Sioux War====\n{{main|Great Sioux War|Battle of Little Big Horn}}\nIn 1874 gold had been discovered in the [[Black Hills]] in the [[Dakota Territory]]. White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the [[Sioux]] tribe by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] of 1868. In 1875, to avoid conflict Grant met with [[Red Cloud]], chief of the Sioux and offered $25,000 from the government to purchase the land. The offer was declined. On November 3, 1875 at a White House meeting, [[Phil Sheridan]] told the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers; Grant ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation. Sheridan used a strategy of convergence, using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation. On June 25, 1876, one of these columns, led by Colonel [[George A. Custer]] met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and part of his command was slaughtered. Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 Indians.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=296}} Custer's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation. Sheridan avenged Custer, pacified the northern Plains, and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=538\u201340}} On August 15, 1876, President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $1,000,000 in rations, while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills, except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103rd meridian. On August 28, a seven-man committee, appointed by Grant, gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance. [[Halfbreeds]] and \"squaw men\" (A white man with an Indian wife) were banished from the Sioux reservation. To receive the government rations, the Indians had to work the land. Reluctantly, on September 20, the Indian leaders, whose people were starving, agreed to the committee's demands and signed the agreement.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 260\u2013263</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary [[William W. Belknap]] (see below).{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=110\u2013111}} Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux.{{sfn|Donovan|2008|p=112}} Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]].{{sfn|Donovan|2008|p=115}} Two months after Custer's death Grant castigated him in the press, saying \"I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary \u2013 wholly unnecessary.\"{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=322\u2013323}} As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer, Grant's peace policy became militaristic; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops, two more forts were constructed, the army took over the Indian agencies and Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition.{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=321, 327}}\n\n===Financial affairs===\n\n====Panic of 1873====\n{{main|Panic of 1873}}\n[[file:The Great Financial Panic of 1873 - Closing the door of the Stock Exchange on its members, Saturday, Sept. 20th LCCN99614016.tif|right|150px|thumb|The ''NYSE'' closed on September 20, 1873]]\nBetween 1868 and 1873, the American economy was robust, primarily caused by railroad building, manufacturing expansion, and thriving agriculture production. Financial debt, however, particularly in railroad investment, spread throughout both the private and federal sectors. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=419}} The market began to break in July 1873 when the Brookyn Trust Company went broke and closed. Secretary Richardson sold gold to pay for $14 million in federal bonds.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=420}} Two months later, the [[Panic of 1873]], collapsed the national economy. On September 17, the stock market crashed, followed by the New York Warehouse & Security Company, September 18, and the [[Jay Cooke & Company]], September 19, both going bankrupt. On September 19, Grant ordered Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|Richardson]], Boutwell's replacement, to purchase $10 million in bonds. Richardson complied using greenbacks to expand the money supply. On September 20, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (''NYSE'') closed for ten days. Traveling to New York, Grant met with Richardson to consult with bankers, who gave Grant conflicting financial advice.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=421}}\n\nReturning to Washington, Grant and Richardson sent millions of greenbacks from the treasury to New York to purchase bonds, stopping the purchases on September 24. By the beginning of January 1874, Richardson had issued a total of $26 million greenbacks from the Treasury reserve, into the economy, relieving Wall Street, but not stopping the national [[Long Depression]], that would last 5 years. Thousands of businesses, depressed daily wages by 25% for three years, and brought the unemployment rate up to 14%.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=575\u201382|Chernow|2017|2pp=419-420|McFeely|1981|3p=394}}{{sfn|Oberholzer|1922|loc=3:79\u2013122}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 8}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 9}}\n\n====Inflation bill vetoed and compromise====\n[[File:Grant Inflation Bill Veto.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon by Thomas Nast: Grant congratulated for vetoing the \"inflation bill\" on April 22, 1874]]\nGrant and Richardson's mildly inflationary response to the Panic of 1873, encouraged Congress to pursue a more aggressive policy. The legality of releasing greenbacks was presumed to have been illegal. On April 14, 1874, Congress passed the ''Inflation Bill'' that set the greenback maximum at $400,000 retroactively legalizing the $26 million reserve greenbacks earlier released by the Treasury. The bill released an additional $18 million in [[United States Note|greenbacks]] up to the original $400,000,000 amount. Going further, the bill authorized an additional $46 million in banknotes and raised their maximum to $400 million.  {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=441}} Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold. Most of Grant's cabinet favored the bill in order to secure a Republican election. Grant's conservative Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill. On April 22, 1874, after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill, Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] because he believed it would destroy the nation's credit.<ref>Rhodes 1906, ch. 7, pp. 126\u2013127; Nevins (1957), ''Hamilton Fish: The Inner History of the Grant Administration. Volume: 2'', pp. 706\u2013708 711\u2013714</ref>\n\nCongress passed a compromise bill, that Grant signed on June 20, 1874. The act legalized the $26 million released by Richardson, and set the maximum of greenbacks at $382 million. Up to $55 million in national banknotes would be redistributed from states with an excess to those states that had minimal amounts. The act did little to relieve the national economy. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=445-446}}\n\n====Resumption of Specie Act====\nOn January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act, and he could not have been happier; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act. The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]]. This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1, 1879. The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the number of greenbacks in circulation. At that time there were \"paper coin\" currency worth less than $1.00, and these would be exchanged for silver coins. Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \"good as gold\". In an age without a [[Federal Reserve]] system to control inflation, this act stabilized the economy. Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=581\u201382}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 11}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{further |Hamilton Fish}}\nHistorians credit Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] with a highly effective foreign policy.

After a hasty trial, the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents, eight of whom were United States citizens; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late. War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain, heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid, retired general [[Daniel Sickles]]. Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis, and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the ''Virginius'' ship had the right to bear the United States flag. The Spanish Republic's president [[Emilio Castelar]] expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration. Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe. With Grant's approval, Spain was to surrender ''Virginius'', pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed, and salute the American flag; the episode ended quietly.<ref>Bradford 1980.</ref>\n\n====Hawaiian free trade treaty====\nIn December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, [[David Kalakaua]], who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}} Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful [[free trade treaty]] in 1875 with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economy sphere.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}}\n\n====Liberian-Grebo war====\nThe U.S. settled the war between [[Liberia]] and the native [[Grebo people]] in 1876 by dispatching the {{USS|Alaska|1868|6}} to Liberia. [[James Milton Turner]], the first African American ambassador from the United States, requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia, a former American colony. After ''Alaska'' arrived, Turner negotiated the incorporation of Grebo people into Liberian society and the ousting of foreign traders from Liberia.<ref name=\"Kremer\"/>\n\n===Midterm election 1874 ===\n{{main|United States House of Representatives elections, 1874}}\nAs the 1874 midterm elections approached, three scandals, the [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal|Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier]], the [[Salary Grab Act|Salary Grab]], and the [[Sanborn incident]] caused the public to view the Republican Party was mired in corruption. The Democratic Party held the Republican Party responsible for the [[Long Depression]]. The Republicans were divided on the currency issue. Grant, who with hard money North Eastern Republicans, vetoed an inflation bill. Grant was blamed for the nation's problems, while he was accused of wanting a third term.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=462-463}} Grant never officially campaigned, but traveled West, to emphasize his relatively popular Indian policy.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}}\n\nThe October elections, swept the Republicans from office, and was a repudation of Grant's veto. {{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=783}} In Indiana and Ohio, the Republicans suffered losses, caused by a breakaway Republican [[temperance movement]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}} The Democratic Party won the New York governorship to Democrat [[Samuel Tilden]]. The Democrats won the House, gained 182 seats, while the Republicans retained 103 seats.

Six Republican office holders were murdered in [[Coushatta, Louisiana]]. On September 14, General Longstreet, police, and black militia fought 3,500 White Leaguers who attempted to capture the statehouse in New Orleans, that ended with 32 people killed.  Grant issued a dispersal proclamation, the next day, and sent 5,000 troops and 5 gunboats to [[New Orleans]]. The [[White League]] resistance collapsed.

Grant presidential administration reforms|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals}}\nScandals and frauds continued to be exposed during Grant's second term in office, although Grant's appointments of reformers to his cabinet temporarily helped his presidential reputation, cleaned up federal departments, and defeated the notorious [[Whiskey Ring]]. Grant, however, often remained loyal to cabinet members or appointees involved in corruption or mismanagement, refusing to believe in their guilt. The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft. The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain, [[Robert C. Schenck]], using his name to promote a worked out silver mine. The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson; however, political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal.<ref name=\"Rives\">Rives 2000.</ref>\n\n====Sanborn contracts====\n{{further|Sanborn incident}}\n\nIn June 1874, Treasury Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|William A. Richardson]] gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions. The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], while Sanborn claimed these payments were \"expenses\". Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions, but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with.{{sfn|Hinsdale|1911|p=212\u201413}}\n\n====Pratt & Boyd====\nIn April 1875, it was discovered that Attorney General [[George Henry Williams|George H.

Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\n====Delano's Department of Interior ====\nBy 1875, the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior [[Columbus Delano]] was in serious disrepair with corruption and fraud. Profiteering prevailed in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents. This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant's Indian peace policy. Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow at the expense and exploitation of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Delano had allowed \"Indian Attorneys\" who were paid by Native American tribes $8.00 a day plus food and travel expenses for sham representation in Washington. Delano exempted his department from Grant's civil service reform implementation in federal offices. Delano told Grant the Interior Department was too large to implement civil service reform.\n\nDelano's son, John Delano, and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant, were discovered to have been awarded lucrative corrupt cartographical contracts by Surveyor General Silas Reed. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were qualified to hold such surveying positions. Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ulysses Simpson Grant |editor=John Y.

Bristow]] discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers. Prosecutions ensued, and many were put in prison. Grant's private Secretary [[Orville E. Babcock]] was indicted and later acquitted in trial.<ref>Rhodes 1906, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0cMTAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA182&dq=Benjamin+Bristow#v=onepage&q=Benjamin%20Bristow&f=false p. 187].</ref> Grant's new Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]] and Bristow formed an anti-corruption team to weed out criminal activity during Grant's second term. The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States, and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association. The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments, 110 convictions, and $3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department. Bristow and Pierrpont brought evidence to Grant of Babcock's involvement. Grant asked Babcock with Bristow and Pierrepont in attendance at the White House about the evidence. Babcock gave Grant an explanation that the evidence did not concern the Ring, and Grant quietly accepted Babcock's words at face value. During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders, Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock. As a result, Babcock was acquitted. However, the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation. The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant's political opponents.{{sfn|McFeely|2002|pp=406\u201316}}<ref>Garland 1898, p. 438.</ref>\n\n====Trading post ring====\n{{main|Trader post scandal}}\n\nIn March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at [[Fort Sill]]. Belknap was allowed to resign by Grant and as a result, was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=593\u201396}} In late April 1876, Grant lashed out at Lieut. Col. [[George A. Custer]], after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant's brother Orville and Sec. Belknap.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President. However, Grant refused to see him three times. When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln, he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the [[Great Sioux War|Sioux Campaign]]; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]]. However, at Terry's insistence, Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 67\u201371</ref>\n\n====Cattellism====\nIn March 1876, Secretary of Navy [[George M. Robeson]] was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company, a grain supplier, in return for real estate, loans, and payment of debts.<ref>Kennedy 2001.</ref> The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $15&nbsp;million in naval construction appropriations.<ref>Muench 2006, p. 74.</ref> Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction, the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \"Cattellism\".{{sfn|McFeely |2002|p=432}}\n\n====Safe burglary conspiracy====\nIn September 1876, [[Orville E. Babcock]], Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings, was indicted in a safe [[burglary]] [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] case and trial. In April, corrupt building contractors in Washington, D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred. Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring. Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy, but later [[acquitted]] in the trial against the burglars. Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the [[Confidence trick|swindles]] by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with.<ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\">''The New York Times'' 1876</ref><ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\"/>\n\n===Election of 1876===\nIn the [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]], the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and the Democrats nominated reformer [[Samuel Tilden]]. Results were split. Tilden received 51% of the popular vote; Hayes 48%; many black Republicans were not allowed to vote, however. Twenty key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent. Grant was watchful; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power. On January 29, 1877, Grant signed the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission Act]] that gave a 15-member bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes. The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes; Tilden received 184. Grant's personal honesty, firmness, and even-handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=596\u2013605}}<ref>Paul Leland Haworth, ''The Hayes-Tilden disputed presidential election of 1876'' (1906).

Grant administration}}\n\nGrant's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption. An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office. In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for [[African American]] civil rights. Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise. He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies, signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington, settling the [[Alabama Claims]] issue with Britain through [[International Arbitration|arbitration]]. Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie, but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873\u20131877.<ref>C-SPAN 2009 Historians Presidential Leadership Survey</ref> Grant, wary of powerful congressional leaders, was the first president to ask for a [[line item veto|line item]] veto\u2014though Congress never allowed one.<ref>Weisburger, ''The Item And \"fight 'em\" Veto'', ''American Heritage'' (November, 1995),</ref>\n\nHis presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates. [[Nepotism]], practiced by Grant, was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment.<ref name=\"Lawrence M. Salinger 2005 374\u2013375\"/> It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly [[American Civil War]], rapid industrialization, and Westward expansionism.<ref name=\"Woodward 1957\">Woodward 1957.</ref> His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while president and afterward. Despite the scandals, by the end of Grant's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior (1875), Treasury (1874), and Justice (1875) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members.<ref>Nevins 1957, p. 833.</ref>\n\nGrant's generous treatment of [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox]] helped give him popularity in the South. Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda, the Republican party at the end of Grant's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies. His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party, which lost heavily in 1874. Grant's financial policies favored Wall Street, but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with.<ref>Simon 1997, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref> Revisionist historians during the first half of the twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the [[Lost Cause]] at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant's presidency as a corrupt despot.<ref name=\"Skidmorepp150\u2014151\">Skidmore, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\nThe 20th-century historical views of Grant were less favorable. Political analyst [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] noted in 1998 that, \"Ulysses S. Grant is universally ranked among the greatest American generals, and his Memoirs are widely considered to belong with the best military autobiographies ever written. But he is inevitably named, by conservatives as well as liberals, as one of the worst presidents in American history.\"<ref name=Better>Michael Barone, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/grant-and-the-historians/article/10329 \"A Better President Than They Think\"], ''The Weekly Standard'' (August 3, 1998).</ref> Barone argues that: \"This consensus, however, is being challenged by writers outside the professional historians' guild.\" Barone points to a lawyer [[Frank Scaturro]], who led the movement to restore [[Grant's Tomb]] while only a college student, and in 1998 wrote the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant's presidency in a positive light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scaturro|first=Frank|title=President Grant Reconsidered|year=1998|publisher=Madison Books|location=Lanham|isbn=1-56833-132-0}}</ref> Barone said that Scaturro's work was a \"convincing case that Grant was a strong and, in many important respects, successful president. It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history&nbsp;... Scaturro's work&nbsp;... should prompt a reassessment of the entire Progressive-New Deal Tradition.\"<ref name=Better/>\n\nIn the 21st Century, Grant's reputation and ranking had significantly increased, that followed a series of positive biographies written by noted historians, that included [[Jean Edward Smith]], ''Grant'',{{sfn|Smith|2001}} [[H.W. Brands]], ''The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace''<ref name=\"Ulysses Grant in War and Peace\">{{cite book|last=Brands|first=H.W.|title=The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace|year=2013|publisher=Anchor|isbn=978-0307475152}}</ref> and most recently [[Ronald C.

Grant''' began on March 4, 1869, when [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|18th]] [[president of the United States]], and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and he presided over much of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] became president after defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Horatio Seymour]] in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. He was reelected in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] in a [[landslide victory]], overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], which nominated [[Horace Greeley]] to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] after the contested [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].\n\nReconstruction took precedence during Grant's two terms of office. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] caused widespread violence throughout the South against African Americans. By 1870, all former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states had been readmitted into the United States and were represented in Congress. However Democrats, or former slave owners, violently refused to accept that freedmen were citizens, who were granted suffrage by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. By 1871 Klan activity was becoming out of control, while Grant and Congress created the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and had passed three [[Force Acts]]. Grant and his Attorney General [[Amos T. Akerman]] began a crackdown on Klan in the South, starting in South Carolina, making arrests and convictions, causing the Klan to demobilize and ensuring a fair election for 1872. Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers, Grant was self-reliant in choosing his [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]]. He relied heavily on former Army associates, who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics. Numerous scandals plagued his administration, including allegations of bribery, fraud, and cronyism. In 1872, Grant signed into law an [[Act of Congress]] that established [[Yellowstone National Park]], the nation's first National Park.\n\nA strong economy, reduction of the national debt, federal spending, tariffs, and the federal workforce, aided Grant in getting reelected. Congress established a de facto deflationary [[gold standard]] that reduced the number of [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]] in the national economy.\nHowever, financial overinvestment in railroad construction, caused the [[Panic of 1873]], and economic turmoil. The [[Long Depression]] that followed, and Grant's veto of an inflation bill, turned public opinion against him. Democrats regained control of the House in the [[United States elections, 1874|1874 elections]]. While scandals escalated, reformers appointed by Grant were able to clean up some federal departments. Most notably, Secretary of the Treasury [[Benjamin Bristow]] prosecuted the [[Whiskey Ring]], leading to the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, [[Orville E. Babcock]].  Grant continued to support Reconstruction, and he signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which banned discrimination in [[public accommodations]]. Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] suddenly resigned office in February 1876; afterwards impeached by the House for taking kickbacks. When Grant left office in 1877, [[Redeemers]] in the South, controlled all state governments.\n\nThe United States was at peace with the world throughout Grant's eight years in office, but his handling of foreign policy was uneven. Tensions with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the West continued. Under the talented Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]], the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] restored relations with Britain and resolved the contentious [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]], while the [[Virginius Affair|''Virginius'' Affair]] with [[Spain]] was settled peacefully. Grant attempted to [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annex]] the Caribbean island of [[Santo Domingo]], but the annexation was blocked by the Senate.\n\nWith the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans. Grant pursued a ''Peace'' policy with Native Americans, but persistent western expansion by settlers made conflict difficult to avoid. Grant presided over the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] and other clashes with the Native Americans. Grant's presidency was traditionally denounced by historians due to corruption charges among subordinates, despite efforts of reform in his administration. His presidential reputation has greatly risen over the past few decades among historians who have noted that Grant advanced a modern presidency, that included a reformed Indian policy, [[African American]] civil rights, the first Civil Service Commission, and protected women under federal law.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Election of 1868==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1868}}\n[[File:Grant-Colfax.png|right|thumb|250px|Grant-Colfax Campaign Poster 1868]]\nGrant's rise in political popularity among Republicans was based on his Union military service during the Civil War, his successful generalship that defeated [[Robert E.

On March 9, 1869, the House repealed the law outright, but the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill and only offered Grant a temporary suspension of the law. When Grant objected, the Senate Republican caucus met, and proposed allowing the President to have a free hand in choosing and removing his own cabinet.

Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the early 1870s. Grant appointed [[Hiram C. Whitley]] as director of the new Secret Service Agency in 1869, after he had successfully arrested 12 Klansmen in Georgia who would murdered a leading local Republican official. Whitley used talented detectives who infiltrated and broke up KKK units in North Carolina and Alabama. However they could not penetrate the main hotbed of KKK activity in upstate South Carolina. Grant sent in Army troops but Whitley's agents learned they were lying below until the troops were withdrawn. Whitley warned Akerman, who convinced Grant to declare martial law and send in US marshals backed by federal troops to arrest 500 Klansmen; hundred more fled the state, and hundreds of others surrendered in return for leniency.<ref>Charles Lane, ''Freedom's Detective: The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror'' (2019) pp 181-84.</ref><ref>Jerry West, ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865-1877'' (2002).</ref>\n\nIn the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in [[Albany, New York]]. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South.

This law was designed to keep the [[Redeemers]] from attacking or threatening African Americans. This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.{{sfn|Scaturro|2006}}\n\nOn January 13, 1871, Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the South.

Congress responded and on July 15, 1870, Grant signed the Indian Appropriations Act into law that appropriated the tribal monies. Two days after Spotted Tail urged the Grant administration to keep white settlers from invading Native reservation land, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \"keep intruders off by military force if necessary\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=270-272}} In 1871, Grant signed another Indians Appropriations Act that ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations.

In 1872, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the [[Methodists]] received fourteen; the Orthodox [[Quakers|Friends]] ten; the [[Presbyterians]] nine; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] eight; the [[Roman Catholics]] seven; the Hicksite [[Quakers|Friends]] six; the [[Baptists]] five; the [[Dutch Reformed]] five; the [[Congregationalists]] three; [[Christians]] two; [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and [[Lutherans]] one.

Walker.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=273}}\n\n===Financial affairs===\nOn taking office Grant's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit, which the Republican Congress had just passed. It ensured that all public debts, particularly war bonds, would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks. The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=480\u201381}}\n\nOn May 19, 1869, Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government. In 1868, a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours; however, much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced. To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \"no reduction shall be made in the wages\" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers.<ref>Grant (1869), ''Respecting Wages of labor'', Executive Order</ref>\n\nTreasury Secretary [[George S. Boutwell]] reorganized and reformed the [[United States Treasury]] by discharging unnecessary employees, started sweeping changes in [[Bureau of Printing and Engraving]] to protect the currency from [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiters]], and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue. These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2001}} By May 1869, Boutwell reduced the national debt by $12&nbsp;million. By September the national debt was reduced by $50&nbsp;million, which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for [[United States Note|greenbacks]] and buying back wartime bonds with the currency. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the Grant administration's debt policy.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\nThe first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $292&nbsp;million in 1871 \u2013 down from $322&nbsp;million in 1869. The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11% in 1871. Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1, 1869, to 3,804 on December 1, 1871. He had increased tax revenues by $108&nbsp;million from 1869 to 1872.

In 1870, Pleasonton, a Grant appointment, approved an unauthorized $60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm. Treasury Secretary [[George Boutwell]] promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office. Refusing to resign on Boutwell's request, Pleasonton protested openly before Congress. Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out.<ref>Boutwell 2008, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Further|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1861\u20131897}}\n\nGrant was a man of peace, and almost wholly devoted to domestic affairs. There were no foreign-policy disasters, and no wars to engage in. Besides Grant himself, the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[Charles Sumner]]. They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified. When Sumner stopped Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo, Grant had his vengeance by systematically destroying Sumner's power and ending his career. Historians have a high regard for the diplomatic professionalism, independence, and good judgment of Hamilton Fish. The main issues involved Britain, Canada, Santo Domingo, Cuba and Spain.  Worldwide, it was peaceful era, with no major wars directly affecting the United States. In Europe, [[Otto von Bismarck]] was leading Prussia into a dominant position in the new united German Empire. After short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France ended in 1871, Bismarck was the dominant figure in Europe, and worked tirelessly and successfully to promote a peaceful continent until his removal in 1890.<ref>The main scholarly history remains [[Allan Nevins]], ''Hamilton Fish: The inner history of the Grant administration'' (two volumes 1937) 932 PP, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. the most recent scholarly survey is Charles W Calhoun, ''The Presidency of Ulysses S.

Previously in 1868, President [[Andrew Johnson]] had proposed annexation but Congress refused.  In July 1869 Grant sent [[Orville E. Babcock]] and [[Rufus Ingalls]] who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic president [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for $2&nbsp;million. To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5&nbsp;million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of [[Santo Domingo]] as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870, the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not building support in Congress or the country at large. {{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=499\u2013502}}{{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}}<ref>Harold T.

By providing a safe haven for the freedmen, he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights. Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit. He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would push Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and  Puerto Rico, and perhaps Brazil as well. {{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}} On March 15, 1870, the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]], headed by Sen.

The speech angered the British government, and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down.

A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871, in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers.

Between 1872 in 1874, the buffalo herd south of the Platte River yielded 4.4 million kills by white hunters, and about 1 million animals killed by Indians.<ref>Richard White, ''The Republic for which it Stands'' (2017) p 296.</ref>  Popular concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegally for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adopt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\"/> Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to open pasture land for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=536\u201338}}\n\n===Corruption and reform===\n{{main|Ulysses S.

The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold, thus driving its price. Grant and Secretary of Treasury [[George S. Boutwell]] found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4&nbsp;million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=481\u201390}}\n\n====Civil service commission and reform====\nThe reform of the spoils system of political patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant presidency, that would take on the fervor of a religious revival.{{sfn|White|2017|p=531}} The distribution of federal jobs by Congressional legislators was considered vital for their reelection to Congress.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Grant required that all applicants to federal jobs apply directly to the Department heads, rather than the president.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Two of Grant's appointments, Secretary of Interior [[Jacob D. Cox]] and Secretary of Treasury [[George S. Boutwell]] put in place examinations in their respected departments advocated by reformers.{{sfn|White|2016|p=531}}  Grant and all reformed agreed that the prevailing system of appointments was unsound, for it maximized party advantage and minimized efficiency and the nonpartisan interest of good government. Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure.<ref>John Y. Simon, \"Ulysses S. Grant and Civil Service Reform,\" ''Hayes Historical Journal'' (1984) 4#3 pp 8\u201315.</ref>\n\nGrant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first [[United States Civil Service Commission]]. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. [[Chester A. Arthur]] who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions.<ref>Howe (1935), p. 48, 295</ref> However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether ''patronage'', meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labeled corruption.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=587\u201389}}\n\nThe movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives: to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy and to check the power of President Johnson. Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress, he refused, saying: \n{{Quote|Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress. If members will give up claiming patronage, that will be a step gained.

These were known as [[Star routes|Star Routes]] because an asterisk was given on official [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] documents. These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while [[John Creswell]], Grant's 1869 appointment, was [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was [[Censure in the United States|censured]] by the minority House report. A $40,000 bribe to the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]] by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation. In 1876, another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years.<ref>Grossman 2003, pp. 308\u2013309.</ref>\n\n====New York Custom House Ring====\n[[File:That salary grab-\"You took it\" LCCN93500053.tif|thumb|180px|\"Salary Grab\" caption: \"That salary grab \u2013 'You took it'\" ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'' December 27, 1873]] \nPrior to the presidential election of 1872 two congressional and one Treasury Department investigations took place over corruption at the New York Custom House under Grant collector appointments [[Moses H.

Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for the previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and the bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong statement for good government.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=553}}<ref>Jeffery A. Jenkins, et al. \"Who Should Govern Congress?

When Republicans gathered for their [[1872 Republican National Convention|1872 national convention]] he was unanimously nominated for a second term. [[Henry Wilson]] was selected as his running mate over scandal-tainted Vice President Schuyler Colfax. The party platform advocated high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states.\n\nDuring Grant's first term a significant number of Republicans had become completely disillusioned with the party. Weary of the scandals and opposed to several of Grant's policies, split from the party to form the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]. At the party's only national convention, held in May 1872 ''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor Horace Greeley was nominated for president, and [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] was nominated for vice president. They advocated civil service reform, a low tariff, and granting amnesty to former Confederate soldiers. They also wanted to end reconstruction and restore local self-government in the South.\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1872.svg|thumb|left|Electoral Vote Results 1872]]\n\nThe Democrats, who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own, saw an opportunity to consolidate the anti-Grant vote and jumped on the Greeley bandwagon, reluctantly adopting Greeley and Brown as their nominees.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\">Rhodes 1906, [https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst05rhodgoog <!-- quote=intitle:History intitle:of intitle:the intitle:United intitle:States inauthor:Rhodes inauthor:James. --> v. 7].</ref> It is the only time in American history when a major party endorsed the candidate of a third party.\n\nWhile Grant, like incumbent presidents before him, did not campaign, an efficient party organization composed of thousands of patronage appointees, did so on his behalf. [[Frederick Douglass]] supported Grant and reminded black voters that Grant had destroyed the violent [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=550}}<ref>Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', pp. 308, 309</ref> Greeley embarked on a five-state campaign tour in late September, during which he delivered nearly 200 speeches. His campaign was plagued by misstatements and embarrassing moments.\n\nHowever, because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley was no match for Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes and received 55.8 percent of the popular vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both houses of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard-fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\" />\n\n==Second term 1873\u20131877==\n[[File:Grant-Chase-1873.jpg|thumb|Grant's second inauguration as president by Chief Justice [[Salmon P.

Subsequently, the inaugural ball ended early when the food froze. Wilson died 2 years, 263 days into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. Departing from the White House, a parade escorted Grant down the newly paved Pennsylvania Avenue, which was all decorated with banners and flags, on to the swearing-in ceremony in front of the Capitol building. Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] administered the presidential oath of office. This was one of the coldest inaugurations in U.S. history, with the temperature at only 6 degrees at sunrise. After the swearing-in ceremony the inaugural parade commenced down Pennsylvania. The [[The Washington Star|''Evening Star'']] observed. \"The private stands and windows along the entire route were crowded to excess.\" The parade consisted of a variety of military units along with marching bands, and civic organizations. The military units, in their fancy regalia, were the most noticeable. Altogether there were approximately 12,000 marchers who participated, including several units of African-American soldiers. At the inaugural ball there were some 6,000 people in attendance. Great care was taken to ensure that Grant's inaugural ball would be in spacious quarters and would feature an elegant assortment of appetizers, food, and champagne. A large temporary wooden building was constructed at Judiciary Square to accommodate the event. Grant arrived around 11:30pm and the dancing began.<ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp. 471\u2013473</ref>{{sfn|Streets of Washington|2017}}<ref>[[#ames|Ames, 1879]], pp. 272, 276</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\nGrant was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 24\u201325}} He proactively used military and [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other 19th-century president. He used his full powers to weaken the [[Ku Klux Klan]], reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed [[James Milton Turner]] as the first African American minister to a foreign nation.<ref name=\"Kremer\"/> Grant's relationship with [[Charles Sumner]], the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.<ref>David Herbert Donald, ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'' (1970) ch 12</ref>\n\nConservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections. With the destruction of the Klan in 1872, new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South. In Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana, the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]] operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan. Their goals were to oust the Republicans, return Conservative whites to power, and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them. Being loyal to his veterans, Grant remained determined that African Americans would receive protection.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 25}}\n\nPolygamy, Chinese prostitution, support of Jewish people, and secular education were also issues during Reconstruction.\n\n====Colfax Massacre====\n{{main|Colfax Massacre}}\nAfter the November 4, 1872, election, [[Louisiana]] was a split state. In a controversial election, two candidates were claiming victory as governor. Violence was used to intimidate black Republicans. The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed [[John McEnery (Louisiana)|John McEnery]] as the victor, while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator [[William P. Kellogg]]. Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13, 1873. A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated. The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office. Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg. On March 4, Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg's state militia defeated McEnry's fusionist party's insurrection.<ref>Keith 2007, p. 100.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Union as It Was.jpg|thumb|150px|Louisiana White League units in 1874 to terrorized black Republicans]]\nA dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] courthouse in [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]]. Kellogg's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops. Then on April 13, White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured. A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg. On April 21, Grant sent in the U.S. [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] to restore order. On May 22, Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana. On May 31, McEnry finally told his followers to obey \"peremptory orders\" of the President. The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana, except, ironically, [[Grant Parish]].<ref>Lane 2008, p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas====\n{{main|Brooks\u2013Baxter War}}\nIn the fall of 1872, the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor, [[Elisha Baxter]] and [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]]. Massive fraud characterized the election, but Baxter was declared the winner and took office. Brooks never gave up; finally, in 1874, a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in. Both sides mobilized militia units, and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets. Speculation swirled as to who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks. Grant delayed, requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor, but Baxter refused to participate. On May 15, 1874, Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas, and hostilities ceased.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Johnson (1908), pp. 122\u2013168.</ref><ref>Woodward 1971, pp. 315\u2013336.</ref> In the fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter, and Republicans and the [[Redeemers]] came to power.\n\nA few months later in early 1875, Grant announced that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872. Grant did not send in troops, and Brooks never regained office. Instead, Grant appointed him to the high-paying patronage job of US postmaster in Little Rock.  Grant's legalistic approach Did resolve the conflict peacefully, but it left the Republican Party in Arkansas in total disarray, and further discredited grants reputation.<ref>Charles W.

They promised to lower city spending and taxes. Despite such intentions, the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government, which had a majority of African Americans. The White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby, the black [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]] Sheriff and tax collector. Crosby sought help from Republican Governor [[Adelbert Ames]] to regain his position as sheriff. Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position. At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443, more than half of whom were African American.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\">Rhodes (1906), v. 7, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1874, Crosby and an African-American militia approached Vicksburg. He had said that the Whites were, \"ruffians, barbarians, and political [[banditti]]\".<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" /> A series of confrontations occurred against white paramilitary forces that resulted in the deaths of 29 African Americans and 2 Whites. The White militia retained control of the County Court House and jail.\n\nOn December 21, Grant issued a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting. General [[Philip Sheridan]], based in Louisiana for this regional territory, dispatched federal troops, who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace. When questioned about the matter, Governor Ames denied that he had told Crosby to use African-American militia. On June 7, 1875, Crosby was shot to death by a white deputy while drinking in a bar. The origins of the shooting remained a mystery.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" />\n[[File:JamesLongstreet.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate General [[James Longstreet|James A.

Longstreet]], with 3,000 [[African American]] militia and 400 Metropolitan police, made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops. Consisting of former Confederate soldiers, the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet's army. On September 17, Grant sent in Federal troops, and they restored the government back to Kellogg. During the following controversial election in November, passions rose high, and violence mixed with fraud were rampant; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control. The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\">Hutton 2009, pp. 262\u2013266.</ref><ref>Zuczek 2006, p. 413.</ref>\n\nGrant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent [[Phil Sheridan]] in to keep law and order in the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4, 1875, legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel [[R\u00e9gis de Trobriand]], and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. Trobriand returned to the Statehouse and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\"/>\n\n====South Carolina 1876====\n{{further|South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876}}\n\n[[File:Wade Hampton III - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate officer [[Wade Hampton III]] was supported by the terrorist group [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in the 1876 Governor's election in South Carolina.]]\nDuring the election year of 1876, South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel H.

The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term. Hampton supporters, donning red shirts, disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling. Tensions became violent on July 8, 1876, when five African Americans were murdered at [[Hamburg, South Carolina|Hamburg]]. The rifle clubs, wearing their [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], were better armed than the blacks. South Carolina was ruled more by \"mobocracy and bloodshed\" than by Chamberlain's government.<ref name=\"Zuczek 1996 159\u2013165,170\u2013172,174,176\">Zuczek 1996, pp. 159\u2013165, 170\u2013172, 174, 176.</ref>\n\nBlack militia fought back in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] on September 6, 1876, in what was known as the \"King Street riot\". The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside [[Ellenton, South Carolina|Ellenton]]. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \"rifle club\" members to put down their weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to Grant and asked for federal intervention. The \"Cainhoy riot\" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \"Brick Church\" outside [[Cainhoy]]. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877 after President [[Rutherford B.

The new law was designed to allow everyone access to public eating establishments, hotels, and places of entertainment. This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States. The bill was also passed in honor of Senator [[Charles Sumner]] who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872.<ref>''The New York Times'' 1875, pp. 1\u20132.</ref> In his sixth message to Congress, he summed up his own views, \"While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution&nbsp;... will be enforced with rigor&nbsp;...

He told Utah territorial governor, [[George W. Emery]], that he had been deceived concerning the Mormons.<ref name=\"ilovehistory.utah.gov\"/> However, on December 7, 1875, after his return to Washington, Grant wrote to Congress in his seventh annual State of the Union address that as \"an institution polygamy should be banished from the land\u2026\"<ref>[http://www.themoralliberal.com/2011/07/05/various-presidents-on-polygamy/ Various Presidents on Polygamy (July 05, 2011)]</ref>\nGrant believed that polygamy negatively affected children and women.

In his army days he traded at a local store operated by the Seligman brothers, two Jewish merchants who became Grant's lifelong friends. They [[J. & W.

Running for president in 1868 Grant publicly apologized for it.Once elected he set out to make amends.  He appointed several Jewish leaders to office, including [[Simon Wolf]] recorder of deeds in Washington D.C., and [[Edward S. Salomon]] Governor of the [[Washington Territory]].{{sfn|White|2016|pp=494\u2013495}}  Historian [[Jonathan Sarna]] argues:\n\n<blockquote>Eager to prove that he was above prejudice, Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania. Time and again, partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11, Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality.&nbsp;... Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.' During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews looked forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation.<ref>Sarna, ''When General Grant Expelled the Jews'' (2012), Introduction</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Native American affairs===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\nUnder Grant's ''Peace'' policy, wars between settlers, the federal army, and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the [[Dakota Territory]] and the completion of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], threatened to unravel Grant's Indian policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=538}}\n\nIn his second term of presidential office, Grant's fragile ''Peace'' policy came apart. Major General [[Edward Canby]] was killed in the [[Modoc War]]. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]] in 1876.{{sfn|Michno|2003|pp=295\u201396, 363}} Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=368}}\n\n====Modoc War====\n{{further|Modoc War}}\nIn January 1873, Grant's Native American peace policy was challenged. Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term, fighting broke out between the [[Modocs]] and settlers near the California-Oregon border. The Modocs, led by [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]], killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission. Sherman then sent Major General [[Edward Canby]], but Captain Jack killed him. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed. [[Alfred B. Meacham]], an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated. Grant overruled Sherman; Captain Jack was executed, and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the [[Quapaw Agency]] in the [[Indian Territory]]. This episode and the [[Great Sioux War]] undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian [[Robert M. Utley]].<ref>Utley 1984b, p. 206.</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=534\u201336}} During the peace negotiations between Brig. Gen. [[Edward Canby]] and the Modoc tribal leaders, there were more Indians in the tent then had been agreed upon. As the Indians grew more hostile, Captain Jack, said \"I talk no more.\" and shouted \"All ready.\" Captain Jack drew his revolver and fired directly into the head of Gen Canby. Brig. Gen Canby was the highest-ranking officer to be killed during the Indian Wars that took place from 1850 to 1890. Alfred Meacham, who survived the massacre, defended the Modocs who were put on trial.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=265}}\n\n====Red River War====\n{{main|Red River War}}\nIn 1874, war erupted on the southern Plains when [[Quanah Parker]], leader of the [[Comanche]], led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River, at [[Adobe Walls, Texas]]. The Army under General [[Phil Sheridan]] launched a military campaign, and, with few casualties on either side, forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies. Grant, who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals [[William T. Sherman]] and Phil Sheridan, imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida.<ref>Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 536\u2013538;</ref>\n\n====Great Sioux War====\n{{main|Great Sioux War|Battle of Little Big Horn}}\nIn 1874 gold had been discovered in the [[Black Hills]] in the [[Dakota Territory]]. White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the [[Sioux]] tribe by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] of 1868. In 1875, to avoid conflict Grant met with [[Red Cloud]], chief of the Sioux and offered $25,000 from the government to purchase the land. The offer was declined. On November 3, 1875 at a White House meeting, [[Phil Sheridan]] told the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers; Grant ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation. Sheridan used a strategy of convergence, using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation. On June 25, 1876, one of these columns, led by Colonel [[George A. Custer]] met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and part of his command was slaughtered. Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 Indians.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=296}} Custer's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation. Sheridan avenged Custer, pacified the northern Plains, and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=538\u201340}} On August 15, 1876, President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $1,000,000 in rations, while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills, except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103rd meridian. On August 28, a seven-man committee, appointed by Grant, gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance. [[Halfbreeds]] and \"squaw men\" (A white man with an Indian wife) were banished from the Sioux reservation. To receive the government rations, the Indians had to work the land. Reluctantly, on September 20, the Indian leaders, whose people were starving, agreed to the committee's demands and signed the agreement.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 260\u2013263</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary [[William W. Belknap]] (see below).{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=110\u2013111}} Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux.{{sfn|Donovan|2008|p=112}} Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]].{{sfn|Donovan|2008|p=115}} Two months after Custer's death Grant castigated him in the press, saying \"I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary \u2013 wholly unnecessary.\"{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=322\u2013323}} As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer, Grant's peace policy became militaristic; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops, two more forts were constructed, the army took over the Indian agencies and Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition.{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=321, 327}}\n\n===Financial affairs===\n\n====Panic of 1873====\n{{main|Panic of 1873}}\n[[file:The Great Financial Panic of 1873 - Closing the door of the Stock Exchange on its members, Saturday, Sept. 20th LCCN99614016.tif|right|150px|thumb|The ''NYSE'' closed on September 20, 1873]]\nBetween 1868 and 1873, the American economy was robust, primarily caused by railroad building, manufacturing expansion, and thriving agriculture production. Financial debt, however, particularly in railroad investment, spread throughout both the private and federal sectors. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=419}} The market began to break in July 1873 when the Brookyn Trust Company went broke and closed. Secretary Richardson sold gold to pay for $14 million in federal bonds.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=420}} Two months later, the [[Panic of 1873]], collapsed the national economy. On September 17, the stock market crashed, followed by the New York Warehouse & Security Company, September 18, and the [[Jay Cooke & Company]], September 19, both going bankrupt. On September 19, Grant ordered Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|Richardson]], Boutwell's replacement, to purchase $10 million in bonds. Richardson complied using greenbacks to expand the money supply. On September 20, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (''NYSE'') closed for ten days. Traveling to New York, Grant met with Richardson to consult with bankers, who gave Grant conflicting financial advice.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=421}}\n\nReturning to Washington, Grant and Richardson sent millions of greenbacks from the treasury to New York to purchase bonds, stopping the purchases on September 24. By the beginning of January 1874, Richardson had issued a total of $26 million greenbacks from the Treasury reserve, into the economy, relieving Wall Street, but not stopping the national [[Long Depression]], that would last 5 years. Thousands of businesses, depressed daily wages by 25% for three years, and brought the unemployment rate up to 14%.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=575\u201382|Chernow|2017|2pp=419-420|McFeely|1981|3p=394}}{{sfn|Oberholzer|1922|loc=3:79\u2013122}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 8}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 9}}\n\n====Inflation bill vetoed and compromise====\n[[File:Grant Inflation Bill Veto.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon by Thomas Nast: Grant congratulated for vetoing the \"inflation bill\" on April 22, 1874]]\nGrant and Richardson's mildly inflationary response to the Panic of 1873, encouraged Congress to pursue a more aggressive policy. The legality of releasing greenbacks was presumed to have been illegal. On April 14, 1874, Congress passed the ''Inflation Bill'' that set the greenback maximum at $400,000 retroactively legalizing the $26 million reserve greenbacks earlier released by the Treasury. The bill released an additional $18 million in [[United States Note|greenbacks]] up to the original $400,000,000 amount. Going further, the bill authorized an additional $46 million in banknotes and raised their maximum to $400 million.  {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=441}} Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold. Most of Grant's cabinet favored the bill in order to secure a Republican election. Grant's conservative Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill. On April 22, 1874, after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill, Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] because he believed it would destroy the nation's credit.<ref>Rhodes 1906, ch. 7, pp. 126\u2013127; Nevins (1957), ''Hamilton Fish: The Inner History of the Grant Administration. Volume: 2'', pp. 706\u2013708 711\u2013714</ref>\n\nCongress passed a compromise bill, that Grant signed on June 20, 1874. The act legalized the $26 million released by Richardson, and set the maximum of greenbacks at $382 million. Up to $55 million in national banknotes would be redistributed from states with an excess to those states that had minimal amounts. The act did little to relieve the national economy. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=445-446}}\n\n====Resumption of Specie Act====\nOn January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act, and he could not have been happier; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act. The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]]. This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1, 1879. The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the number of greenbacks in circulation. At that time there were \"paper coin\" currency worth less than $1.00, and these would be exchanged for silver coins. Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \"good as gold\". In an age without a [[Federal Reserve]] system to control inflation, this act stabilized the economy. Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=581\u201382}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 11}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{further |Hamilton Fish}}\nHistorians credit Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] with a highly effective foreign policy.

After a hasty trial, the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents, eight of whom were United States citizens; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late. War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain, heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid, retired general [[Daniel Sickles]]. Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis, and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the ''Virginius'' ship had the right to bear the United States flag. The Spanish Republic's president [[Emilio Castelar]] expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration. Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe. With Grant's approval, Spain was to surrender ''Virginius'', pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed, and salute the American flag; the episode ended quietly.<ref>Bradford 1980.</ref>\n\n====Hawaiian free trade treaty====\nIn December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, [[David Kalakaua]], who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}} Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful [[free trade treaty]] in 1875 with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economy sphere.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}}\n\n====Liberian-Grebo war====\nThe U.S. settled the war between [[Liberia]] and the native [[Grebo people]] in 1876 by dispatching the {{USS|Alaska|1868|6}} to Liberia. [[James Milton Turner]], the first African American ambassador from the United States, requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia, a former American colony.

The Democratic Party held the Repubican Party responsible for the [[Long Depression]]. The Republicans were divided on the currency issue. Grant, who with hard money North Eastern Republicans, vetoed an inflation bill. Grant was blamed for the nation's problems, while he was accused of wanting a third term.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=462-463}} Grant never officially campaigned, but traveled West, to emphasize his relatively popular Indian policy.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}}\n\nThe October elections, swept the Republicans from office, and was a repudation of Grant's veto. {{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=783}} In Indiana and Ohio, the Republicans suffered losses, caused by a breakaway Republican [[temperance movement]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}} The Democratic Party won the New York governership to Democrat [[Samuel Tilden]].

Six Republican office holders were murdered in [[Coushatta, Louisiana]]. On September 14, General Longstreet, police, and black militia fought 3,500 White Leaguers who attempted to capture the statehouse in New Orleans, that ended with 32 people killed.  Grant issued a dispersal proclamation, the next day, and sent 5,000 troops and 5 gunboats to [[New Orleans]]. The [[White League]] resistance collapsed.

Grant presidential administration reforms|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals}}\nScandals and frauds continued to be exposed during Grant's second term in office, although Grant's appointments of reformers to his cabinet temporarily helped his presidential reputation, cleaned up federal departments, and defeated the notorious [[Whiskey Ring]]. Grant, however, often remained loyal to cabinet members or appointees involved in corruption or mismanagement, refusing to believe in their guilt. The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft. The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain, [[Robert C. Schenck]], using his name to promote a worked out silver mine. The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson; however, political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal.<ref name=\"Rives\">Rives 2000.</ref>\n\n====Sanborn contracts====\n{{further|Sanborn incident}}\n\nIn June 1874, Treasury Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|William A. Richardson]] gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions. The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], while Sanborn claimed these payments were \"expenses\". Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions, but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with.{{sfn|Hinsdale|1911|p=212\u201413}}\n\n====Pratt & Boyd====\nIn April 1875, it was discovered that Attorney General [[George Henry Williams|George H.

Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\n====Delano's Department of Interior ====\nBy 1875, the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior [[Columbus Delano]] was in serious disrepair with corruption and fraud. Profiteering prevailed in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents. This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant's Indian peace policy. Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow at the expense and exploitation of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Delano had allowed \"Indian Attorneys\" who were paid by Native American tribes $8.00 a day plus food and travel expenses for sham representation in Washington. Delano exempted his department from Grant's civil service reform implementation in federal offices. Delano told Grant the Interior Department was too large to implement civil service reform.\n\nDelano's son, John Delano, and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant, were discovered to have been awarded lucrative corrupt cartographical contracts by Surveyor General Silas Reed. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were qualified to hold such surveying positions.

Babcock]] was indicted and later acquitted in trial.<ref>Rhodes 1906, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0cMTAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA182&dq=Benjamin+Bristow#v=onepage&q=Benjamin%20Bristow&f=false p. 187].</ref> Grant's new Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]] and Bristow formed an anti-corruption team to weed out criminal activity during Grant's second term. The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States, and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association. The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments, 110 convictions, and $3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department. Bristow and Pierrpont brought evidence to Grant of Babcock's involvement. Grant asked Babcock with Bristow and Pierrepont in attendance at the White House about the evidence. Babcock gave Grant an explanation that the evidence did not concern the Ring, and Grant quietly accepted Babcock's words at face value. During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders, Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock. As a result, Babcock was acquitted. However, the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation. The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant's political opponents.{{sfn|McFeely|2002|pp=406\u201316}}<ref>Garland 1898, p. 438.</ref>\n\n====Trading post ring====\n{{main|Trader post scandal}}\n\nIn March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at [[Fort Sill]]. Belknap was allowed to resign by Grant and as a result, was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=593\u201396}} In late April 1876, Grant lashed out at Lieut. Col. [[George A. Custer]], after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant's brother Orville and Sec. Belknap.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President. However, Grant refused to see him three times. When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln, he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the [[Great Sioux War|Sioux Campaign]]; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]]. However, at Terry's insistence, Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 67\u201371</ref>\n\n====Cattellism====\nIn March 1876, Secretary of Navy [[George M. Robeson]] was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company, a grain supplier, in return for real estate, loans, and payment of debts.<ref>Kennedy 2001.</ref> The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $15&nbsp;million in naval construction appropriations.<ref>Muench 2006, p. 74.</ref> Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction, the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \"Cattellism\".{{sfn|McFeely |2002|p=432}}\n\n====Safe burglary conspiracy====\nIn September 1876, [[Orville E. Babcock]], Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings, was indicted in a safe [[burglary]] [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] case and trial. In April, corrupt building contractors in Washington, D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred. Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring. Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy, but later [[acquitted]] in the trial against the burglars. Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the [[Confidence trick|swindles]] by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with.<ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\">''The New York Times'' 1876</ref><ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\"/>\n\n===Election of 1876===\nIn the [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]], the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and the Democrats nominated reformer [[Samuel Tilden]]. Results were split. Tilden received 51% of the popular vote; Hayes 48%; many black Republicans were not allowed to vote, however. Twenty key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent. Grant was watchful; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power. On January 29, 1877, Grant signed the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission Act]] that gave a 15-member bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes. The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes; Tilden received 184. Grant's personal honesty, firmness, and even-handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=596\u2013605}}<ref>Paul Leland Haworth, ''The Hayes-Tilden disputed presidential election of 1876'' (1906).

Grant administration}}\n\nGrant's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption. An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office. In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for [[African American]] civil rights. Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise. He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies, signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington, settling the [[Alabama Claims]] issue with Britain through [[International Arbitration|arbitration]]. Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie, but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873\u20131877.<ref>C-SPAN 2009 Historians Presidential Leadership Survey</ref> Grant, wary of powerful congressional leaders, was the first president to ask for a [[line item veto|line item]] veto\u2014though Congress never allowed one.<ref>Weisburger, ''The Item And \"fight 'em\" Veto'', ''American Heritage'' (November, 1995),</ref>\n\nHis presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates. [[Nepotism]], practiced by Grant, was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment.<ref name=\"Lawrence M. Salinger 2005 374\u2013375\"/> It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly [[American Civil War]], rapid industrialization, and Westward expansionism.<ref name=\"Woodward 1957\">Woodward 1957.</ref> His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while president and afterward. Despite the scandals, by the end of Grant's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior (1875), Treasury (1874), and Justice (1875) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members.<ref>Nevins 1957, p. 833.</ref>\n\nGrant's generous treatment of [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox]] helped give him popularity in the South. Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda, the Republican party at the end of Grant's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies. His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party, which lost heavily in 1874. Grant's financial policies favored Wall Street, but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with.<ref>Simon 1997, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref> Revisionist historians during the first half of the twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the [[Lost Cause]] at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant's presidency as a corrupt despot.<ref name=\"Skidmorepp150\u2014151\">Skidmore, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\nThe 20th-century historical views of Grant were less favorable. Political analyst [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] noted in 1998 that, \"Ulysses S. Grant is universally ranked among the greatest American generals, and his Memoirs are widely considered to belong with the best military autobiographies ever written. But he is inevitably named, by conservatives as well as liberals, as one of the worst presidents in American history.\"<ref name=Better>Michael Barone, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/grant-and-the-historians/article/10329 \"A Better President Than They Think\"], ''The Weekly Standard'' (August 3, 1998)].</ref> Barone argues that: \"This consensus, however, is being challenged by writers outside the professional historians' guild.\" Barone points to a lawyer [[Frank Scaturro]], who led the movement to restore [[Grant's Tomb]] while only a college student, and in 1998 wrote the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant's presidency in a positive light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scaturro|first=Frank|title=President Grant Reconsidered|year=1998|publisher=Madison Books|location=Lanham|isbn=1-56833-132-0}}</ref> Barone said that Scaturro's work was a \"convincing case that Grant was a strong and, in many important respects, successful president. It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history&nbsp;... Scaturro's work&nbsp;... should prompt a reassessment of the entire Progressive-New Deal Tradition.\"<ref name=Better/>\n\nIn the 21st Century, Grant's reputation and ranking had significantly increased, that followed a series of positive biographies written by noted historians, that included [[Jean Edward Smith]], ''Grant'',{{sfn|Smith|2001}} [[H.W. Brands]], ''The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace''<ref name=\"Ulysses Grant in War and Peace\">{{cite book|last=Brands|first=H.W.|title=The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace|year=2013|publisher=Anchor|isbn=978-0307475152}}</ref> and most recently [[Ronald C.
