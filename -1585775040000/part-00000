The most obvious is the similarity of the letters '''I''', '''O''' and '''Q''' to the numbers '''1''' and '''0'''. Therefore, depending on the [[Record locator|application]], various [[subset]]s of the alphanumeric were adopted to avoid misinterpretation by humans.\n\nIn passenger aircraft, [[aircraft seat map]]s and seats were designated by row number followed by column letter. For wide bodied jets, the seats can be 10 across, labeled '''ABC-DEFG-HJK'''. The letter '''I''' is skipped to avoid mistaking it as row number '''1'''.\n\nIn [[Vehicle Identification Number]] used by motor vehicle manufacturers, the letters '''I''', '''O''' and '''Q''' are omitted for their similarity to '''1''' or '''0'''.\n\nTiny embossed letters are used to label pins on an V.35/M34 electrical connector. The letters '''I''', '''O''', '''Q''', '''S''' and '''Z''' were dropped to ease eye strain with '''1''', '''0''', '''5''', '''3''',and '''2'''. That subset is named the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] Alphabet after the company that first used it.\n\nFor alphanumerics that are frequently handwritten, in addition to '''I''' and '''O''', '''V''' is avoided because it looks  like '''U''' in cursive, and '''Z''' for its similarity to '''2'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alphanumeric brand names]]\n* [[Alphanumeric brand names|Alphanumeric brands]]\n* [[Alphanumeric code]]\n* [[Alphanumeric keyboard]]\n* [[Binary-to-text encoding]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n", "name_user": "RayScript", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add source for human misinterpretation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric"}
