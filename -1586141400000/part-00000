They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in [[Udbodhan]] magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref> It created interest among intellectual circles, especially in the circles of Ramakrishna followers.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.124</ref>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.135</ref> The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math.After the inaugural of the Sri Sarada Math,Swami the Belur Math authorities instructed that monks would no longer visit it without proper reason or prior permission.<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.134</ref>\n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women's Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019.

Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created.<ref>Pravrajika Atmaprana, Monasticism for Indian Women, Monasticism Ideal and Traditions (Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai: Chennai1991), p.303</ref>\n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women.

This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion.\n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission's main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya).

Miss Glen who was here to visit the Holy Mother... also had a talk with Mother about it, and is very sanguine about the work.'<ref>A Blessed Life, Biography of Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Pravrajika Jnanadaprana, Sri Saradaa Math: Dakshineswar, 2012), p.126</ref>\n\n== Activities ==\n6 November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition.

This earliest Persian Empire had a profound impact upon local population as the religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] became ascendant as did various early Persian cultural influences. Many of the local peoples of Caucasian Albania came to be known as fire worshippers, which may be a sign of their Zoroastrian faith.\n\nThis empire lasted over 250 years and was conquered later by [[Alexander the Great]] and led to the rise of [[Hellenistic]] culture throughout the former Persian Empire. The [[Seleucid]] Greeks inherited the Caucasus following Alexander's death in 323 BCE, but were ultimately beset by pressures from Rome, secessionist Greeks in [[Bactria]], and most adversely the Parthians (''[[Parni]]''), another nomadic Iranian tribe from Central Asia, which made serious inroads into the northern eastern Seleucid domains from the late 4th century BCE to the 3rd century BCE and this ultimately allowed local Caucasian tribes to establish an independent kingdom for the first time since the Median invasion.\n\n===Caucasian Albania, the Parthians, and the Sassanian conquest===\n{{Main|Caucasian Albania|Parthian Empire|Roman-Parthian Wars|Sassanian Empire}}\n[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|right|Roman inscription in [[Qobustan, Absheron|Qobustan]]]]\n[[File:Mis qab, X\u0131n\u0131sl\u0131.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sassanid]] silver plate excavated in [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]], ([[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]])]]\n\nThe Albanian kingdom coalesced around a native Caucasian identity to forge a unique state in a region of vast empire-states. However, in the 2nd or 1st century BCE the Armenians considerably curtailed the Albanian territories to the south and conquered the territories of Karabakh and Utik, populated by various Albanian tribes, such as [[Udi people|Utians]], Gargarians and [[Caspians]].<ref>Hewsen, Robert H., Ethno-History and the Armenian Influence upon the Caucasian Albanians, in: Samuelian, Thomas J.

However at the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] Turkic tribes emanating from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the [[Ghaznavids]] from northern [[Afghanistan]], who took over part of Azerbaijan by 1030. They were followed by the Seljuqs, a western branch of the Oghuz who conquered all of Iran and the Caucasus and pressed on to Iraq where they overthrew the Buyids in Baghdad in 1055.\n\nThe Seljuqs became the main rulers of a vast empire that included all of Iran and Azerbaijan until the end of the 12th century. During the Seljuq period, the influential vizier of the Seljuq sultans, [[Nizam ul-Mulk]] (a noted Persian scholar and administrator) is noted for having helped introduce numerous educational and bureaucratic reforms. His death in 1092 marked the beginning of the decline of the once well-organized Seljuq state that further deteriorated following the death of Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] in 1153.\n\nLocally, Seljuq possessions were ruled by [[Atabegs]], who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans, but sometimes became de facto rulers themselves. The title of ''Atabeg'' was common during the Seljuq rule of the Middle East starting in the 12th century. Under their rule from the end of 12th to early 13th centuries, Azerbaijan emerged as an important cultural centre of the Turkic people. Palaces of the Atabeg ''Eldegizids'' (eldeniz) and the ''Shirvanshahs'' hosted distinguished people of the time, many of whom were outstanding Muslim artisans and scientists. The most famous of the Atabeg rulers was [[Ildeniz|Shams al-din Eldeqiz]] (Eldeniz).\n\nUnder the Seljuqs, great progress was achieved in different sciences and philosophy by Iranians like [[Bahmanyar]], Khatib Tabrizi, [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and others. Persian poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani Shirvani]], who lived in this region, epitomise the highest point in refined medieval Persian literature. In addition, the region experience a building boom and the unique of architecture of the Seljuq period is epitomized by the fortress walls, mosques, schools, mausoleums, and bridges of Baku, Ganja and Absheron which were built during the 12th century.\n\nIn 1225, [[Mingburnu|Jalaleddin Kharazmshah]] of [[Khwarezmid Empire]] put an end to the Atabeg rule.\n\n===Mongols and Ilkhanid rule===\n{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}\nThe Mongol invasion of the Middle East and Caucasus was a devastating event for Azerbaijan and most of its neighbors. From 1220, Begin beg began to pay tributes to the Mongols. [[Jebe]] and [[Subotai]] made the small state neutral. In 1231, the [[Mongols]] occupied most of Azerbaijan and killed the [[Khorezmshah]] [[Mingburnu|Jalaladdin]], who had overthrown the Atabeg dynasty. In 1235 the Mongols destroyed cities of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[\u015e\u0259mkir|Shamkir]], [[Tovuz, Azerbaijan|Tovuz]], [[Shabran Rayon|Shabran]] on their way to conquer [[Kievan Russia]]. By the 1236, all of Transcaucasia was in the hands of [[Ogedei khan]].\n\n=== The end of Mongol rule and the Kara Koyunlu-Agh Koyunlu rivalry ===\n{{main|Ak Koyunlu|Kara Koyunlu}}\n[[File:M\u00f6m\u00fcn\u0259xatun t\u00fcrb\u0259si 2018.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] in [[Nakhchivan City]]]]\n\n[[Tamerlane]] (Amir Timur) launched a devastating invasion of Azerbaijan in the 1380s, and temporarily incorporated Azerbaijan into his vast domain that spanned much of Eurasia. The [[Shirvanshah]] state under [[Shirvanshah Ibrahim I]] were also vassals of [[Timur]] and assisted Timur in his war with the Mongol ruler [[Tokhtamysh]] of the [[Golden Horde]]. Azerbaijan experienced social unrest and religious strife during this period due to sectarian conflict initiated by [[Hurufism|Hurufi]], [[Bektashi]] and other movements.\n\nFollowing Timur's death in 1405, his fourth son [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah-Rukh]] came to power and reigned until 1446. To the west of Shah-Rukh's domain two new rival Turkic states emerged \u2013 the ''[[Kara Koyunlu]]'' based around Lake Van and the [[Ak Koyunlu]] (or ''White Sheep Turks'') centred around Diyarbak\u0131r. Initially, it was the Kara Koyunlu who were ascendant when their chief [[Kara Yusuf]] overcame [[Sultan Ahmad]], the last of Jalayirids, and conquered lands south of Azerbaijan in 1410, establishing his capital at Tabriz. Under [[Jihan Shah|Jahan-Shah]], the Kara Koyunlu expanded their territory into central Iran and as far east as Khurasan. Later, however, the Ak Koyunlu came into greater prominence under [[Uzun Hasan]], overcoming [[Jihan Shah|Jahan-Shah]] and the Qara Qoyunlu in 1468. [[Uzun Hasan]] ruled all of Iran, Azerbaijan and Iraq until his death in 1478. Both Ak Koyunlu and Kara Koyunlu, continued the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] tradition of generous patrons of literature, poetry and the arts as the renowned [[Persian miniature|Islamic miniature]] paintings of Tabriz illustrate.\n\n=== The Shirvanshahs ===\n[[File:Baku ShirvanshahsBurialVault 004 1365.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Turbe (mausoleum) of Shirvanshahs in Baku, 15th century]]\n{{Main|Shirvanshahs}}\n\nSh\u012brw\u0101n Sh\u0101h<ref name=\"EIB\">Barthold, W., C.E.

The Shirvanshahs maintained a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539, and provided a continuity that lasted longer than any other dynasty in the Islamic world. There are two periods of an independent Shirvan state: first in the 12th century, under Sultans Manuchehr and Axsitan who built the stronghold of [[Baku]], and second in the 15th century under the [[House of Derbent|Derbendid]] dynasty. Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the Shirvanshahs were vassals of the Mongol and Timurid empires.\n\nThe [[Shirvanshahs]] [[Khalilullah I]] and [[Farrukh Yassar]] presided over a highly stable period in the history of the dynasty. The architectural complex of the \"Shirvanshah palace\" in Baku (that was also a burial site of the dynasty) and the [[Halwatiyya]] Sufi Khaneqa were built during the reign of these two rulers in the mid-15th century. The Shirvanshah rulers were more or less Orthodox [[Sunni]], and thus opposed the heterodox [[Shi'a Islam]] of the [[Safavid]] [[Sufi]] order. In 1462 [[Shaykh Junayd]], the leader of Safavids was killed in battle against [[Shirvanishans]], near the town of [[Gusar]] (he was buried in the village [[H\u0259zr\u0259, Qusar|Hazra]]) \u2013 an event that shaped subsequent Safavid actions leading to a new phase in the history of Azerbaijan.\n\n== Safavids and the rise of Shi'a Islam ==\n{{Main|Safavids|Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam}}\n[[File:Shah Abbas I.jpg|thumb|left|Shah Abbas I of Safavid at a banquet<br />Detail from a ceiling fresco; Chehel Sotoun palace; Isfahan]]\n\nThe [[Safavid]] ([[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviyeh]]) were a [[Sufi]] religious order centred in Iran and formed in the 1330s by [[Sheikh Safi Al-Din]] (1252\u20131334), after whom it was eponymously named.\n\nThis Sufi order openly converted to the heterodox branch of twelver [[Shi'a Islam]] by the end of the 15th century. Some Safavid followers, most notably the [[Qizilbash]], believed in the mystical and esoteric nature of their rulers and their relationship to the house of [[Ali]], and thus, were zealously predisposed to fight for them. The Safavid rulers claimed to be descended from Ali himself and his wife [[Fatimah]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], through the seventh [[Imam]] [[Musa al-Kazim]]. [[Qizilbash]] numbers increased by the 16th century and their generals were able to wage a successful war against the [[Ak Koyunlu]] state and capture Tabriz.\n\nThe Safavids, led by Ismail I, expanded their base in [[Ardabil]], conquering the [[Caucasus]], parts of [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Central Asia]], and western parts of [[South Asia]]. During the same period, Ismail sacked Baku in 1501 and persecuted the Sunni [[Shirvanshahs]]. The territory of nowadays Azerbaijan was conquered by the Iranian Safavids, alongside Armenia and Dagestan, between 1500 and 1502.<ref name=\"Immortal pg.43\">Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces, By Steven R. Ward, pg.43</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Ismail I]] and his son [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]], [[Shi'a Islam]] was imposed upon the formerly Sunni population of Iran and Azerbaijan. Imposition of Shi'a Islam was especially harsh in Shirvan, where a large Sunni population was massacred. Safavid Iran became a feudal theocracy during this period and the Shah was held to be the divinely ordained head of state and religion. During this period, the Qizilbashi chiefs were designated ''wakils'' (or legal administrators) with offices in charge of provincial administration and the class of Shia Islamic [[Ulema]] was created.\n\nThe wars with the Sunni [[Ottoman Empire]], the archrivals of the Safavids, continued during the reign of Shah [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]]. The important Safavid cities of [[Shamakha]], Ganja and Baku were occupied by Ottomans in the 1580s.\n\nUnder the reign of [[Shah Abbas I]] the Great (1587\u20131630) the monarchy peaked and took on a distinctly Persian national identity that merged with Shi'a Islam. Abbas I's reign represented the high point of development of the state and he was able to repel the Ottomans and re-capture the entire Caucasus, including what is now Azerbaijan and Shirvan in 1603. Being aware of the interfering power of the [[Qizilbash]], he continued the same policy as his predecessors namely fully integrated the [[Caucasus]] and its elements into Persian society.

Iran lost control over the whole of Azerbaijan, and with the Turkemenchai settlement of 1828 Russia threatened to establish its control over Azerbaijan unless Iran paid a war indemnity.

(1804\u201313) The commander-in-chief appointed by Russia was infamous Pavel Tsitsianov, called <nowiki>''</nowiki>ishpokdor<nowiki>''</nowiki> meaning \"his work is dirt\", or \"shedder of blood\" by Iranian chronicler Muriel Atkin. Tsitsianov's main destructions took place in the historical city of Ganja now in Azerbaijan, including the change of city's name to Elizavetpol.  He has functioned from 1803 to 1806, until his assassination in Baku.\n\nFollowing their defeat by Russia, Qajar Iran was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813, which acknowledged the loss of [[Dagestan]], Georgia and most of [[Azerbaijan]] territory to Russia. Local khanates were either abolished (like in Baku or Ganja) or accepted Russian patronage. The end of Russo-Persian war in 1813 was marked with the [[Treaty of Gulistan]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|Another Russo-Persian war in 1826\u201328]] resulted in another defeat for the Iranian army. The Russians dictated another infamous final settlement as per the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], which resulted in the [[Qajars]] of Persia ceding their last remaining Caucasian territories in 1828, comprising the last parts of the modern day Azerbaijani republic that were still in the latter's hands ([[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchivan]], [[Lankaran Khanate]]) as well as modern-day [[Armenia]] ([[Erivan Khanate]]). Besides these changes in administration and sovereignty of khanates, the treaty of Turkmenchai had articles concerning the tariffs, especially of lowering the tariffs for the possibility of flow of Russian goods; and on legal concessions such that grants Russia the right to keep a navy in the Caspian Sea.

The Azerbaijani Turks were affected by Russian restrictions against non-Christians.The Russian state made concerted efforts to control the application of Islamic law in the empire. Two Ecclesiastical Boards were created to oversee all religious Islamic activity. The state appointed a mufti for the Sunni board and a sheikh al-Islam for the Shia. In 1857 Georgian and Armenian religious authorities were given oversight in censoring their respective communities, however, Muslim religious works and books had to be approved by a censorship board in Odessa.

When the new legal system came into effect in January 1841, Transcaucasia was divided into a Georgian-Imeretian province, and a Caspian ''oblast'' centered in Shemakhi. New administrative borders were later drawn that ignored historical borders or ethnic composition. By the end of military rule in Azerbaijan, Russian imperial law achieved hegemony in all criminal and most civil matters. The jurisdiction of traditional religious courts and ''qadis'' were reduced to family law. The Russian state made concerted efforts to control the application of Islamic law in the empire.  As a result of a catastrophic earthquake in 1859, the capital of the eastern province was transferred from [[Shamakhi]] to [[Baku]]<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule|last=Altstadt|first=Audrey|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8179-9182-4|location=Stanford, California|pages=18, 21}}</ref> which attained greater importance over time.\n\n'''Baku''' [[File:102 329 nobel oilwells.jpg|thumb|Oil derricks in Balakhany district, late 19th century]]\nAfter the treaty of Gulistan in 1813, Baku was fully integrated into Russian Empire.

Azerbaijan's first oil refinery was established near Baku in 1859, and the region's first kerosene plant was erected in 1863. Wells built in 1870's sparked the boom. Oil bearing lands were soon auctioned off to bidders. This system secured investors\u2019 property and encouraged further investment in their holdings\u2019 operations. Most of the people to acquire oil lands were elite Russians and Armenians, by contrast of 51 plots sold at the first auction only 5 were bought by Azerbaijani Turks. Additionally of 54 oil extraction firms in Baku in 1888, only 2 notable companies were owned by Azerbaijanis. Azerbaijani Turks participated in greater numbers among small-scale extraction and refining operations. 73 of 162 oil refineries were Azerbaijani owned, but all but 7 of them were employed less than 15 people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Azerbaijani Turks|last=Altstadt|first=Audrey|publisher=Hoover Institutional press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Stanford University|pages=20\u201321}}</ref> In the decades following the oil rush and foreign investment other industries grew in Azerbaijan.The banking system was one of the first to react to the oil industry In 1880 an offshoot of the state bank opened in Baku, in the first year of operation it issued 438,000 rubles, in 1899 all Baku banking institutions had issued 11.4 million rubles in all interest bearing securities. Transportation and shipping industries also grew as a result of the expanding oil market. The number of vessels on the Caspian quadrupled between 1887 and 1899. The [[Transcaucasus Railway|Transcaucasian Railway]], completed in 1884, connected [[Baku]] on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast to [[Batumi|Batum]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast via [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] ([[Elizavetpol'|Elizavetpol]]) and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity under Russian Rule|last=Altstadt|first=Audrey|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8179-9181-6|location=Stanford, CA|page=23}}</ref> In addition to transporting oil, the railroad served to develop new relationships between rural agricultural areas and industrial zones.<ref name=\":03\" /> The connectivity of the region was further increased by the implementation of new communication infrastructure, with telegraph lines connecting [[Baku]] to [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] via [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] ([[Elizavetpol'|Elizavetpol]]) in the 1860s, and a telephone system operating within [[Baku]] in the 1880s.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe rush was spurred by Armenian oil magnate [[Ivan Mirzoev|Mirzoev]] and his drilling practices, which were then replaced by the auction of oil lands, most of which were purchased by Russians and Armenians, followed by Europeans, most notably [[Robert Nobel]] of [[Branobel]].<ref name=\":1\" /> By 1900, the population of Baku increased from 10,000 to roughly 250,000 people as a result of worker migration from all over the [[Russian Empire]], [[Iran]], and other places. The growth of Baku and the progression of an exploitative economy resulted in the emergence of an Azeri nationalist intelligentsia that was educated and influenced by European and Ottoman ideas. Influential thinkers like [[Hasan bey Zardabi]], [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] and later, [[Jalil Mammadguluzadeh]], [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir]], [[Nariman Narimanov]] and others spurred a nationalist discourse and rallied against poverty, ignorance, extremism and sought reforms in education and the emancipation of the dispossessed classes, including women. The financial support of philanthropist millionaires such as [[Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]] also bolstered the rise of an Azeri middle-class.\n\nFollowing the disastrous [[Russo-Japanese war]], an economic and political crisis erupted in Baku, starting with a general strike of oil workers in 1904. In 1905, class and ethnic tensions resulted in [[Armenian\u2013Tatar massacres of 1905\u20131907|Muslim-Armenian ethnic rioting]] during the first [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution]]. The Tsarist governments had, in fact, exploited ethnic and religious strife to maintain control in a policy of divide and rule.\n\nThe situation improved during 1906\u20131914, when a limited parliamentary system was introduced in Russia and Muslim MPs from Azerbaijan were actively promoting Azeri interests. In 1911, the pan-Turkist and pan-Islamist [[Musavat]] Party,<ref>''Pan-Turkism: From Irrendentism to Cooperation'' by Jacob M.

Founded clandestinely, the party expanded rapidly in 1917, after the overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia. The most essential components of the Musavat ideology were secularism, [[nationalism]], and federalism, or autonomy within a broader political structure. However, the party's right- and left-wings differed on certain issues, most notably land distribution. The leader of the party was the left-leaning [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]].\n\nAfter Russia became involved in World War I, social and economic tensions spiked again. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] ultimately led to the granting of rights to the local population of the territory that nowadays constitutes Azerbaijan and the granting of self-rule, but this autonomy also led to renewed ethnic conflict between ethnic Azeris and Armenians.\n\n== Azerbaijan Democratic Republic ==\n[[File:Mammad Amin Rasulzade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]] was one of the founding leaders and speaker of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918, he was widely regarded as the national leader of Azerbaijan.]]\n{{Main|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918 - 1920)|March Days|Battle of Baku}}\nAt the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1917, the [[Transcaucasian Republic]] was founded with the leading Armenian and Georgian intelligentsia.

In Baku, however, a coalition of [[Bolsheviks]], [[Dashnaks]] and [[Mensheviks]] fought against a Turkish-Islamic army led by [[Nuru Pasha]]. This coalition known as the \"[[Baku Commune]]\" also inspired or tacitly condoned the [[March Days|massacres of local Muslims]] by well-armed Dashnak-Armenian forces. This coalition, however, collapsed and was replaced by a British-controlled government known as [[Central Caspian Dictatorship]]  in July 1918.  As a result of battles in August\u2013September, on September 15, 1918 the joint forces of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and Ottoman Empire led by Nuru Pasha entered Baku and declared the city as a capital of young Azerbaijani state. This event has always been considered one of the most honorable pages of the Azerbaijani history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan.az/portal/History/Middle/middle_03_a.html|title=Article about Azerbaijan first Republic in Muslim East}}</ref>\n\nAzerbaijan was proclaimed a secular republic and its first parliament opened on December 5, 1918. British administration initially did not recognize the Republic but tacitly cooperated with it. By mid-1919 the situation in Azerbaijan had more or less stabilized, and British forces left in August 1919. However, by early 1920, advancing Bolshevik forces, victorious in [[Russian Civil War]], started to pose a great threat to young republic, which also engaged in a conflict with Armenia over the [[Karabakh]].\n\nAzerbaijan received ''de facto'' recognition by the Allies as an independent nation in January 1920 at the Versailles [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The republic was governed by five cabinets, all formed by a coalition of the [[Musavat]] and other parties including the Socialist Bloc, the Independents, the Liberals, the Social-Democratic Party [[Hummat]] (or Endeavor) Party and the Conservative [[Ittihad]] (Union) Party. The premier in the first three cabinets was [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]]; in the last two, [[Nasib Yusifbeyli]]. The president of the parliament, [[Alimardan Topchubashev]], was recognized as the head of state. In this capacity he represented Azerbaijan at the Versailles [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nAided by Azeri dissidents in the Republican government, the [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan on April 28, 1920. The bulk of the newly formed [[Military of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani army]] was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh. The Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918\u201320 quickly or easily.

Shortly after, the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] was held in September 1920 in Baku. Although formally an independent state, the Azerbaijan SSR was dependent upon and controlled by the government in Moscow. It was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] along with Armenia and Georgia in March 1922. By an agreement signed in December 1922, the TSFSR became one of the four original republics of the Soviet Union. The TSFSR was dissolved in 1936 and its three regions became separate republics within the USSR.\n\nLike other union republics, Azerbaijan was affected by Stalin's purges in the 1930s. During that period, sometimes referred to as the \"Red Terror\", thousands of people were killed, including notable Azeri figures such as [[Huseyn Javid]], [[Mikail Mushvig]], Ruhulla Akhundov, Ayna Sultanova and others. Directing the purges in Azerbaijan was [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]], the first secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, who followed Stalin's orders without question.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} His special target was the intelligentsia, but he also purged Communist leaders who had sympathized with the opposition or who might have once leaned toward [[Pan-Turkism]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} or had contacts with revolutionary movements in Iran or Turkey.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Azerbaijan SSR supplied much of the Soviet Union's gas and oil during the war with [[Nazi Germany]] and was thus a strategically important region. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 reached the [[Greater Caucasus]] in July 1942, but the Germans never crossed into the territory of Azerbaijan. Many Azerbaijanis fought well in the ranks of the Soviet Army{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} (about 600\u2013800,000) and Azeri [[Major-General]] [[Azi Aslanov]] was awarded twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. About 400,000 Azeris died in World War II. The Germans also made fruitless efforts to enlist the cooperation of emigre political figures, most notably [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nPolicies of de-Stalinization and improvement after the 1950s led to better education and welfare conditions for most of Azerbaijan.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This also coincided with the period of rapid urbanization and industrialization. During this period of change, a new wave of ''[[Russification#Late 1950s to 1980s: Advanced Russianization|sblizheniye]]'' (reapprochment) policy was instituted in order to merge all the peoples of the U.S.S.R. into a new monolithic Soviet nation.\n\nIn the 1960s, the signs of a structural crisis in the Soviet system began to emerge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Azerbaijan's crucial oil industry lost its relative importance in the Soviet economy, partly because of a shift of oil production to other regions of the Soviet Union and partly because of the depletion of known oil resources on land, while offshore production was not deemed cost effective. As a result, Azerbaijan had the lowest rate of growth in productivity and economic output among the Soviet republics, with the exception of [[Tajikistan]]. Ethnic tensions, particularly between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, began to grow, but violence was suppressed.\n\nIn an attempt to end the growing structural crisis, in 1969, the government in Moscow appointed [[Heydar Aliyev]] as the first secretary of the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]]. Aliyev temporarily improved economic conditions and promoted alternative industries to the declining oil industry, such as cotton. He also consolidated the republic's ruling elite, which now consisted almost entirely of ethnic Azeris, thus reverting the previous trends at \"rapprochement\". In 1982, Aliyev was made a member of the Communist Party's Politburo in Moscow, the highest position ever attained by an Azeri in the Soviet Union. In 1987, when ''[[Perestroika]]'' started, he was forced{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} to retire by the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] whose policies Aliyev opposed.\n\n{{Anchor|1985\u20131991}}\n\nThe late 1980s, during the Gorbachev era, were characterized by increasing unrest in the Caucasus, initially over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] issue. A political awakening came in February 1988 with the renewal of the ethnic conflict, which centered on Armenian demands for the unification of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of Azerbaijan SSR\nArmenia by March 1988, while pogroms of the Armenian population in Baku and [[Sumgait]] took place. Russia forced enforced military rule on several occasions but unrest continued to spread.\n\nThe ethnic strife revealed the shortcomings of the Communist Party as a champion of national interests, and, in the spirit of ''[[glasnost]]'', independent publications and political organizations began to emerge. Of these organizations, by far the most prominent was the [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]] (PFA),{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} which by the fall of 1989 seemed poised to take power from the Communist Party. The PFA soon experienced a split between a conservative-Islamic wing and a moderate wing. The split was followed by an outbreak of anti-Armenian violence in Baku and intervention by Soviet troops.\n\nUnrest culminated in violent confrontation when [[Black January|Soviet troops killed 132 nationalist demonstrators]] in Baku on January 20, 1990. Azerbaijan declared its independence from the USSR on August 30, 1991, and became part of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. By the end of 1991, [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh]] had escalated into a full-scale war, which culminated into a tense cease-fire that has persisted into the 21st century. Although a cease-fire was achieved, the refusal to negotiate by both sides resulted in a stalemate as Armenian troops retained their positions in Karabakh as well as corridors taken from Azerbaijan that connect the enclave to Armenia.\n\n== Independent Azerbaijan ==\n{{Main|Politics of Azerbaijan}}\n\n=== Mutalibov presidency (1991\u20131992) ===\nWhile during 1990\u20131991 Azerbaijan gave more sacrifices in a struggle for independence from the USSR than any other Soviet republic,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} the declaration of independence introduced by President [[Ayaz Mutalibov]] on August 30, 1991 followed the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]].\nM\u00fctallibov becomes the only Soviet leader besides [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] to endorse the Soviet coup attempt by issuing a statement from Tehran, while later dissolving the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]] and proposing constitutional changes for direct nationwide elections of the president.\n\nOn September 8, 1991, the [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1991|first nationwide presidential elections]], in which Mutalibov was the only running candidate, were held in Azerbaijan. While the elections were neither free nor fair by international standards, Mutalibov formally became the elected president of Azerbaijan. The adoption of the [[declaration of independence]] by the [[Supreme Soviet]] of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] on October 18, 1991, was followed by a dissolution of the [[Azerbaijani Communist Party]]. However, its former members, including President [[Ayaz Mutalibov]], retained their political posts.\n\nIn December 1991 in a nationwide referendum, Azerbaijani voters approved the Declaration of Independence adopted by the Supreme Council; with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan is recognized as independent state at first by [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Romania]] and [[Pakistan]]. The [[United States]] followed suit on December 25.\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict over [[Nagorno Karabakh]] continued despite the efforts to negotiate a settlement. Early in 1992, Karabakh's Armenian leadership proclaimed an independent republic. In what was now a full-scale war between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the Armenians gained the upper hand, with covert assistance from the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]]. Major atrocities were committed by both sides, with the [[Khojaly massacre]] of Azerbaijani civilians on February 25, 1992 causing a social uproar over the government inaction (also was the Maragha Massacre, in which Azeris killed indigenous Armenian civilians). M\u00fctallibov was forced to submit his resignation to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan on March 6, under pressure from the [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]].\n\nMutalibov's failure to build up an adequate army, that he feared may not remain under his control, brought about the downfall of his government. On May 6 the last Azerbaijani-populated town in Nagorno-Karabakh, [[Shusha]], falls under Armenian control. On May 14 the [[Supreme Council of Azerbaijan]] hears the case on the [[Khojaly Massacre]], relieves M\u00fctallibov of any responsibility, reverses his prior resignation and restores him as the President of Azerbaijan, but the day after, May 15, armed forces led by the [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]] take control of the offices of the [[Parliament of Azerbaijan]] and [[Azerbaijani State Radio]] and [[Television in Azerbaijan#State-owned|Television]], thereby deposing M\u00fctallibov, who leaves for Moscow; the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan is dissolved passing the duties to the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] formed by equal representation of Azerbaijan Popular Front and former communists. Two days later, while Armenian forces take control of Lachin, [[Isa Gambar]] is elected as the new Chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan and takes on the temporary duties of President of Azerbaijan until the national elections due on June 17, 1992.\n\n===Elchibey presidency (1992\u20131993)===\nThe former Communists failed to present a viable candidate at the [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1992|1992 elections]] and [[Abulfaz Elchibey]], the leader of the [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]] (PFA) and former dissident and political prisoner, was elected president with more than 60% of the vote. His program included opposition to Azerbaijan's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], closer relations with [[Turkey]], and a desire for extended links with the [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]].\n\n[[Heydar Aliyev]], who had been prevented from running for president by an age limit of 65, was doing well in [[Nakhichevan District|Nakhichevan]]. He had to contend with an Armenian blockade of Nakhichevan. In turn, Armenia suffered when Azerbaijan halted all rail traffic into and out of Armenia, cutting most of its land links with the outside world. The negative economic effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict]] seemed to illustrate the interdependence of the [[Transcaucasian]] nations.\n\nWithin a year after his election, President Elchibey came to face the same situation that had led to the downfall of Mutalibov. The fighting in and around [[Nagorno Karabakh]] steadily turned in favor of the Armenians, who seized around one fifth of Azerbaijan's territory, creating more than a million [[internally displaced persons]]. A military rebellion against Abulfaz Elchibey broke out in early June 1993 in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] under the leadership of Colonel [[Surat Huseynov]]. The [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]] leadership found itself without political support as a result of the war's setbacks, a steadily deteriorating economy, and opposition from groups led by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. In Baku, Aliyev seized the reins of power and quickly consolidated his position. A [[Azerbaijani vote of confidence referendum, 1993|confidence referendum in August]] deprived Elchibey of his post.\n\n=== Heydar Aliyev presidency (1993\u20132003) ===\n[[File:Heydar Aliyev 1997.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Former Azerbaijani President [[Heydar Aliyev]] was the first Azeri member of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]].]]\n\n[[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1993|On 3 October 1993 a presidential election]] was held, and Aliyev won overwhelmingly.\nBy March 1994, Aliyev was able to get rid of some of his opposition including [[Surat Huseynov]], who was arrested along with other rivals. In 1995, the former military police [[1995 Azeri coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|were accused of plotting a coup and disbanded]]. Coup plotters were linked to [[Nationalist Movement Party|right wing Turkish nationalists]]. Later, in 1996 [[R\u0259sul Quliyev]], former speaker of parliament went into self-imposed exile. Thus, by end of 1996, position of Heydar Aliyev as an ''absolute ruler'' in Azerbaijan was unquestionable.\n\nAs a result of limited reforms and the signing of the so-called \"Contract of The Century\" in October 1994 (over the [[Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] giant oil field) that led to increased oil exports to western markets, the economy began improving. However, extreme levels of [[corruption]] and [[nepotism]] in the state system created by Aliyev prevented Azerbaijan from more sustained development, especially in the non-oil sector.\n\nIn October 1998, Aliev was [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1998|re-elected as president for a second term]]. Weakened opposition accused him of voter fraud, but no widespread international condemnation of the elections followed. His second term in office was characterized by limited reforms, increasing oil production and the dominance of [[British Petroleum]] as a main foreign oil company in Azerbaijan. In early 1999, a giant [[Shah Deniz gas field]] was discovered making Azerbaijan potentially a major gas exporter. A gas export agreement was signed with [[Turkey]] by 2003. Work on a long-awaited [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline]] started in 2003. The oil pipeline was completed in 2005 and the gas pipeline in 2006. Azerbaijan is also a party to the proposed [[Nabucco Pipeline]].\n\n[[File:Munich Security Conference 2010 - Ilham Aliyev.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ilham Aliyev]]]]\nHeydar Aliyev fell ill and, in April 2003, collapsed on stage and could not return to public life.

The election was characterized by mass violence and was criticised by foreign observers.  Presently, political opposition to the Aliyev administration remains strong.  Many were not satisfied with this new dynastical succession and were pushing for a more democratic government. Ilham Aliyev was [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 2008|re-elected in 2008]] with 87% of the polls, while opposition parties boycotted the elections. In a [[Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum in 2009]], [[term limit]]s for the presidency were abolished and [[freedom of the press]] was restricted.\n\nThe [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]] produced a Parliament completely loyal to Aliyev: for the first time in Azerbaijani history, not a single candidate from the main opposition [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]] or [[Musavat]] parties was elected.\n''[[The Economist]]'' scored [[Azerbaijan]] as an [[authoritarian regime]], placing it 135th out of 167 countries, in its 2010 [[Democracy Index]].\n\n[[2011 Azerbaijani protests|Repeated protests]] were staged against Aliyev's rule in 2011, calling for democratic reforms and the ouster of the government.

This earliest Persian Empire had a profound impact upon local population as the religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] became ascendant as did various early Persian cultural influences. Many of the local peoples of Caucasian Albania came to be known as fire worshippers, which may be a sign of their Zoroastrian faith.\n\nThis empire lasted over 250 years and was conquered later by [[Alexander the Great]] and led to the rise of [[Hellenistic]] culture throughout the former Persian Empire. The [[Seleucid]] Greeks inherited the Caucasus following Alexander's death in 323 BCE, but were ultimately beset by pressures from Rome, secessionist Greeks in [[Bactria]], and most adversely the Parthians (''[[Parni]]''), another nomadic Iranian tribe from Central Asia, which made serious inroads into the northern eastern Seleucid domains from the late 4th century BCE to the 3rd century BCE and this ultimately allowed local Caucasian tribes to establish an independent kingdom for the first time since the Median invasion.\n\n===Caucasian Albania, the Parthians, and the Sassanian conquest===\n{{Main|Caucasian Albania|Parthian Empire|Roman-Parthian Wars|Sassanian Empire}}\n[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|right|Roman inscription in [[Qobustan, Absheron|Qobustan]]]]\n[[File:Mis qab, X\u0131n\u0131sl\u0131.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sassanid]] silver plate excavated in [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]], ([[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]])]]\n\nThe Albanian kingdom coalesced around a native Caucasian identity to forge a unique state in a region of vast empire-states. However, in the 2nd or 1st century BCE the Armenians considerably curtailed the Albanian territories to the south and conquered the territories of Karabakh and Utik, populated by various Albanian tribes, such as [[Udi people|Utians]], Gargarians and [[Caspians]].<ref>Hewsen, Robert H., Ethno-History and the Armenian Influence upon the Caucasian Albanians, in: Samuelian, Thomas J.

However at the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] Turkic tribes emanating from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the [[Ghaznavids]] from northern [[Afghanistan]], who took over part of Azerbaijan by 1030. They were followed by the Seljuqs, a western branch of the Oghuz who conquered all of Iran and the Caucasus and pressed on to Iraq where they overthrew the Buyids in Baghdad in 1055.\n\nThe Seljuqs became the main rulers of a vast empire that included all of Iran and Azerbaijan until the end of the 12th century. During the Seljuq period, the influential vizier of the Seljuq sultans, [[Nizam ul-Mulk]] (a noted Persian scholar and administrator) is noted for having helped introduce numerous educational and bureaucratic reforms. His death in 1092 marked the beginning of the decline of the once well-organized Seljuq state that further deteriorated following the death of Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] in 1153.\n\nLocally, Seljuq possessions were ruled by [[Atabegs]], who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans, but sometimes became de facto rulers themselves. The title of ''Atabeg'' was common during the Seljuq rule of the Middle East starting in the 12th century. Under their rule from the end of 12th to early 13th centuries, Azerbaijan emerged as an important cultural centre of the Turkic people. Palaces of the Atabeg ''Eldegizids'' (eldeniz) and the ''Shirvanshahs'' hosted distinguished people of the time, many of whom were outstanding Muslim artisans and scientists. The most famous of the Atabeg rulers was [[Ildeniz|Shams al-din Eldeqiz]] (Eldeniz).\n\nUnder the Seljuqs, great progress was achieved in different sciences and philosophy by Iranians like [[Bahmanyar]], Khatib Tabrizi, [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and others. Persian poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani Shirvani]], who lived in this region, epitomise the highest point in refined medieval Persian literature. In addition, the region experience a building boom and the unique of architecture of the Seljuq period is epitomized by the fortress walls, mosques, schools, mausoleums, and bridges of Baku, Ganja and Absheron which were built during the 12th century.\n\nIn 1225, [[Mingburnu|Jalaleddin Kharazmshah]] of [[Khwarezmid Empire]] put an end to the Atabeg rule.\n\n===Mongols and Ilkhanid rule===\n{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}\nThe Mongol invasion of the Middle East and Caucasus was a devastating event for Azerbaijan and most of its neighbors. From 1220, Begin beg began to pay tributes to the Mongols. [[Jebe]] and [[Subotai]] made the small state neutral. In 1231, the [[Mongols]] occupied most of Azerbaijan and killed the [[Khorezmshah]] [[Mingburnu|Jalaladdin]], who had overthrown the Atabeg dynasty. In 1235 the Mongols destroyed cities of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[\u015e\u0259mkir|Shamkir]], [[Tovuz, Azerbaijan|Tovuz]], [[Shabran Rayon|Shabran]] on their way to conquer [[Kievan Russia]]. By the 1236, all of Transcaucasia was in the hands of [[Ogedei khan]].\n\n=== The end of Mongol rule and the Kara Koyunlu-Agh Koyunlu rivalry ===\n{{main|Ak Koyunlu|Kara Koyunlu}}\n[[File:M\u00f6m\u00fcn\u0259xatun t\u00fcrb\u0259si 2018.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] in [[Nakhchivan City]]]]\n\n[[Tamerlane]] (Amir Timur) launched a devastating invasion of Azerbaijan in the 1380s, and temporarily incorporated Azerbaijan into his vast domain that spanned much of Eurasia. The [[Shirvanshah]] state under [[Shirvanshah Ibrahim I]] were also vassals of [[Timur]] and assisted Timur in his war with the Mongol ruler [[Tokhtamysh]] of the [[Golden Horde]]. Azerbaijan experienced social unrest and religious strife during this period due to sectarian conflict initiated by [[Hurufism|Hurufi]], [[Bektashi]] and other movements.\n\nFollowing Timur's death in 1405, his fourth son [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah-Rukh]] came to power and reigned until 1446. To the west of Shah-Rukh's domain two new rival Turkic states emerged \u2013 the ''[[Kara Koyunlu]]'' based around Lake Van and the [[Ak Koyunlu]] (or ''White Sheep Turks'') centred around Diyarbak\u0131r. Initially, it was the Kara Koyunlu who were ascendant when their chief [[Kara Yusuf]] overcame [[Sultan Ahmad]], the last of Jalayirids, and conquered lands south of Azerbaijan in 1410, establishing his capital at Tabriz. Under [[Jihan Shah|Jahan-Shah]], the Kara Koyunlu expanded their territory into central Iran and as far east as Khurasan. Later, however, the Ak Koyunlu came into greater prominence under [[Uzun Hasan]], overcoming [[Jihan Shah|Jahan-Shah]] and the Qara Qoyunlu in 1468. [[Uzun Hasan]] ruled all of Iran, Azerbaijan and Iraq until his death in 1478. Both Ak Koyunlu and Kara Koyunlu, continued the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] tradition of generous patrons of literature, poetry and the arts as the renowned [[Persian miniature|Islamic miniature]] paintings of Tabriz illustrate.\n\n=== The Shirvanshahs ===\n[[File:Baku ShirvanshahsBurialVault 004 1365.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Turbe (mausoleum) of Shirvanshahs in Baku, 15th century]]\n{{Main|Shirvanshahs}}\n\nSh\u012brw\u0101n Sh\u0101h<ref name=\"EIB\">Barthold, W., C.E.

The Shirvanshahs maintained a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539, and provided a continuity that lasted longer than any other dynasty in the Islamic world. There are two periods of an independent Shirvan state: first in the 12th century, under Sultans Manuchehr and Axsitan who built the stronghold of [[Baku]], and second in the 15th century under the [[House of Derbent|Derbendid]] dynasty. Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the Shirvanshahs were vassals of the Mongol and Timurid empires.\n\nThe [[Shirvanshahs]] [[Khalilullah I]] and [[Farrukh Yassar]] presided over a highly stable period in the history of the dynasty. The architectural complex of the \"Shirvanshah palace\" in Baku (that was also a burial site of the dynasty) and the [[Halwatiyya]] Sufi Khaneqa were built during the reign of these two rulers in the mid-15th century. The Shirvanshah rulers were more or less Orthodox [[Sunni]], and thus opposed the heterodox [[Shi'a Islam]] of the [[Safavid]] [[Sufi]] order. In 1462 [[Shaykh Junayd]], the leader of Safavids was killed in battle against [[Shirvanishans]], near the town of [[Gusar]] (he was buried in the village [[H\u0259zr\u0259, Qusar|Hazra]]) \u2013 an event that shaped subsequent Safavid actions leading to a new phase in the history of Azerbaijan.\n\n== Safavids and the rise of Shi'a Islam ==\n{{Main|Safavids|Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam}}\n[[File:Shah Abbas I.jpg|thumb|left|Shah Abbas I of Safavid at a banquet<br />Detail from a ceiling fresco; Chehel Sotoun palace; Isfahan]]\n\nThe [[Safavid]] ([[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviyeh]]) were a [[Sufi]] religious order centred in Iran and formed in the 1330s by [[Sheikh Safi Al-Din]] (1252\u20131334), after whom it was eponymously named.\n\nThis Sufi order openly converted to the heterodox branch of twelver [[Shi'a Islam]] by the end of the 15th century. Some Safavid followers, most notably the [[Qizilbash]], believed in the mystical and esoteric nature of their rulers and their relationship to the house of [[Ali]], and thus, were zealously predisposed to fight for them. The Safavid rulers claimed to be descended from Ali himself and his wife [[Fatimah]], daughter of [[Muhammad]], through the seventh [[Imam]] [[Musa al-Kazim]]. [[Qizilbash]] numbers increased by the 16th century and their generals were able to wage a successful war against the [[Ak Koyunlu]] state and capture Tabriz.\n\nThe Safavids, led by Ismail I, expanded their base in [[Ardabil]], conquering the [[Caucasus]], parts of [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Central Asia]], and western parts of [[South Asia]]. During the same period, Ismail sacked Baku in 1501 and persecuted the Sunni [[Shirvanshahs]]. The territory of nowadays Azerbaijan was conquered by the Iranian Safavids, alongside Armenia and Dagestan, between 1500 and 1502.<ref name=\"Immortal pg.43\">Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces, By Steven R. Ward, pg.43</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of [[Ismail I]] and his son [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]], [[Shi'a Islam]] was imposed upon the formerly Sunni population of Iran and Azerbaijan. Imposition of Shi'a Islam was especially harsh in Shirvan, where a large Sunni population was massacred. Safavid Iran became a feudal theocracy during this period and the Shah was held to be the divinely ordained head of state and religion. During this period, the Qizilbashi chiefs were designated ''wakils'' (or legal administrators) with offices in charge of provincial administration and the class of Shia Islamic [[Ulema]] was created.\n\nThe wars with the Sunni [[Ottoman Empire]], the archrivals of the Safavids, continued during the reign of Shah [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasp]]. The important Safavid cities of [[Shamakha]], Ganja and Baku were occupied by Ottomans in the 1580s.\n\nUnder the reign of [[Shah Abbas I]] the Great (1587\u20131630) the monarchy peaked and took on a distinctly Persian national identity that merged with Shi'a Islam. Abbas I's reign represented the high point of development of the state and he was able to repel the Ottomans and re-capture the entire Caucasus, including what is now Azerbaijan and Shirvan in 1603. Being aware of the interfering power of the [[Qizilbash]], he continued the same policy as his predecessors namely fully integrated the [[Caucasus]] and its elements into Persian society.

Iran lost control over the whole of Azerbaijan, and with the Turkemenchai settlement of 1828 Russia threatened to establish its control over Azerbaijan unless Iran paid a war indemnity.

(1804\u201313) The commander-in-chief appointed by Russia was infamous Pavel Tsitsianov, called <nowiki>''</nowiki>ishpokdor<nowiki>''</nowiki> meaning \"his work is dirt\", or \"shedder of blood\" by Iranian chronicler Muriel Atkin. Tsitsianov's main destructions took place in the historical city of Ganja now in Azerbaijan, including the change of city's name to Elizavetpol.  He has functioned from 1803 to 1806, until his assassination in Baku.\n\nFollowing their defeat by Russia, Qajar Iran was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813, which acknowledged the loss of [[Dagestan]], Georgia and most of [[Azerbaijan]] territory to Russia. Local khanates were either abolished (like in Baku or Ganja) or accepted Russian patronage. The end of Russo-Persian war in 1813 was marked with the [[Treaty of Gulistan]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|Another Russo-Persian war in 1826\u201328]] resulted in another defeat for the Iranian army. The Russians dictated another infamous final settlement as per the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], which resulted in the [[Qajars]] of Persia ceding their last remaining Caucasian territories in 1828, comprising the last parts of the modern day Azerbaijani republic that were still in the latter's hands ([[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchivan]], [[Lankaran Khanate]]) as well as modern-day [[Armenia]] ([[Erivan Khanate]]). Besides these changes in administration and sovereignty of khanates, the treaty of Turkmenchai had articles concerning the tariffs, especially of lowering the tariffs for the possibility of flow of Russian goods; and on legal concessions such that grants Russia the right to keep a navy in the Caspian Sea.

The Azerbaijani Turks were affected by Russian restrictions against non-Christians.The Russian state made concerted efforts to control the application of Islamic law in the empire. Two Ecclesiastical Boards were created to oversee all religious Islamic activity. The state appointed a mufti for the Sunni board and a sheikh al-Islam for the Shia. In 1857 Georgian and Armenian religious authorities were given oversight in censoring their respective communities, however, Muslim religious works and books had to be approved by a censorship board in Odessa.

When the new legal system came into effect in January 1841, Transcaucasia was divided into a Georgian-Imeretian province, and a Caspian ''oblast'' centered in Shemakhi. New administrative borders were later drawn that ignored historical borders or ethnic composition. By the end of military rule in Azerbaijan, Russian imperial law achieved hegemony in all criminal and most civil matters. The jurisdiction of traditional religious courts and ''qadis'' were reduced to family law. The Russian state made concerted efforts to control the application of Islamic law in the empire.  As a result of a catastrophic earthquake in 1859, the capital of the eastern province was transferred from [[Shamakhi]] to [[Baku]]<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule|last=Altstadt|first=Audrey|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8179-9182-4|location=Stanford, California|pages=18, 21}}</ref> which attained greater importance over time.\n\n'''Baku''' [[File:102 329 nobel oilwells.jpg|thumb|Oil derricks in Balakhany district, late 19th century]]\nAfter the treaty of Gulistan in 1813, Baku was fully integrated into Russian Empire.

Azerbaijan's first oil refinery was established near Baku in 1859, and the region's first kerosene plant was erected in 1863. Wells built in 1870's sparked the boom. Oil bearing lands were soon auctioned off to bidders. This system secured investors\u2019 property and encouraged further investment in their holdings\u2019 operations. Most of the people to acquire oil lands were elite Russians and Armenians, by contrast of 51 plots sold at the first auction only 5 were bought by Azerbaijani Turks. Additionally of 54 oil extraction firms in Baku in 1888, only 2 notable companies were owned by Azerbaijanis. Azerbaijani Turks participated in greater numbers among small-scale extraction and refining operations. 73 of 162 oil refineries were Azerbaijani owned, but all but 7 of them were employed less than 15 people.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Azerbaijani Turks|last=Altstadt|first=Audrey|publisher=Hoover Institutional press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Stanford University|pages=20\u201321}}</ref> In the decades following the oil rush and foreign investment other industries grew in Azerbaijan.The banking system was one of the first to react to the oil industry In 1880 an offshoot of the state bank opened in Baku, in the first year of operation it issued 438,000 rubles, in 1899 all Baku banking institutions had issued 11.4 million rubles in all interest bearing securities. Transportation and shipping industries also grew as a result of the expanding oil market. The number of vessels on the Caspian quadrupled between 1887 and 1899. The [[Transcaucasus Railway|Transcaucasian Railway]], completed in 1884, connected [[Baku]] on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast to [[Batumi|Batum]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast via [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] ([[Elizavetpol'|Elizavetpol]]) and [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|title=The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity under Russian Rule|last=Altstadt|first=Audrey|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8179-9181-6|location=Stanford, CA|page=23}}</ref> In addition to transporting oil, the railroad served to develop new relationships between rural agricultural areas and industrial zones.<ref name=\":03\" /> The connectivity of the region was further increased by the implementation of new communication infrastructure, with telegraph lines connecting [[Baku]] to [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] via [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] ([[Elizavetpol'|Elizavetpol]]) in the 1860s, and a telephone system operating within [[Baku]] in the 1880s.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nThe rush was spurred by Armenian oil magnate [[Ivan Mirzoev|Mirzoev]] and his drilling practices, which were then replaced by the auction of oil lands, most of which were purchased by Russians and Armenians, followed by Europeans, most notably [[Robert Nobel]] of [[Branobel]].<ref name=\":1\" /> By 1900, the population of Baku increased from 10,000 to roughly 250,000 people as a result of worker migration from all over the [[Russian Empire]], [[Iran]], and other places. The growth of Baku and the progression of an exploitative economy resulted in the emergence of an Azeri nationalist intelligentsia that was educated and influenced by European and Ottoman ideas. Influential thinkers like [[Hasan bey Zardabi]], [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] and later, [[Jalil Mammadguluzadeh]], [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir]], [[Nariman Narimanov]] and others spurred a nationalist discourse and rallied against poverty, ignorance, extremism and sought reforms in education and the emancipation of the dispossessed classes, including women. The financial support of philanthropist millionaires such as [[Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]] also bolstered the rise of an Azeri middle-class.\n\nFollowing the disastrous [[Russo-Japanese war]], an economic and political crisis erupted in Baku, starting with a general strike of oil workers in 1904. In 1905, class and ethnic tensions resulted in [[Armenian\u2013Tatar massacres of 1905\u20131907|Muslim-Armenian ethnic rioting]] during the first [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Russian Revolution]]. The Tsarist governments had, in fact, exploited ethnic and religious strife to maintain control in a policy of divide and rule.\n\nThe situation improved during 1906\u20131914, when a limited parliamentary system was introduced in Russia and Muslim MPs from Azerbaijan were actively promoting Azeri interests. In 1911, the pan-Turkist and pan-Islamist [[Musavat]] Party,<ref>''Pan-Turkism: From Irrendentism to Cooperation'' by Jacob M.

Founded clandestinely, the party expanded rapidly in 1917, after the overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia. The most essential components of the Musavat ideology were secularism, [[nationalism]], and federalism, or autonomy within a broader political structure. However, the party's right- and left-wings differed on certain issues, most notably land distribution. The leader of the party was the left-leaning [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]].\n\nAfter Russia became involved in World War I, social and economic tensions spiked again. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] ultimately led to the granting of rights to the local population of the territory that nowadays constitutes Azerbaijan and the granting of self-rule, but this autonomy also led to renewed ethnic conflict between ethnic Azeris and Armenians.\n\n== Azerbaijan Democratic Republic ==\n[[File:Mammad Amin Rasulzade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mammad Amin Rasulzade]] was one of the founding leaders and speaker of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918, he was widely regarded as the national leader of Azerbaijan.]]\n{{Main|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Armenian-Azerbaijani war (1918 - 1920)|March Days|Battle of Baku}}\nAt the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1917, the [[Transcaucasian Republic]] was founded with the leading Armenian and Georgian intelligentsia.

In Baku, however, a coalition of [[Bolsheviks]], [[Dashnaks]] and [[Mensheviks]] fought against a Turkish-Islamic army led by [[Nuru Pasha]]. This coalition known as the \"[[Baku Commune]]\" also inspired or tacitly condoned the [[March Days|massacres of local Muslims]] by well-armed Dashnak-Armenian forces. This coalition, however, collapsed and was replaced by a British-controlled government known as [[Central Caspian Dictatorship]]  in July 1918.  As a result of battles in August\u2013September, on September 15, 1918 the joint forces of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and Ottoman Empire led by Nuru Pasha entered Baku and declared the city as a capital of young Azerbaijani state. This event has always been considered one of the most honorable pages of the Azerbaijani history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan.az/portal/History/Middle/middle_03_a.html|title=Article about Azerbaijan first Republic in Muslim East}}</ref>\n\nAzerbaijan was proclaimed a secular republic and its first parliament opened on December 5, 1918. British administration initially did not recognize the Republic but tacitly cooperated with it. By mid-1919 the situation in Azerbaijan had more or less stabilized, and British forces left in August 1919. However, by early 1920, advancing Bolshevik forces, victorious in [[Russian Civil War]], started to pose a great threat to young republic, which also engaged in a conflict with Armenia over the [[Karabakh]].\n\nAzerbaijan received ''de facto'' recognition by the Allies as an independent nation in January 1920 at the Versailles [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. The republic was governed by five cabinets, all formed by a coalition of the [[Musavat]] and other parties including the Socialist Bloc, the Independents, the Liberals, the Social-Democratic Party [[Hummat]] (or Endeavor) Party and the Conservative [[Ittihad]] (Union) Party. The premier in the first three cabinets was [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]]; in the last two, [[Nasib Yusifbeyli]]. The president of the parliament, [[Alimardan Topchubashev]], was recognized as the head of state. In this capacity he represented Azerbaijan at the Versailles [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nAided by Azeri dissidents in the Republican government, the [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan on April 28, 1920. The bulk of the newly formed [[Military of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani army]] was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh. The Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918\u201320 quickly or easily.

Shortly after, the [[Congress of the Peoples of the East]] was held in September 1920 in Baku. Although formally an independent state, the Azerbaijan SSR was dependent upon and controlled by the government in Moscow. It was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] along with Armenia and Georgia in March 1922. By an agreement signed in December 1922, the TSFSR became one of the four original republics of the Soviet Union. The TSFSR was dissolved in 1936 and its three regions became separate republics within the USSR.\n\nLike other union republics, Azerbaijan was affected by Stalin's purges in the 1930s. During that period, sometimes referred to as the \"Red Terror\", thousands of people were killed, including notable Azeri figures such as [[Huseyn Javid]], [[Mikail Mushvig]], Ruhulla Akhundov, Ayna Sultanova and others. Directing the purges in Azerbaijan was [[Mir Jafar Baghirov]], the first secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, who followed Stalin's orders without question.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} His special target was the intelligentsia, but he also purged Communist leaders who had sympathized with the opposition or who might have once leaned toward [[Pan-Turkism]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} or had contacts with revolutionary movements in Iran or Turkey.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Azerbaijan SSR supplied much of the Soviet Union's gas and oil during the war with [[Nazi Germany]] and was thus a strategically important region. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 reached the [[Greater Caucasus]] in July 1942, but the Germans never crossed into the territory of Azerbaijan. Many Azerbaijanis fought well in the ranks of the Soviet Army{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} (about 600\u2013800,000) and Azeri [[Major-General]] [[Azi Aslanov]] was awarded twice [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. About 400,000 Azeris died in World War II. The Germans also made fruitless efforts to enlist the cooperation of emigre political figures, most notably [[Mammed Amin Rasulzade]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nPolicies of de-Stalinization and improvement after the 1950s led to better education and welfare conditions for most of Azerbaijan.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} This also coincided with the period of rapid urbanization and industrialization. During this period of change, a new wave of ''[[Russification#Late 1950s to 1980s: Advanced Russianization|sblizheniye]]'' (reapprochment) policy was instituted in order to merge all the peoples of the U.S.S.R. into a new monolithic Soviet nation.\n\nIn the 1960s, the signs of a structural crisis in the Soviet system began to emerge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Azerbaijan's crucial oil industry lost its relative importance in the Soviet economy, partly because of a shift of oil production to other regions of the Soviet Union and partly because of the depletion of known oil resources on land, while offshore production was not deemed cost effective. As a result, Azerbaijan had the lowest rate of growth in productivity and economic output among the Soviet republics, with the exception of [[Tajikistan]]. Ethnic tensions, particularly between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, began to grow, but violence was suppressed.\n\nIn an attempt to end the growing structural crisis, in 1969, the government in Moscow appointed [[Heydar Aliyev]] as the first secretary of the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]]. Aliyev temporarily improved economic conditions and promoted alternative industries to the declining oil industry, such as cotton. He also consolidated the republic's ruling elite, which now consisted almost entirely of ethnic Azeris, thus reverting the previous trends at \"rapprochement\". In 1982, Aliyev was made a member of the Communist Party's Politburo in Moscow, the highest position ever attained by an Azeri in the Soviet Union. In 1987, when ''[[Perestroika]]'' started, he was forced{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} to retire by the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] whose policies Aliyev opposed.\n\n{{Anchor|1985\u20131991}}\n\nThe late 1980s, during the Gorbachev era, were characterized by increasing unrest in the Caucasus, initially over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] issue. A political awakening came in February 1988 with the renewal of the ethnic conflict, which centered on Armenian demands for the unification of [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of Azerbaijan SSR\nArmenia by March 1988, while pogroms of the Armenian population in Baku and [[Sumgait]] took place. Russia forced enforced military rule on several occasions but unrest continued to spread.\n\nThe ethnic strife revealed the shortcomings of the Communist Party as a champion of national interests, and, in the spirit of ''[[glasnost]]'', independent publications and political organizations began to emerge. Of these organizations, by far the most prominent was the [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]] (PFA),{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} which by the fall of 1989 seemed poised to take power from the Communist Party. The PFA soon experienced a split between a conservative-Islamic wing and a moderate wing. The split was followed by an outbreak of anti-Armenian violence in Baku and intervention by Soviet troops.\n\nUnrest culminated in violent confrontation when [[Black January|Soviet troops killed 132 nationalist demonstrators]] in Baku on January 20, 1990. Azerbaijan declared its independence from the USSR on August 30, 1991, and became part of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. By the end of 1991, [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh]] had escalated into a full-scale war, which culminated into a tense cease-fire that has persisted into the 21st century. Although a cease-fire was achieved, the refusal to negotiate by both sides resulted in a stalemate as Armenian troops retained their positions in Karabakh as well as corridors taken from Azerbaijan that connect the enclave to Armenia.\n\n== Independent Azerbaijan ==\n{{Main|Politics of Azerbaijan}}\n\n=== Mutalibov presidency (1991\u20131992) ===\nWhile during 1990\u20131991 Azerbaijan gave more sacrifices in a struggle for independence from the USSR than any other Soviet republic,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} the declaration of independence introduced by President [[Ayaz Mutalibov]] on August 30, 1991 followed the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]].\nM\u00fctallibov becomes the only Soviet leader besides [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] to endorse the Soviet coup attempt by issuing a statement from Tehran, while later dissolving the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]] and proposing constitutional changes for direct nationwide elections of the president.\n\nOn September 8, 1991, the [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1991|first nationwide presidential elections]], in which Mutalibov was the only running candidate, were held in Azerbaijan. While the elections were neither free nor fair by international standards, Mutalibov formally became the elected president of Azerbaijan. The adoption of the [[declaration of independence]] by the [[Supreme Soviet]] of [[Azerbaijan SSR]] on October 18, 1991, was followed by a dissolution of the [[Azerbaijani Communist Party]]. However, its former members, including President [[Ayaz Mutalibov]], retained their political posts.\n\nIn December 1991 in a nationwide referendum, Azerbaijani voters approved the Declaration of Independence adopted by the Supreme Council; with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan is recognized as independent state at first by [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Romania]] and [[Pakistan]]. The [[United States]] followed suit on December 25.\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict over [[Nagorno Karabakh]] continued despite the efforts to negotiate a settlement. Early in 1992, Karabakh's Armenian leadership proclaimed an independent republic. In what was now a full-scale war between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the Armenians gained the upper hand, with covert assistance from the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]]. Major atrocities were committed by both sides, with the [[Khojaly massacre]] of Azerbaijani civilians on February 25, 1992 causing a social uproar over the government inaction (also was the Maragha Massacre, in which Azeris killed indigenous Armenian civilians). M\u00fctallibov was forced to submit his resignation to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan on March 6, under pressure from the [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]].\n\nMutalibov's failure to build up an adequate army, that he feared may not remain under his control, brought about the downfall of his government. On May 6 the last Azerbaijani-populated town in Nagorno-Karabakh, [[Shusha]], falls under Armenian control. On May 14 the [[Supreme Council of Azerbaijan]] hears the case on the [[Khojaly Massacre]], relieves M\u00fctallibov of any responsibility, reverses his prior resignation and restores him as the President of Azerbaijan, but the day after, May 15, armed forces led by the [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]] take control of the offices of the [[Parliament of Azerbaijan]] and [[Azerbaijani State Radio]] and [[Television in Azerbaijan#State-owned|Television]], thereby deposing M\u00fctallibov, who leaves for Moscow; the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan is dissolved passing the duties to the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]] formed by equal representation of Azerbaijan Popular Front and former communists. Two days later, while Armenian forces take control of Lachin, [[Isa Gambar]] is elected as the new Chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan and takes on the temporary duties of President of Azerbaijan until the national elections due on June 17, 1992.\n\n===Elchibey presidency (1992\u20131993)===\nThe former Communists failed to present a viable candidate at the [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1992|1992 elections]] and [[Abulfaz Elchibey]], the leader of the [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]] (PFA) and former dissident and political prisoner, was elected president with more than 60% of the vote. His program included opposition to Azerbaijan's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], closer relations with [[Turkey]], and a desire for extended links with the [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]].\n\n[[Heydar Aliyev]], who had been prevented from running for president by an age limit of 65, was doing well in [[Nakhichevan District|Nakhichevan]]. He had to contend with an Armenian blockade of Nakhichevan. In turn, Armenia suffered when Azerbaijan halted all rail traffic into and out of Armenia, cutting most of its land links with the outside world. The negative economic effects of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict]] seemed to illustrate the interdependence of the [[Transcaucasian]] nations.\n\nWithin a year after his election, President Elchibey came to face the same situation that had led to the downfall of Mutalibov. The fighting in and around [[Nagorno Karabakh]] steadily turned in favor of the Armenians, who seized around one fifth of Azerbaijan's territory, creating more than a million [[internally displaced persons]]. A military rebellion against Abulfaz Elchibey broke out in early June 1993 in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] under the leadership of Colonel [[Surat Huseynov]]. The [[Popular Front of Azerbaijan]] leadership found itself without political support as a result of the war's setbacks, a steadily deteriorating economy, and opposition from groups led by [[Heydar Aliyev]]. In Baku, Aliyev seized the reins of power and quickly consolidated his position. A [[Azerbaijani vote of confidence referendum, 1993|confidence referendum in August]] deprived Elchibey of his post.\n\n=== Heydar Aliyev presidency (1993\u20132003) ===\n[[File:Heydar Aliyev 1997.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Former Azerbaijani President [[Heydar Aliyev]] was the first Azeri member of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]].]]\n\n[[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1993|On 3 October 1993 a presidential election]] was held, and Aliyev won overwhelmingly.\nBy March 1994, Aliyev was able to get rid of some of his opposition including [[Surat Huseynov]], who was arrested along with other rivals. In 1995, the former military police [[1995 Azeri coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|were accused of plotting a coup and disbanded]]. Coup plotters were linked to [[Nationalist Movement Party|right wing Turkish nationalists]]. Later, in 1996 [[R\u0259sul Quliyev]], former speaker of parliament went into self-imposed exile. Thus, by end of 1996, position of Heydar Aliyev as an ''absolute ruler'' in Azerbaijan was unquestionable.\n\nAs a result of limited reforms and the signing of the so-called \"Contract of The Century\" in October 1994 (over the [[Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] giant oil field) that led to increased oil exports to western markets, the economy began improving. However, extreme levels of [[corruption]] and [[nepotism]] in the state system created by Aliyev prevented Azerbaijan from more sustained development, especially in the non-oil sector.\n\nIn October 1998, Aliev was [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 1998|re-elected as president for a second term]]. Weakened opposition accused him of voter fraud, but no widespread international condemnation of the elections followed. His second term in office was characterized by limited reforms, increasing oil production and the dominance of [[British Petroleum]] as a main foreign oil company in Azerbaijan. In early 1999, a giant [[Shah Deniz gas field]] was discovered making Azerbaijan potentially a major gas exporter. A gas export agreement was signed with [[Turkey]] by 2003. Work on a long-awaited [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline]] started in 2003. The oil pipeline was completed in 2005 and the gas pipeline in 2006. Azerbaijan is also a party to the proposed [[Nabucco Pipeline]].\n\n[[File:Munich Security Conference 2010 - Ilham Aliyev.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ilham Aliyev]]]]\nHeydar Aliyev fell ill and, in April 2003, collapsed on stage and could not return to public life.

The election was characterized by mass violence and was criticised by foreign observers.  Presently, political opposition to the Aliyev administration remains strong.  Many were not satisfied with this new dynastical succession and were pushing for a more democratic government. Ilham Aliyev was [[Azerbaijani presidential election, 2008|re-elected in 2008]] with 87% of the polls, while opposition parties boycotted the elections. In a [[Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum in 2009]], [[term limit]]s for the presidency were abolished and [[freedom of the press]] was restricted.\n\nThe [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]] produced a Parliament completely loyal to Aliyev: for the first time in Azerbaijani history, not a single candidate from the main opposition [[Azerbaijan Popular Front]] or [[Musavat]] parties was elected.\n''[[The Economist]]'' scored [[Azerbaijan]] as an [[authoritarian regime]], placing it 135th out of 167 countries, in its 2010 [[Democracy Index]].\n\n[[2011 Azerbaijani protests|Repeated protests]] were staged against Aliyev's rule in 2011, calling for democratic reforms and the ouster of the government.

and aviator during [[World War II]], best known for his role as an intelligence officer in the [[Doolittle Raid]]. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions as navigator of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|6}} after it was severely damaged and set ablaze by a lone Japanese dive bomber on 19 March 1945. After the war he was the naval air attach\u00e9 in Australia, and during the [[Korean War]], he was the naval liaison officer with the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]]. He retired from the Navy in 1962, he became a professor at [[Stanford University]], [[Santa Clara University]] and the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nStephen Jurika Jr. (pronounced jer-EE-kah) was born in [[Los Angeles, California]],<ref name=\"Obituary\"/> on 9 December 1910, the son of  Stefan Jurika<ref>Stefan Jurika (1880-1929), Anglicised as Stephen Jurika, was born in [[Malatin\u00e1]], then in [[Austria-Hungary]], now in Slovakia. He was a naturalised US citizen and settled on [[Mindanao]] where he engaged in commerce.</ref> and Blanche Anna {{nee}} Walker.<ref name=\"Ancestry\" /><ref>Blanche was a volunteer at Emmanuel Cooperative Hospital, [[Tondo, Manila]]. Betrayed in January 1944 by a Japanese agent, Franco Vera Reyes, who had befriended them and won their trust, Blanche, with Dr. Hawthorne Darby, nurse Helen Jonaline Wilk, Methodist pastor [[Samuel Stagg#Mary Litt Boyd Stagg|Mary Litt Boyd Stagg]], and another woman named Sybil were taken by the [[Kempeitai]] to the [[Manila North Cemetery|Cementerio del Norte]] where they were beheaded and buried on 28 or 30 August 1944:[http://www.philippine-scouts.org/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1085282222] \"Blanche was dead, executed in late August, 1944, hands tied behind her, blindfolded and kneeling over a newly-dug trench somewhere in Manila's North Cemetery, killed with over two dozen other civilians accused of various acts of conspiracy by the Japanese. For Blanche and the few other American women, death was by beheading by Samurai sword. For the men, it had been a single shot to the back of the head.\" \u2014Louis Jurika \n[http://corregidor.org/crypto/intel_01/A%20Philippine%20Odyssey%20-%20Louis%20Jurika.pdf] \nTheir common grave was found in 1945 by Thomas Walker Jurika who threatened and forced the double-agent [[Richard Sakakida]] to reluctantly reveal the grave's location.[http://corregidor.org/crypto/intel_01/sakakida_01.htm]</ref> Stephen had a brother, Thomas Walker Jurika (guerrilla assistant of [[Chick Parsons]]), and a sister, Katrushka (wife of [[Chick Parsons]]).<ref name=\"Obituary\"/> Stephen spent much of his early years in the Philippines, where his father owned plantations, and went to school in the Philippines, China and Japan. He entered the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], graduating with the class of 1933.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\nAfter service on the [[cruiser]]s {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}} and {{USS|Houston|CA-30|2}}, he became a [[naval aviator]], completing his flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. He was then posted to Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3), on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}.<ref name=\"Biography\" /> He married Lillian Ursula Marie Smith, the daughter of a [[United States Marine Corps]] colonel, Harry Locke Smith.<ref name=\"Letters\" /> They had three daughters, Lillian, Jane and Anne.<ref name=\"Obituary\"/>\n\nIn June 1939, he became the naval air [[attach\u00e9]] in Tokyo, a role in which his ability to speak fluent Japanese was invaluable.<ref name=\"Biography\" />  \"As an aviator\", he later recalled, \"I was interested in more than just ships. I became interested in targets.\"<ref name=\"Doolittle Raid\" />  He returned to the United States in August 1941, taking up a posting with the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] in [[Washington, DC]].<ref name=\"Biography\" />\n\n==World War II==\nIn October 1941, Jurika joined the crew of the newly commissioned aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} as its Flight Deck and Intelligence Officer.<ref name=\"Biography\" /> He briefed the participants in the April 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]]<ref>[http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/the-unsolved-mysteries-of-the-doolittle-raid/]</ref> on the best industrial and military targets in the city, and the best routes to get to them, and instructed them on how to identify themselves to people in China.<ref name=\"USS Hornet\" /> He would later be portrayed by [[Leon Ames]] in the 1944 movie about the raid, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]''.<ref name=\"Another bio\" />\n\nJurika served on the ''Hornet'' in the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942,<ref name=\"Oral History\" /> and at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] in October, during which the ''Hornet'' was badly damaged and had to be scuttled.<ref name=\"Biography\" /> In December he became the Operations Officer of [[AirSols]].

During the [[Korean War]], he was the naval liaison officer with the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]], for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit. His citation read:\n\n{{quote|Utilizing his extensive knowledge of naval procedures and operations, Captain Jurika supervised the development and implementation of improved joint operating procedures betn Japan Air Defense Force and Naval Units within the Far East which markedly increased defense capabilities in the theater. Operating under these procedures, the combined activities of Air Force Units and Naval radar units and aircraft produced an exceptionally secure and coordinated air defense program. The outstanding resourcefulness and sound judgment Captain Jurika applied to the communications phase of these plans resulted in closer co-ordination and increased effectiveness of the different units. A short-tour inter-service exchange plan he devised for Air Force and Naval officers contributed greatly to effective joint operations; and through his diligent efforts and exemplary conduct, he was instrumental in bringing about an outstanding level of co-operative effort between the two services.<ref name=\"Military Times\" />  }}\n\n==Later life==\nAfter service on the staffs of Admirals [[Arthur W.

Attempts to reform the sector have traditionally faced strong political and social resistance in Mexico, where subsidies for residential consumers absorb substantial fiscal resources.\n\nThe electricity sector in Mexico relies heavily on thermal sources (75% of total installed capacity), followed by hydropower generation (19%). Although exploitation of solar, wind, and biomass resources has a large potential, geothermal energy is the only renewable source (excluding hydropower) with a significant contribution to the [[energy mix]] (2% of total generation capacity). Expansion plans for the period 2006-2015 estimate the addition of some 14.8 GW of new generation capacity by the public sector, with a predominance of combined cycles.\n\n== Electricity Supply and Demand ==\n\n=== Installed capacity ===\nInstalled electricity capacity in 2008 was 58 GW. Of the installed capacity, 75.3% is thermal, 19% hydro, 2.4% nuclear (the single nuclear power plant [[Laguna Verde nuclear power plant|Laguna Verde]]) and 3.3% renewable other than hydro.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> The general trend in thermal generation is a decline in petroleum-based fuels and a growth in natural gas and coal. Since Mexico is a net importer of natural gas, higher levels of natural gas consumption (i.e. for power generation) will likely depend upon higher imports from either the United States or via liquefied natural gas (LNG).<ref name=\"EIA\">[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Mexico/Background.html EIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017211140/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Mexico/Background.html |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGross generation was 234 TWh that same year (not including cogeneration and autogeneration), with 79.2% coming from conventional thermal sources, 16.6% from hydroelectricity, 4.2% from nuclear power and 3% from geothermal sources.<ref name=\"SENER Statistics\">[http://www.sener.gob.mx/webSener/portal/index.jsp?id=71 SENER Statistics]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion program contemplated by SENER for the period 2008-2017 includes the addition of 14,794 MW by the public service: 14,033 MW by CFE and 761 MW by LFC (''Luz y Fuerza del Centro''). Self-supply and cogeneration will add another 2,490 MW in new capacity. Total public installed capacity in 2017 is estimated at 61,074 MW, 40% and 21% of which would be combined-cycles and hydroelectric plants respectively.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> However, the deactivation of LFC on October 10, 2009, is likely to change this figure.\n\nIn 2009, 4,000 MW were already compromised (i.e. with secured financing).

These connections have primarily been used to import and export electricity during emergencies.<ref name=\"SENER_2006_Pro\"/> In 2007, Mexico exported 1.3 TWh of electricity to the United States, while importing 0.6 TWh.<ref name=\"EIA\"/>\n\nCompanies have built power plants near the United States - Mexico border with the aim of exporting generation to the United States. There are also plans to connect Mexico with [[Guatemala]] and Belize as part of the [[SIEPAC|Central American Interconnection System]].<ref name=\"EIA\"/> The 400 kV interconnection line Mexico - Guatemala was commissioned in April 2009 and has an estimated transmission capacity of 200 MW from Mexico to Guatemala and 70 MW in the opposite direction.<ref>[http://www.investinguatemala.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=111&Itemid=295 Invest in Guatemala, April 28, 2009]</ref>\n\nCFE is not a part of the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], though its transmission system in northern [[Baja California]] is part of the [[Western Electricity Coordinating Council]], and it also has a few other interconnections across the border with the United States.\n\n=== Demand ===\n\nConsumption of electricity in 2008 was 184 TWh, which corresponds to 1,655 kWh per capita.

It is estimated that both reserve margins will remain high during the 2009-2013 period. However, from 2014, the RM is expected to decrease to 29.2%, with the ORM reaching an 8.3%. Those values would be about 25% and 6% respectively in 2017. The commissioning of the Agua Prieta II, Norte II, Norte III, Noreste and Valle de Mexico II and III is essential to avoid power deficits in the northern and central parts of the country. However, irrespective of the reserve margins in the SIN, there are restrictions in transmission capacity that generate bottlenecks or the need to import power.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n== Access to electricity ==\n\nTotal electricity coverage in Mexico is 98.7% (2015).<ref name=\"Encuesta Intercensal 2015\"/> With 99.7% coverage in urban areas with more than 100,000 inhabitants; 99.3% in locales with 15,000-99,999 inhabitants; 98.8% in areas with 2,500-14,999 inhabitants and 96.1% in locales with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Encuesta Intercensal 2015\"/>\n\n== Service Quality ==\n\n=== Interruption frequency and duration ===\n\nIn 2008, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 2.3 for CFE and 4.2 for LFC.

This potential has been estimated at 1,395 MW by CFE, although this figure is likely to be much higher. It ranks third in [[geothermal power]] production worldwide. In 2009, geothermal installed capacity was 964.5 MW and total production was 7.1 TWh. There are four geothermal fields under exploitation: Cerro Prieto, Los Azufres, Los Humeros and Las Tres V\u00edrgenes.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_RE\"/>\n[[Image:LasTresVirgenes06.jpg|thumb|right|250px|El Virgen]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"| PROJECT\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"| MUNICIPALITY\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"| ENTITY\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"| NUMBER OF UNITS\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"| NET CAPACITY (MW)\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"| GROSS GENERATION (GWh)\n|-\n| [[Cerro Prieto]]\n| [[Mexicali]]\n| Baja California\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|720\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5,176\n|-\n| [[Tres Virgenes]]\n| [[Muleg\u00e9]]\n| Baja California Sur\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n|-\n| Azufres\n| Cd.

It is estimated that, taking into account agricultural and forest waste with energy potential and solid urban waste from the ten main cities, the country has a potential capacity of 803 MW and could generate 4,507 MWh per year. In the sugarcane industry, the estimated power generation protential from bagasse is over 3,000 MWh per year.<ref name=\"SENER_GTZ_2006\"/><ref name=\"SENER_2009_RE\"/>\n\n== History of the electricity sector ==\n\n=== 20th Century===\n\nThe electricity sector in Mexico underwent its first serious process of reorganizations during the 1930s, under the mandate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). The National Electricity Code was created and the [[Federal Electricity Commission]] (CFE), a newly create state-owned and state-financed enterprise, came to dominate all investment in new capacity. In 1960, a constitutional amendment [[nationalization|nationalized]] the electricity industry and formally gave the government exclusive \"responsibility\" for generating, transmitting, transforming, and distributing electricity. During this decade, the government also created ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda de la Luz y Fuerza del Centro'' (LFC) to supply electricity to [[Mexico City]] and the neighboring states.\n\nDuring the 1960s and the 1970s, Mexico alienated private investment and decided to prevent market forces from entering the power system. In addition, the surge in [[1970s energy crisis|oil prices of the 1970s]] provided a windfall to [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|oil-rich Mexico]], which allowed the country to maintain substantial [[subsidies]] for electricity generation. Only during the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the Mexican government implemented market [[economic reform|reform]]s in several economic sectors, including electricity.<ref name=\"Carreon_Jimenez_2003\"/>\n\nIn 1992, president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]] reformed the electricity law, establishing that private electricity production was not a [[public service]]. This modification, which allowed for private participation in generation, was debated as [[unconstitutional]] for a long time; in fact in 2002 the Mexican [[National Supreme Court of Justice|Supreme Court]] ruled that it ''may have been'' unconstitutional.<ref>[http://www.iaee.org/documents/The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20Energy%20Reform%20in%20Mexico%20David%20G.%20Victor%20Victor%20G.%20Carreon%20Armando%20Jimenez.pdf Stanford] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407034555/http://www.iaee.org/documents/The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20Energy%20Reform%20in%20Mexico%20David%20G.%20Victor%20Victor%20G.%20Carreon%20Armando%20Jimenez.pdf |date=April 7, 2004 }}</ref> The Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) was created in 1993 as an autonomous agency in charge of regulating the natural gas and electricity industries.<ref name=\"Carreon_Jimenez_2003\"/> However, its functions were only related to private power producers (e.g. award of permits, arbitration, tariff studies) and did not cover CFE and LFC. In this period the CRE's functions were mainly focused on the [[natural gas|gas sector]] and not on electricity.\n\n=== Reform attempts 1990s and 2000s===\n\nAttempts by president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] in the late 1990s, by the  [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN) in 2000, and president [[Vicente Fox]] to carry out a comprehensive reform of the electricity sector in Mexico faced strong political resistance. In 1999, President Zedillo sent an ambitious bill to Congress requesting a change of the [[Constitution]] and allowing for the unbundling of the sector, including the creation of distribution companies under 3-year concessions. Existing power plants would also be sold, except for nuclear and hydro power plants. In 2001, President Fox issued a reform decree that would allow independent power producers to sell directly to industrial customers and would also allow the sale of private power to CFE under long-term contracts without [[procurement|competitive bidding]]. Among other issues, the decree also specified that electricity is not a public service of general interest but a commercial service. Both reform attempts failed, opposed on grounds that the electricity and, more broadly, the energy sector is strategic for national sovereignty.<ref name=\"Carreon_Jimenez_2003\"/> As required by the Constitution, the electricity sector remained federally owned, with the [[Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad|CFE]] essentially controlling the whole sector.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nAmong the different proposals for the reform of the electricity sector, the main ones are the creation of the CFE's Fundamental Law and the modification of this firm's operations and the extension of Electricity Regulatory Commission's (CRE) competencies. Also important is the promotion of private independent power production and the discussion of the role played by Pidiregas (see Financing below) in the financing of large projects.\n\n=== Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency laws 2008 ===\n\nDuring the term of president [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]], on 28 November 2008 two decrees published in the [[Official Journal of the Federation]] created two laws, one addressing [[renewable energy]] and the other [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]].<ref name=\"LAERFTE\">{{cite law |author=C\u00e1mara de Diputados del Honorable Congreso de la Uni\u00f3n |date={{date|2008-11-28}} |title=DECRETO por el que se expide la Ley para el Aprovechamiento de Energ\u00edas Renovables y el Financiamiento de la Transici\u00f3n Energ\u00e9tica (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda)|number=DOF: 28/11/2008 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2008&month=11&day=28}}</ref><ref name=\"LASE\">{{cite law |author=C\u00e1mara de Diputados del Honorable Congreso de la Uni\u00f3n |date={{date|2008-11-28}} |title=DECRETO por el que se expide la Ley para el Aprovechamiento Sustentable de la Energ\u00eda (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda)|number=DOF: 28/11/2008 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2008&month=11&day=28}}</ref>\n\nThe Renewable Energy Development and Energy Transition Financing Law (LAERFTE) mandated the Secretary of Energy (SENER) to produce a Special Program for Development of Renewable Energy (PEAER), and a National Strategy for Energy Transition and Sustainable Energy Use (ENTEASE), to be updated yearly. The main objective of the law is to regulate the use of renewable energy resources and clean technology, as well as to establish financing instruments to allow Mexico to scale-up electricity generation based on renewable resources. SENER and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) are responsible for defining those mechanisms and establishing legal instruments.\n\nThe following functions are the responsibility of SENER, among others:<ref name=\"LAERFTE\"/> (a) defining a national program for ensuring a sustainable energy development both in the short and the longer term, (b) creating and coordinating the necessary instruments to enforce the law, (c) preparing a national renewable energy inventory, (d) establishing a methodology to determine the extent to which renewable energies may contribute to total electricity generation, (e) defining transmission expansion plans to connect power generation from renewable energy to the national grid, and (f) promoting the development of renewable energy projects to increase access in rural areas.\n\nThe CRE is responsible for developing rules and norms regarding the implementation of LAERFTE, including provisions for promotion, production, purchase and exchange of electricity from renewable sources. The CRE, in coordination with the Secretary of Finance (SCHP) and SENER, will determine the price that suppliers will pay to the renewable energy generators. Payments will be based on technology and geographic location. In addition, CRE will set rules for contracting between energy generators and suppliers, obliging the latter to establish long-term contracts from renewable sources.<ref name=\"LAERFTE\"/>\n\nThe Sustainable Energy Use Law (LASE) has as its objective to provide incentives for the sustainable use of energy in all processes and activities related to its exploitation, production, transformation, distribution and consumption, including [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures.<ref name=\"LASE\"/> More specifically, the law proposes:\n* The creation of a National Program for Sustainable Energy Use (PRONASE), which targets energy efficiency promotion in the public sector, as well as research and diffusion of sustainable energy use.\n* The establishment of the National Commission for Efficient Energy Use (CONUEE) as a decentralized body of SENER that (i) will advise the national public administration and (ii) promote the implementation of best practices related to energy efficiency. This entity replaced the National Commission for Energy Saving (CONAE), which had been the leading government energy efficiency body.\n* The creation of an Advisory Committee for Sustainable Energy Use (CCASE) as part of the CONUEE to evaluate the compliance of objectives, strategies, actions and goals of the program, consisting of the Energy Minister (SENER) and six academic researchers with extensive experience in the field.\n* The creation of the National Subsystem of Information for Energy Use to register, organize, update and disseminate information about (i) energy consumption, its end-uses in distinct industries and geographical regions of the country, (ii) factors that impel these uses, and (iii) indicators of energy efficiency.\n\nIn this context, the Government carries the following specific activities: (i) a program aimed at replacing [[incandescent bulb]]s (IBs) with [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) in the residential sector, (ii) an appliances replacement program, (iii) the modernization of the public transport system for long distances and surroundings, (iv) a program for energy efficiency in municipalities, (v) industrial and commercial energy efficiency programs, (vi) supply side energy efficiency in the electricity sector, and (vii) energy efficiency in the national oil company, [[PEMEX]].\n\n=== Takeover of ''Luz y Fuerza del Centro'' 2009 ===\n\nOn 12 October 2009, the police seized the offices of the state-owned ''Luz y Fuerza del Centro'', dissolving the company, laying off the workers, and putting its operations, which supply power to 25 million Mexicans, under the control of the [[Comision Federal de Electricidad|CFE]].<ref name=\"LYF\">{{cite news|author=Jos\u00e9 C\u00f3rdoba |title=Mexico power takeover creates sparks |date={{date|2009-10-12}} |publisher=Wall Street Journal |location=Mexico City |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125530734212079359?mod=googlenews_wsj |accessdate={{date|2016-10-11}}}}</ref> According to the government, spending at the company was increasingly outpacing sales.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |title=Mexico shuts down troubled energy firm |date={{date|2009-10-12}} |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8301986.stm |accessdate={{date|2016-10-11}}}}</ref>\n\n===Reforms from 2013 onwards===\n[[File:EPN.

The reform was approved by the [[Senate]] on 11 December of that year, and by the [[Chamber of Deputies]] one day later. On 18 December the reform was declared [[constitutionality|constitutional]], and it was signed into effect on 20 December by its publication in the [[Official Journal of the Federation]].<ref name=\"DOF_2013_RE\">{{cite law|title= DECRETO por el que se reforman y adicionan diversas disposiciones de la Constituci\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, en Materia de Energ\u00eda (Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n) |date={{date|2013-12-20}} |number=DOF: 20/12/2013 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2013&month=12&day=20}}</ref><ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\"/> The initiative proposed that Article 27 of the [[Constitution of Mexico]] returned to the wording that it had in 1938 when president [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] made a first reform, which affirmed that the natural resources belong exclusively to the nation, but allowed the participation of private enterprises in the extraction and handling of these resources on behalf of the state. In 1960 a protectionist reform had made it impossible for any private company to participate in the energy sector, so the 2013 decree restored Article 27 to its previous state and included a similar provision for developing the electrical sector: a market for electricity generation would be established in which private entities could participate, but the control, transmission and distribution would remain an exclusive task of the state as a [[public service]].\n\nBy the end of 2014, several decrees transformed the Mexican national electric sector. On 11 August 2014 the following laws were published:<ref name=\"LIE_2014\">{{cite law|title=DECRETO por el que se expiden la Ley de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica, la Ley de Energ\u00eda Geot\u00e9rmica y se adicionan y reforman diversas disposiciones de la Ley de Aguas Nacionales (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda) |date={{date|2014-08-11}} |number=DOF: 11/08/2014 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2014&month=08&day=11}}</ref><ref name=\"LCFE_2014\">{{cite law|title=DECRETO por el que se expiden la Ley de Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos y la Ley de la Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad, y se reforman y derogan diversas disposiciones de la Ley Federal de las Entidades Paraestatales; la Ley de Adquisiciones, Arrendamientos y Servicios del Sector P\u00fablico y la Ley de Obras P\u00fablicas y Servicios Relacionados con las Mismas (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda)| date={{date|2014-08-11}} |number=DOF: 11/08/2014 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2014&month=08&day=11}}</ref><ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\"/>\n* Electric Industry Law (LIE). Its objective is to regulate the generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of the electricity, the planning and control of the national electric system (SEN), and the operation of the wholesale electricity marker (MEM). The law gives further attributions to the Secretary of Energy (SENER) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) to execute the energy policies. It also supposes the transfer of certain obligations from the [[Comision Federal de Electricidad|Federal Electricity Commission]] (CFE) to the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE), which becomes independent from CFE, in order to manage the electric system (SEN) and the market (MEM).\n* Federal Electricity Commission Law (LCFE). The firm is established as a \"productive company\" of the state, in order to produce additional value and return of investment through industrial, commercial, or entrepreneurial activities. This contrasts with its previous ordinance in which it only provided electricity as a public service with a fixed [[budget]]. This presumes structural changes in the company, creation of new [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]], resulting in more transparency, better bookkeeping, and increase in operational efficiency.\n* Regulating Institutions in Energy Matters Law. Establishes the collaboration between the most important government bodies, such as SENER and CENACE, in order to implement the energy policies, and recommend changes to them.\n* Other associated laws, such as Geothermic Energy Law, Hydrocarbons Law, [[Pemex]] Law.\n\nDuring this time the SENER published the general rules to obtain and assign [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|clean energy certificates]] (CEL), which are equivalent to 1 [[MWh]] of clean energy, no matter the specific technology. The SENER also mandated that qualified users (big consumers) acquire 5% of their own consumption in CELs for 2018 and 2019.<ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\"/> Furthermore the SENER published simplified rules for interconnection of private generators.<ref name=\"SENER_2015_Pro\"/>\n\nOn 30 June 2015 the government presented the Program for Development of the National Electric System (PRODESEN) which establishes a master plan for the electrical system until 2030.<ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\">{{cite report |title=Programa de desarrollo del sistema el\u00e9ctrico nacional (PRODESEN) 2016-2030 |author=Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda (SENER) |date={{date|2016-05-30}} |language=Spanish |url=http://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/102166/PRODESEN_2016-2030_1.pdf}}</ref> On 8 September 2015 the SENER published the first Rules for the Electricity Market establishing the new rights and obligations for the generators, resellers, and qualified users of the market, to be overseen by the CRE and the CENACE.

For all tariffs, an interagency group composed of CFE (Federal Electricity Commission, or ''Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad''), LFC (Central Light and Power, or ''Luz y Fuerza del Centro''), SHCP (Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, or ''Secretaria de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico''), SENER (Ministry of Energy, or ''Secretaria de Energia''), CRE (Regulatory Commission of Energy, or ''Comisi\u00f3n Reguladora de la Energ\u00eda''), and CNA (National Water Commission, or '' Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua'') meet regularly and once a year they prepare a tariff proposal for the subsequent year. Tariffs are approved by SHCP and not by the energy sector regulator.<ref name=\"ESMAP_Mex_2004\"/>\n\nExcept for the tariff set for the agricultural sector, average electricity prices have followed an upward trend since the year 2002.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> In 2008, average tariffs for the different sectors were:<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n* Residential: US$ 0.106/kWh\n* Commercial: US$ 0.255/kWh\n* Services: US$ 0.172/kWh\n* Agriculture: US$ 0.051/kWh\n* Industrial: medium industry US$ 0.153/kWh, large industry US$ 0.118/kWh\n\nThe average tariff, US$ 0.137/kWh, was 16.5% higher in 2008 when compared to 2007.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n=== Subsidies ===\n\nFor the industrial and commercial sectors, electricity supply is priced on a rational cost basis for large firms. As a result, they receive no government subsidy, while subsidies for small firms are relatively small. On the other hand, agricultural and residential customers have traditionally received large subsidies since the electricity they consume is significantly underpriced. Extensive subsidies have contributed to a rapid growth in demand. In 2000, the average residential tariff covered only 43% of the costs, while the average tariff for agricultural use covered 31%.<ref name=\"WBank_2004_Mex_exp\"/> Total subsidies amounted to 46% of total electricity sales.<ref name=\"ESMAP_Mex_2004\"/> In addition, residential subsidies were mostly captured by medium and high income classes as the amount of the subsidy raised with consumption.<ref name=\"ESMAP_Mex_2004\"/>\n\nIn 2002, a restructuring of residential tariffs significantly raised the infra-marginal tariffs paid by middle and especially high consumers of electricity. Currently, billing schedules vary by temperature, season and consumption level. In spite of this reform, price/cost ratio was still under 40% in 2002, even after the 21% increase in price due to the reform. In addition, the share of subsidies going to the non-poor population remained high, estimated at 64%. Agricultural tariffs were also modified in 2003, when a fixed price per kWh was fixed. These new tariffs sought charging higher prices for excess energy use.<ref name=\"WBank_2004_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nThe low tariffs, together with LFC's inefficiencies, absorb a large amount of fiscal resources. For 2008, it was estimated that the subsidies paid through electricity tariffs to final CFE and LFC consumers by the Federal Government amounted to US$10 billion<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> (close to 1% of GDP).\n\n== Investment and Financing ==\n\n=== Investment by sub-sector ===\n\nNecessary investment to carry out the 2008-2017 expansion plan amounts to [[MXN]] 629,106 million (US$47 billion). The breakdown of the investment is: 41.2% for generation, 21.2% for transmission, 23.9% for distribution, 11.8% for maintenance and 1.9% for other needs.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\nFrom the required total, 33.9% corresponds to OFP (''Obras P\u00fablicas Financiadas'' or Financed Public Works), 8.8% to Independent Power Production, 51.5% to budgeted works and the remaining 5.9% to financial schemes still to be defined.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n=== Financing ===\n\n==== Pidiregas ====\n[[Image:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Oil platform in the Campeche [[Sound (geography)|Sound]]]]\n\nIn 1995-1996 the Mexican government created Pidiregas (\"Proyectos de Inversi\u00f3n Diferida En El Registro del Gasto \" \u2013 Investment Projects with Deferred Expenditure Registration) to finance long-term productive infrastructure projects. Due to budgetary restrictions, the government realized that it could not provide all the resources needed and decided to complement the public sector's efforts with Pidiregas, a deferred financing schedule. This mechanism, which only applied to investments carried out by [[PEMEX]](Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos) and CFE aimed to create the conditions for the penetration of private initiatives in [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and electricity generation.<ref name=\"Diputados\">[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/cedia/sia/se/SIA-DEC-44-2003.pdf ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227032913/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/cedia/sia/se/SIA-DEC-44-2003.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}</ref> Pidiregas have been extended and have also grown in amount ([[PEMEX]] uses them for as much as four times the amount of CFE), although the original motivation for their existence is gone.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nFollowing a [[project finance]] scheme, for a project to be executed under Pidiregas, the resources that it generates from the sale of goods and services have to be enough to cover the incurred financial obligations. Projects are paid with the revenues generated during their operation and require the signature of a contract in which a product or work is involved. The State assumes the risk since PEMEX or CFE sign the contract as guarantee, while the investors recover their investment in the agreed time.<ref name=\"Diputados\"/> As a result, Pidiregas cannot be considered as true private investment since, under true private sector participation, firms would make investment decisions and bear the full risk.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/> The viability of the program has been questioned as its effect in the public budget is similar to the emission of public debt. Furthermore, until 2006, the Pidigeras scheme resulted in losses.<ref name=\"Diputados\"/>\n\n==== Grid extension ====\n\nSince 1995, states and municipalities hold the responsibility for the planning and financing of grid extension and off-grid supply. A large part of the investment is financed through FAIS (Fund to Support Social Infrastructure). The [[National Commission for Indigenous People]] and SEDESOL (Secretariat for Social Development) also finance an important share of grid extension. Once a particular system has been constructed, its assets and operational and financial responsibility are transferred to CFE.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nRecent studies have concluded that interconnecting [[Baja California]] with the National Interconnected System (SIN) would be both a technically and economically sound decision. This interconnection would allow to serve peak demand in the Baja California system with generation resources from the SIN. Conversely, in period of low demand in Baja California, surplus electricity and base load (i.e. geothermal and combined cycles) could be exported to the SIN. As a result, there would be a reduction of investment costs in generation infrastructure and of total production costs. In addition, the interconnection would open new opportunities for electricity exchanges with power utilities in Western United States through the existing transmission links with California. It is expected that the interconnection will be commissioned in 2013.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n==== Renewable energy ====\n\nThe Renewable Energy Law creates a Fund for the Energy Transition and the Sustainable Use of Energy. This fund will assure the financing of projects evaluated and approved by the Technical Committee, chaired by SENER. The fund will begin with US$200 million for each year between 2009 and 2011.\n\n== Summary of private participation in the electricity sector ==\n\nAs required by the Constitution, the electricity sector in Mexico remains federally owned, with the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) essentially controlling the whole sector. Although generation was opened to private participation in 1992, CFE is still the dominant player, with two-thirds of installed capacity.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"|Activity\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"|Private participation (%)\n|-\n| Generation\n| 25% of installed capacity\n|-\n| Transmission\n| 0%\n|-\n| Distribution\n| 0%\n|}\n\n== Electricity and the environment ==\n\n=== Responsibility for the environment ===\n\nThe Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), created in 2000 from the previous Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources and Fishing (also SEMARNAT) holds the responsibilities for the environment in Mexico.\n\nSEMARNAT was one of the government agencies within the Intersectoral Commission for Climate Change that elaborated Mexico's Climate Change Strategy.<ref name=\"Climate_change\">SEMARNAT, Estrategia Nacional de Cambio Clim\u00e1tico [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227032915/http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/Documents/Estrategias_libro_completo_compress2.pdf (ENACC)]</ref>\n\n=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===\n\nAccording to Mexico's Third National Communication to the [[UNFCCC]], the country emitted 643 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) in 2002, of which almost 400 Mt CO2e resulted from the combustion of fossil fuels (over 60 percent of total emissions). The sources of Mexico's GHG emissions are energy generation (24%), transport (18%), forests and land-use change (14%), waste management (10%), manufacturing and construction (8%), industrial processes (8%), agriculture (7%), fugitive emissions (6%), and other uses (5%).<ref name=\"National Communication\">SEMARNAT, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090619213656/http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/queessemarnat/consultaspublicas/Documents/pecc/consultacomplementaria/090323%20PECC%20vcpc.pdf Mexico Third National Communication to the UNFCCC] </ref>\n\n=== Climate change mitigation ===\n\nAlthough the [[Kyoto Protocol]] does not require Mexico to reduce its [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, the country has committed to reduce its emissions voluntarily. In May 2007, President [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n|Calder\u00f3n]] announced the National Climate Change Strategy<ref name=\"Climate_change\"/> which focuses on climate change as a central part of Mexico's national development policy. The ENACC sets the long-term climate change agenda for the country, together with medium to long-term goals for adaptation and mitigation. In December 2008, Mexico announced that it would reduce its GHG emissions by 50% below 2002 levels by 2050.\n\nIn June 2009, the Government of Mexico formally committed itself to a detailed long-term plan for emission reductions embedded in the Special Climate Change Program (PECC)<ref>SEMARNAT, Programa Especial para Cambio Clim\u00e1tico [http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/queessemarnat/consultaspublicas/Documents/pecc/consultacomplementaria/090323%20PECC%20vcpc.pdf (PECC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711025151/http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/queessemarnat/consultaspublicas/Documents/pecc/consultacomplementaria/090323%20PECC%20vcpc.pdf |date=July 11, 2009 }}</ref> that provides an accounting of emissions by sector, creates a framework for monitoring improvements and establishes a legally binding blueprint for emission reduction initiatives, sector by sector. The PECC sets out a four pillar program that includes (i) a long-term vision for government action; (ii) sectoral plans for GHG mitigation; (iii) plans for adaptation; and (iv) cross-cutting policy initiatives.\n\n=== CDM projects in electricity ===\n\nOn September 2009, there are 47 energy-related registered CDM projects in Mexico with a total emission reduction potential of about 3.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent.

Attempts to reform the sector have traditionally faced strong political and social resistance in Mexico, where subsidies for residential consumers absorb substantial fiscal resources.\n\nThe electricity sector in Mexico relies heavily on thermal sources (75% of total installed capacity), followed by hydropower generation (19%). Although exploitation of solar, wind, and biomass resources has a large potential, geothermal energy is the only renewable source (excluding hydropower) with a significant contribution to the [[energy mix]] (2% of total generation capacity). Expansion plans for the period 2006-2015 estimate the addition of some 14.8 GW of new generation capacity by the public sector, with a predominance of combined cycles.\n\n== Electricity Supply and Demand ==\n\n=== Installed capacity ===\nInstalled electricity capacity in 2008 was 58 GW. Of the installed capacity, 75.3% is thermal, 19% hydro, 2.4% nuclear (the single nuclear power plant [[Laguna Verde nuclear power plant|Laguna Verde]]) and 3.3% renewable other than hydro.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> The general trend in thermal generation is a decline in petroleum-based fuels and a growth in natural gas and coal. Since Mexico is a net importer of natural gas, higher levels of natural gas consumption (i.e. for power generation) will likely depend upon higher imports from either the United States or via liquefied natural gas (LNG).<ref name=\"EIA\">[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Mexico/Background.html EIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017211140/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Mexico/Background.html |date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nGross generation was 234 TWh that same year (not including cogeneration and autogeneration), with 79.2% coming from conventional thermal sources, 16.6% from hydroelectricity, 4.2% from nuclear power and 3% from geothermal sources.<ref name=\"SENER Statistics\">[http://www.sener.gob.mx/webSener/portal/index.jsp?id=71 SENER Statistics]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe expansion program contemplated by SENER for the period 2008-2017 includes the addition of 14,794 MW by the public service: 14,033 MW by CFE and 761 MW by LFC (''Luz y Fuerza del Centro''). Self-supply and cogeneration will add another 2,490 MW in new capacity. Total public installed capacity in 2017 is estimated at 61,074 MW, 40% and 21% of which would be combined-cycles and hydroelectric plants respectively.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> However, the deactivation of LFC on October 10, 2009, is likely to change this figure.\n\nIn 2009, 4,000 MW were already compromised (i.e. with secured financing).

These connections have primarily been used to import and export electricity during emergencies.<ref name=\"SENER_2006_Pro\"/> In 2007, Mexico exported 1.3 TWh of electricity to the United States, while importing 0.6 TWh.<ref name=\"EIA\"/>\n\nCompanies have built power plants near the United States - Mexico border with the aim of exporting generation to the United States. There are also plans to connect Mexico with [[Guatemala]] and Belize as part of the [[SIEPAC|Central American Interconnection System]].<ref name=\"EIA\"/> The 400 kV interconnection line Mexico - Guatemala was commissioned in April 2009 and has an estimated transmission capacity of 200 MW from Mexico to Guatemala and 70 MW in the opposite direction.<ref>[http://www.investinguatemala.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=111&Itemid=295 Invest in Guatemala, April 28, 2009]</ref>\n\nCFE is not a part of the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], though its transmission system in northern [[Baja California]] is part of the [[Western Electricity Coordinating Council]], and it also has a few other interconnections across the border with the United States.\n\n=== Demand ===\n\nConsumption of electricity in 2008 was 184 TWh, which corresponds to 1,655 kWh per capita. Consumption share by sector was as follows:<ref name=\"SENER Statistics\"/>\n\n* Residential: 26%\n* Industrial: 59% (38% for mid-sized industry and 21% for large industry)\n* Commercial: 7%\n* Agriculture: 4%\n* Services: 4%\n\n=== Demand and supply projections ===\n\nElectricity demand has grown steadily in the last decade and the Energy Secretariat (SENER) forecasts that consumption will grow by 3.3% a year for the next ten years, reaching 281.5 TWh in 2017.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> Demand growth forecasts have been revised down, from an estimated 4.8% a year in the projections from 2006,<ref name=\"SENER_2006_Pro\"/> due to the expected effects of the economic crisis on energy demand.\n\n=== Reserve margin ===\n\nIn 2008, the reserve margin (RM) in the National Interconnected System (SIN) was 45.8%, while the operating reserve margin (ORM) was 21.3%. It is estimated that both reserve margins will remain high during the 2009-2013 period. However, from 2014, the RM is expected to decrease to 29.2%, with the ORM reaching an 8.3%. Those values would be about 25% and 6% respectively in 2017. The commissioning of the Agua Prieta II, Norte II, Norte III, Noreste and Valle de Mexico II and III is essential to avoid power deficits in the northern and central parts of the country. However, irrespective of the reserve margins in the SIN, there are restrictions in transmission capacity that generate bottlenecks or the need to import power.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n== Access to electricity ==\n\nTotal electricity coverage in Mexico is 98.7% (2015).<ref name=\"Encuesta Intercensal 2015\"/> With 99.7% coverage in urban areas with more than 100,000 inhabitants; 99.3% in locales with 15,000-99,999 inhabitants; 98.8% in areas with 2,500-14,999 inhabitants and 96.1% in locales with fewer than 2,500 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Encuesta Intercensal 2015\"/>\n\n== Service Quality ==\n\n=== Interruption frequency and duration ===\n\nIn 2008, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 2.3 for CFE and 4.2 for LFC.

However, the ''Comisi\u00f3n Federal de la Electricidad'' (CFE), the state-owned utility, is still the dominant player in the generation sector, with two-thirds of installed capacity. As of the end of 2008, private generators held about 23 GW of generation capacity, mostly consisting of combined-cycle, gas-fired turbines (CCGFT).<ref name=\"EIA\"/> Private generators have to sell all their output to CFE since they are not allowed to sell directly to users. There is indeed a commercialization monopoly controlled by CFE.\n\nIn the period between 1997 and 2009, CRE has awarded 22 permits for Independent Power Producers (IPP), for a total of 13 GW.

It is estimated that, taking into account agricultural and forest waste with energy potential and solid urban waste from the ten main cities, the country has a potential capacity of 803 MW and could generate 4,507 MWh per year. In the sugarcane industry, the estimated power generation protential from bagasse is over 3,000 MWh per year.<ref name=\"SENER_GTZ_2006\"/><ref name=\"SENER_2009_RE\"/>\n\n== History of the electricity sector ==\n\n=== 20th Century===\n\nThe electricity sector in Mexico underwent its first serious process of reorganizations during the 1930s, under the mandate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). The National Electricity Code was created and the [[Federal Electricity Commission]] (CFE), a newly create state-owned and state-financed enterprise, came to dominate all investment in new capacity. In 1960, a constitutional amendment [[nationalization|nationalized]] the electricity industry and formally gave the government exclusive \"responsibility\" for generating, transmitting, transforming, and distributing electricity. During this decade, the government also created ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda de la Luz y Fuerza del Centro'' (LFC) to supply electricity to [[Mexico City]] and the neighboring states.\n\nDuring the 1960s and the 1970s, Mexico alienated private investment and decided to prevent market forces from entering the power system. In addition, the surge in [[1970s energy crisis|oil prices of the 1970s]] provided a windfall to [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|oil-rich Mexico]], which allowed the country to maintain substantial [[subsidies]] for electricity generation. Only during the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the Mexican government implemented market [[economic reform|reform]]s in several economic sectors, including electricity.<ref name=\"Carreon_Jimenez_2003\"/>\n\nIn 1992, president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]] reformed the electricity law, establishing that private electricity production was not a [[public service]]. This modification, which allowed for private participation in generation, was debated as [[unconstitutional]] for a long time; in fact in 2002 the Mexican [[National Supreme Court of Justice|Supreme Court]] ruled that it ''may have been'' unconstitutional.<ref>[http://www.iaee.org/documents/The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20Energy%20Reform%20in%20Mexico%20David%20G.%20Victor%20Victor%20G.%20Carreon%20Armando%20Jimenez.pdf Stanford] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407034555/http://www.iaee.org/documents/The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20Energy%20Reform%20in%20Mexico%20David%20G.%20Victor%20Victor%20G.%20Carreon%20Armando%20Jimenez.pdf |date=April 7, 2004 }}</ref> The Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) was created in 1993 as an autonomous agency in charge of regulating the natural gas and electricity industries.<ref name=\"Carreon_Jimenez_2003\"/> However, its functions were only related to private power producers (e.g. award of permits, arbitration, tariff studies) and did not cover CFE and LFC. In this period the CRE's functions were mainly focused on the [[natural gas|gas sector]] and not on electricity.\n\n=== Reform attempts 1990s and 2000s===\n\nAttempts by president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] in the late 1990s, by the  [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN) in 2000, and president [[Vicente Fox]] to carry out a comprehensive reform of the electricity sector in Mexico faced strong political resistance. In 1999, President Zedillo sent an ambitious bill to Congress requesting a change of the [[Constitution]] and allowing for the unbundling of the sector, including the creation of distribution companies under 3-year concessions. Existing power plants would also be sold, except for nuclear and hydro power plants. In 2001, President Fox issued a reform decree that would allow independent power producers to sell directly to industrial customers and would also allow the sale of private power to CFE under long-term contracts without [[procurement|competitive bidding]]. Among other issues, the decree also specified that electricity is not a public service of general interest but a commercial service. Both reform attempts failed, opposed on grounds that the electricity and, more broadly, the energy sector is strategic for national sovereignty.<ref name=\"Carreon_Jimenez_2003\"/> As required by the Constitution, the electricity sector remained federally owned, with the [[Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad|CFE]] essentially controlling the whole sector.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nAmong the different proposals for the reform of the electricity sector, the main ones are the creation of the CFE's Fundamental Law and the modification of this firm's operations and the extension of Electricity Regulatory Commission's (CRE) competencies. Also important is the promotion of private independent power production and the discussion of the role played by Pidiregas (see Financing below) in the financing of large projects.\n\n=== Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency laws 2008 ===\n\nDuring the term of president [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n]], on 28 November 2008 two decrees published in the [[Official Journal of the Federation]] created two laws, one addressing [[renewable energy]] and the other [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]].<ref name=\"LAERFTE\">{{cite law |author=C\u00e1mara de Diputados del Honorable Congreso de la Uni\u00f3n |date={{date|2008-11-28}} |title=DECRETO por el que se expide la Ley para el Aprovechamiento de Energ\u00edas Renovables y el Financiamiento de la Transici\u00f3n Energ\u00e9tica (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda)|number=DOF: 28/11/2008 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2008&month=11&day=28}}</ref><ref name=\"LASE\">{{cite law |author=C\u00e1mara de Diputados del Honorable Congreso de la Uni\u00f3n |date={{date|2008-11-28}} |title=DECRETO por el que se expide la Ley para el Aprovechamiento Sustentable de la Energ\u00eda (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda)|number=DOF: 28/11/2008 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2008&month=11&day=28}}</ref>\n\nThe Renewable Energy Development and Energy Transition Financing Law (LAERFTE) mandated the Secretary of Energy (SENER) to produce a Special Program for Development of Renewable Energy (PEAER), and a National Strategy for Energy Transition and Sustainable Energy Use (ENTEASE), to be updated yearly. The main objective of the law is to regulate the use of renewable energy resources and clean technology, as well as to establish financing instruments to allow Mexico to scale-up electricity generation based on renewable resources. SENER and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) are responsible for defining those mechanisms and establishing legal instruments.\n\nThe following functions are the responsibility of SENER, among others:<ref name=\"LAERFTE\"/> (a) defining a national program for ensuring a sustainable energy development both in the short and the longer term, (b) creating and coordinating the necessary instruments to enforce the law, (c) preparing a national renewable energy inventory, (d) establishing a methodology to determine the extent to which renewable energies may contribute to total electricity generation, (e) defining transmission expansion plans to connect power generation from renewable energy to the national grid, and (f) promoting the development of renewable energy projects to increase access in rural areas.\n\nThe CRE is responsible for developing rules and norms regarding the implementation of LAERFTE, including provisions for promotion, production, purchase and exchange of electricity from renewable sources. The CRE, in coordination with the Secretary of Finance (SCHP) and SENER, will determine the price that suppliers will pay to the renewable energy generators. Payments will be based on technology and geographic location. In addition, CRE will set rules for contracting between energy generators and suppliers, obliging the latter to establish long-term contracts from renewable sources.<ref name=\"LAERFTE\"/>\n\nThe Sustainable Energy Use Law (LASE) has as its objective to provide incentives for the sustainable use of energy in all processes and activities related to its exploitation, production, transformation, distribution and consumption, including [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures.<ref name=\"LASE\"/> More specifically, the law proposes:\n* The creation of a National Program for Sustainable Energy Use (PRONASE), which targets energy efficiency promotion in the public sector, as well as research and diffusion of sustainable energy use.\n* The establishment of the National Commission for Efficient Energy Use (CONUEE) as a decentralized body of SENER that (i) will advise the national public administration and (ii) promote the implementation of best practices related to energy efficiency. This entity replaced the National Commission for Energy Saving (CONAE), which had been the leading government energy efficiency body.\n* The creation of an Advisory Committee for Sustainable Energy Use (CCASE) as part of the CONUEE to evaluate the compliance of objectives, strategies, actions and goals of the program, consisting of the Energy Minister (SENER) and six academic researchers with extensive experience in the field.\n* The creation of the National Subsystem of Information for Energy Use to register, organize, update and disseminate information about (i) energy consumption, its end-uses in distinct industries and geographical regions of the country, (ii) factors that impel these uses, and (iii) indicators of energy efficiency.\n\nIn this context, the Government carries the following specific activities: (i) a program aimed at replacing [[incandescent bulb]]s (IBs) with [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) in the residential sector, (ii) an appliances replacement program, (iii) the modernization of the public transport system for long distances and surroundings, (iv) a program for energy efficiency in municipalities, (v) industrial and commercial energy efficiency programs, (vi) supply side energy efficiency in the electricity sector, and (vii) energy efficiency in the national oil company, [[PEMEX]].\n\n=== Takeover of ''Luz y Fuerza del Centro'' 2009 ===\n\nOn 12 October 2009, the police seized the offices of the state-owned ''Luz y Fuerza del Centro'', dissolving the company, laying off the workers, and putting its operations, which supply power to 25 million Mexicans, under the control of the [[Comision Federal de Electricidad|CFE]].<ref name=\"LYF\">{{cite news|author=Jos\u00e9 C\u00f3rdoba |title=Mexico power takeover creates sparks |date={{date|2009-10-12}} |publisher=Wall Street Journal |location=Mexico City |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125530734212079359?mod=googlenews_wsj |accessdate={{date|2016-10-11}}}}</ref> According to the government, spending at the company was increasingly outpacing sales.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |title=Mexico shuts down troubled energy firm |date={{date|2009-10-12}} |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8301986.stm |accessdate={{date|2016-10-11}}}}</ref>\n\n===Reforms from 2013 onwards===\n[[File:EPN.

The reform was approved by the [[Senate]] on 11 December of that year, and by the [[Chamber of Deputies]] one day later.

In 1960 a protectionist reform had made it impossible for any private company to participate in the energy sector, so the 2013 decree restored Article 27 to its previous state and included a similar provision for developing the electrical sector: a market for electricity generation would be established in which private entities could participate, but the control, transmission and distribution would remain an exclusive task of the state as a [[public service]].\n\nBy the end of 2014, several decrees transformed the Mexican national electric sector. On 11 August 2014 the following laws were published:<ref name=\"LIE_2014\">{{cite law|title=DECRETO por el que se expiden la Ley de la Industria El\u00e9ctrica, la Ley de Energ\u00eda Geot\u00e9rmica y se adicionan y reforman diversas disposiciones de la Ley de Aguas Nacionales (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda) |date={{date|2014-08-11}} |number=DOF: 11/08/2014 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2014&month=08&day=11}}</ref><ref name=\"LCFE_2014\">{{cite law|title=DECRETO por el que se expiden la Ley de Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos y la Ley de la Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad, y se reforman y derogan diversas disposiciones de la Ley Federal de las Entidades Paraestatales; la Ley de Adquisiciones, Arrendamientos y Servicios del Sector P\u00fablico y la Ley de Obras P\u00fablicas y Servicios Relacionados con las Mismas (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda)| date={{date|2014-08-11}} |number=DOF: 11/08/2014 |publisher=Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/index.php?year=2014&month=08&day=11}}</ref><ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\"/>\n* Electric Industry Law (LIE). Its objective is to regulate the generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of the electricity, the planning and control of the national electric system (SEN), and the operation of the wholesale electricity marker (MEM). The law gives further attributions to the Secretary of Energy (SENER) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) to execute the energy policies. It also supposes the transfer of certain obligations from the [[Comision Federal de Electricidad|Federal Electricity Commission]] (CFE) to the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE), which becomes independent from CFE, in order to manage the electric system (SEN) and the market (MEM).\n* Federal Electricity Commission Law (LCFE). The firm is established as a \"productive company\" of the state, in order to produce additional value and return of investment through industrial, commercial, or entrepreneurial activities. This contrasts with its previous ordinance in which it only provided electricity as a public service with a fixed [[budget]]. This presumes structural changes in the company, creation of new [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]], resulting in more transparency, better bookkeeping, and increase in operational efficiency.\n* Regulating Institutions in Energy Matters Law. Establishes the collaboration between the most important government bodies, such as SENER and CENACE, in order to implement the energy policies, and recommend changes to them.\n* Other associated laws, such as Geothermic Energy Law, Hydrocarbons Law, [[Pemex]] Law.\n\nDuring this time the SENER published the general rules to obtain and assign [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|clean energy certificates]] (CEL), which are equivalent to 1 [[MWh]] of clean energy, no matter the specific technology. The SENER also mandated that qualified users (big consumers) acquire 5% of their own consumption in CELs for 2018 and 2019.<ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\"/> Furthermore the SENER published simplified rules for interconnection of private generators.<ref name=\"SENER_2015_Pro\"/>\n\nOn 30 June 2015 the government presented the Program for Development of the National Electric System (PRODESEN) which establishes a master plan for the electrical system until 2030.<ref name=\"PRODESEN_2016\">{{cite report |title=Programa de desarrollo del sistema el\u00e9ctrico nacional (PRODESEN) 2016-2030 |author=Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda (SENER) |date={{date|2016-05-30}} |language=Spanish |url=http://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/102166/PRODESEN_2016-2030_1.pdf}}</ref> On 8 September 2015 the SENER published the first Rules for the Electricity Market establishing the new rights and obligations for the generators, resellers, and qualified users of the market, to be overseen by the CRE and the CENACE.

For all tariffs, an interagency group composed of CFE (Federal Electricity Commission, or ''Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad''), LFC (Central Light and Power, or ''Luz y Fuerza del Centro''), SHCP (Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, or ''Secretaria de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico''), SENER (Ministry of Energy, or ''Secretaria de Energia''), CRE (Regulatory Commission of Energy, or ''Comisi\u00f3n Reguladora de la Energ\u00eda''), and CNA (National Water Commission, or '' Comisi\u00f3n Nacional del Agua'') meet regularly and once a year they prepare a tariff proposal for the subsequent year. Tariffs are approved by SHCP and not by the energy sector regulator.<ref name=\"ESMAP_Mex_2004\"/>\n\nExcept for the tariff set for the agricultural sector, average electricity prices have followed an upward trend since the year 2002.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> In 2008, average tariffs for the different sectors were:<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n* Residential: US$ 0.106/kWh\n* Commercial: US$ 0.255/kWh\n* Services: US$ 0.172/kWh\n* Agriculture: US$ 0.051/kWh\n* Industrial: medium industry US$ 0.153/kWh, large industry US$ 0.118/kWh\n\nThe average tariff, US$ 0.137/kWh, was 16.5% higher in 2008 when compared to 2007.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n=== Subsidies ===\n\nFor the industrial and commercial sectors, electricity supply is priced on a rational cost basis for large firms. As a result, they receive no government subsidy, while subsidies for small firms are relatively small. On the other hand, agricultural and residential customers have traditionally received large subsidies since the electricity they consume is significantly underpriced. Extensive subsidies have contributed to a rapid growth in demand. In 2000, the average residential tariff covered only 43% of the costs, while the average tariff for agricultural use covered 31%.<ref name=\"WBank_2004_Mex_exp\"/> Total subsidies amounted to 46% of total electricity sales.<ref name=\"ESMAP_Mex_2004\"/> In addition, residential subsidies were mostly captured by medium and high income classes as the amount of the subsidy raised with consumption.<ref name=\"ESMAP_Mex_2004\"/>\n\nIn 2002, a restructuring of residential tariffs significantly raised the infra-marginal tariffs paid by middle and especially high consumers of electricity. Currently, billing schedules vary by temperature, season and consumption level. In spite of this reform, price/cost ratio was still under 40% in 2002, even after the 21% increase in price due to the reform. In addition, the share of subsidies going to the non-poor population remained high, estimated at 64%. Agricultural tariffs were also modified in 2003, when a fixed price per kWh was fixed. These new tariffs sought charging higher prices for excess energy use.<ref name=\"WBank_2004_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nThe low tariffs, together with LFC's inefficiencies, absorb a large amount of fiscal resources. For 2008, it was estimated that the subsidies paid through electricity tariffs to final CFE and LFC consumers by the Federal Government amounted to US$10 billion<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/> (close to 1% of GDP).\n\n== Investment and Financing ==\n\n=== Investment by sub-sector ===\n\nNecessary investment to carry out the 2008-2017 expansion plan amounts to [[MXN]] 629,106 million (US$47 billion). The breakdown of the investment is: 41.2% for generation, 21.2% for transmission, 23.9% for distribution, 11.8% for maintenance and 1.9% for other needs.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\nFrom the required total, 33.9% corresponds to OFP (''Obras P\u00fablicas Financiadas'' or Financed Public Works), 8.8% to Independent Power Production, 51.5% to budgeted works and the remaining 5.9% to financial schemes still to be defined.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n=== Financing ===\n\n==== Pidiregas ====\n[[Image:Gulf Offshore Platform.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Oil platform in the Campeche [[Sound (geography)|Sound]]]]\n\nIn 1995-1996 the Mexican government created Pidiregas (\"Proyectos de Inversi\u00f3n Diferida En El Registro del Gasto \" \u2013 Investment Projects with Deferred Expenditure Registration) to finance long-term productive infrastructure projects. Due to budgetary restrictions, the government realized that it could not provide all the resources needed and decided to complement the public sector's efforts with Pidiregas, a deferred financing schedule. This mechanism, which only applied to investments carried out by [[PEMEX]](Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos) and CFE aimed to create the conditions for the penetration of private initiatives in [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and electricity generation.<ref name=\"Diputados\">[http://www.diputados.gob.mx/cedia/sia/se/SIA-DEC-44-2003.pdf ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227032913/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/cedia/sia/se/SIA-DEC-44-2003.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}</ref> Pidiregas have been extended and have also grown in amount ([[PEMEX]] uses them for as much as four times the amount of CFE), although the original motivation for their existence is gone.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nFollowing a [[project finance]] scheme, for a project to be executed under Pidiregas, the resources that it generates from the sale of goods and services have to be enough to cover the incurred financial obligations. Projects are paid with the revenues generated during their operation and require the signature of a contract in which a product or work is involved. The State assumes the risk since PEMEX or CFE sign the contract as guarantee, while the investors recover their investment in the agreed time.<ref name=\"Diputados\"/> As a result, Pidiregas cannot be considered as true private investment since, under true private sector participation, firms would make investment decisions and bear the full risk.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/> The viability of the program has been questioned as its effect in the public budget is similar to the emission of public debt. Furthermore, until 2006, the Pidigeras scheme resulted in losses.<ref name=\"Diputados\"/>\n\n==== Grid extension ====\n\nSince 1995, states and municipalities hold the responsibility for the planning and financing of grid extension and off-grid supply. A large part of the investment is financed through FAIS (Fund to Support Social Infrastructure). The [[National Commission for Indigenous People]] and SEDESOL (Secretariat for Social Development) also finance an important share of grid extension. Once a particular system has been constructed, its assets and operational and financial responsibility are transferred to CFE.<ref name=\"WBank_2005_Mex_exp\"/>\n\nRecent studies have concluded that interconnecting [[Baja California]] with the National Interconnected System (SIN) would be both a technically and economically sound decision. This interconnection would allow to serve peak demand in the Baja California system with generation resources from the SIN. Conversely, in period of low demand in Baja California, surplus electricity and base load (i.e. geothermal and combined cycles) could be exported to the SIN. As a result, there would be a reduction of investment costs in generation infrastructure and of total production costs. In addition, the interconnection would open new opportunities for electricity exchanges with power utilities in Western United States through the existing transmission links with California. It is expected that the interconnection will be commissioned in 2013.<ref name=\"SENER_2009_Pro\"/>\n\n==== Renewable energy ====\n\nThe Renewable Energy Law creates a Fund for the Energy Transition and the Sustainable Use of Energy. This fund will assure the financing of projects evaluated and approved by the Technical Committee, chaired by SENER. The fund will begin with US$200 million for each year between 2009 and 2011.\n\n== Summary of private participation in the electricity sector ==\n\nAs required by the Constitution, the electricity sector in Mexico remains federally owned, with the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) essentially controlling the whole sector. Although generation was opened to private participation in 1992, CFE is still the dominant player, with two-thirds of installed capacity.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"|Activity\n!!  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdead;\"|Private participation (%)\n|-\n| Generation\n| 25% of installed capacity\n|-\n| Transmission\n| 0%\n|-\n| Distribution\n| 0%\n|}\n\n== Electricity and the environment ==\n\n=== Responsibility for the environment ===\n\nThe Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), created in 2000 from the previous Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources and Fishing (also SEMARNAT) holds the responsibilities for the environment in Mexico.\n\nSEMARNAT was one of the government agencies within the Intersectoral Commission for Climate Change that elaborated Mexico's Climate Change Strategy.<ref name=\"Climate_change\">SEMARNAT, Estrategia Nacional de Cambio Clim\u00e1tico [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227032915/http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/Documents/Estrategias_libro_completo_compress2.pdf (ENACC)]</ref>\n\n=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===\n\nAccording to Mexico's Third National Communication to the [[UNFCCC]], the country emitted 643 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e) in 2002, of which almost 400 Mt CO2e resulted from the combustion of fossil fuels (over 60 percent of total emissions). The sources of Mexico's GHG emissions are energy generation (24%), transport (18%), forests and land-use change (14%), waste management (10%), manufacturing and construction (8%), industrial processes (8%), agriculture (7%), fugitive emissions (6%), and other uses (5%).<ref name=\"National Communication\">SEMARNAT, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090619213656/http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/queessemarnat/consultaspublicas/Documents/pecc/consultacomplementaria/090323%20PECC%20vcpc.pdf Mexico Third National Communication to the UNFCCC] </ref>\n\n=== Climate change mitigation ===\n\nAlthough the [[Kyoto Protocol]] does not require Mexico to reduce its [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, the country has committed to reduce its emissions voluntarily. In May 2007, President [[Felipe Calder\u00f3n|Calder\u00f3n]] announced the National Climate Change Strategy<ref name=\"Climate_change\"/> which focuses on climate change as a central part of Mexico's national development policy. The ENACC sets the long-term climate change agenda for the country, together with medium to long-term goals for adaptation and mitigation. In December 2008, Mexico announced that it would reduce its GHG emissions by 50% below 2002 levels by 2050.\n\nIn June 2009, the Government of Mexico formally committed itself to a detailed long-term plan for emission reductions embedded in the Special Climate Change Program (PECC)<ref>SEMARNAT, Programa Especial para Cambio Clim\u00e1tico [http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/queessemarnat/consultaspublicas/Documents/pecc/consultacomplementaria/090323%20PECC%20vcpc.pdf (PECC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711025151/http://www.semarnat.gob.mx/queessemarnat/consultaspublicas/Documents/pecc/consultacomplementaria/090323%20PECC%20vcpc.pdf |date=July 11, 2009 }}</ref> that provides an accounting of emissions by sector, creates a framework for monitoring improvements and establishes a legally binding blueprint for emission reduction initiatives, sector by sector.

He later appears as the main protagonist in the 2015 [[anime]] film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' where he is training as a ninja to surpass his father, the leader of the ninja village Konohagakure and also being mentored by his father's best friend, [[Sasuke Uchiha]]. Boruto also serves as a protagonist in the manga and anime series ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]].'' In the manga, it starts off with the retelling of the ''Boruto'' film, while the anime begins with his childhood in the ninja academy where he meets his future teammates\u2014[[Sarada Uchiha]] and [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]]\u2014as well as his teacher, [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]].\n\nDespite Boruto's physical designs being similar to Naruto when he was young, their personalities are developed differently. Boruto's relationship with his father reflects Kishimoto's relationship with his children. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by [[Kokoro Kikuchi]] in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and by [[Y\u016bko Sanpei]] in all subsequent appearances. Sanpei enjoyed doing the work of Boruto's acting, finding him endearing. In the English version, he is voiced by [[Amanda C. Miller]].\n\nBoruto's character has received mixed critical responses. His relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the ''Naruto'' manga. In ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father's actions.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nMasashi Kishimoto created Boruto in 2013 when the manga ''[[Naruto]]'' was at its climax. The motivation for the creation was him wanting [[Naruto Uzumaki]] to become a father when the manga ends.<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |title=\u300cBoruto -Naruto The Movie-\u300d\u5267\u573a\u7248\u4e0a\u6620\u524d\u7279\u522b\u8282\u76ee |date=August 5, 2015 |publisher=AC Fun |access-date=June 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701041528/http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |archivedate=July 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the finale of ''Naruto'', Boruto makes a prank in the mountain of Konoha that shows all its leaders, the Hokages.

One of the singers of the band stated that it reflects how the character constantly changes from the beginning to the end of the story.<ref name=\"interview\" />\n\nBoruto's mentorship by Naruto's rival and best friend [[Sasuke Uchiha]] was influenced due to the latter having few appearances in the ''Naruto'' movies. Kishimoto decided that he wanted Sasuke to have a major role in ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', which he wrote. In the film, Sasuke becomes the teacher of Naruto's first son, Boruto, inspired by [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series by [[Akira Toriyama]]. A former enemy of ''Dragon Ball'' protagonist [[Goku]], Piccolo becomes the teacher of Goku's first son, [[Gohan]].<ref>{{cite video |title= Boruto: Naruto the Movie |year=2015 |medium=DVD}} studio: Pierrot.</ref> ''Boruto'' anime and film director Hiroyuki Yamashita said that when first seeing the character in [[Sarada Uchiha]]'s [[Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring|spin-off]], he liked his character. In the making of the ''Boruto'' film, Yamashita said some scenes regarding to Boruto were removed due to time constraints such as one of the character's interactions with his father as well as another interaction between Boruto and Sarada. A difficult scene for the staff was the use of Boruto's {{nihongo|Rasengan|\u87ba\u65cb\u4e38||lit. spiral sphere, English manga: \"Spiral Chakra Sphere\"}} technique which had to disappear shortly after being used and then appearing again in an attack.

Additionally, he gave him a simpler costume than Naruto's original one that would yet remain the symbol of the Uzumaki clan. The author purposefully let Boruto wear his clothes casually by making him wear his jacket unzipped since he found it suitable for the character's personality.<ref>{{cite book|title=NARUTO -\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8- \u79d8\u4f1d\u30fb\u5728\u306e\u66f8 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e0\u30fc\u30d3\u30fcBOOK|trans-title=Naruto Secret: Scroll of Country Official Moviebook|year=2015|page=42|publisher=Shueisha|language=Japanese}}</ref> For the finale of the manga, Kishimoto originally intended to give Boruto the Byakugan, an eye technique which he would inherit from his mother [[Hinata Hyuga]].

He later appears as the main protagonist in the 2015 [[anime]] film ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' where he is training as a ninja to surpass his father, the leader of the ninja village Konohagakure and also being mentored by his father's best friend, [[Sasuke Uchiha]]. Boruto also serves as a protagonist in the manga and anime series ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]].'' In the manga, it starts off with the retelling of the ''Boruto'' film, while the anime begins with his childhood in the ninja academy where he meets his future teammates\u2014[[Sarada Uchiha]] and [[Mitsuki (Naruto)|Mitsuki]]\u2014as well as his teacher, [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]].\n\nDespite Boruto's physical designs being similar to Naruto when he was young, their personalities are developed differently. Boruto's relationship with his father reflects Kishimoto's relationship with his children. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by [[Kokoro Kikuchi]] in ''[[The Last: Naruto the Movie]]'' and by [[Y\u016bko Sanpei]] in all subsequent appearances. Sanpei enjoyed doing the work of Boruto's acting, finding him endearing. In the English version, he is voiced by [[Amanda C. Miller]].\n\nBoruto's character has received mixed critical responses. His relationship with his father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the ''Naruto'' manga. In ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', his development was praised due to his action scenes and how he understood his father's actions.\n\n==Creation and conception==\nMasashi Kishimoto created Boruto in 2013 when the manga ''[[Naruto]]'' was at its climax. The motivation for the creation was him wanting [[Naruto Uzumaki]] to become a father when the manga ends.<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |title=\u300cBoruto -Naruto The Movie-\u300d\u5267\u573a\u7248\u4e0a\u6620\u524d\u7279\u522b\u8282\u76ee |date=August 5, 2015 |publisher=AC Fun |access-date=June 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701041528/http://honyakusha-eri.tumblr.com/post/126058154478/summary-of-talk-show-about-the-boruto-movie |archivedate=July 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the finale of ''Naruto'', Boruto makes a prank in the mountain of Konoha that shows all its leaders, the Hokages.

Kishimoto decided that he wanted Sasuke to have a major role in ''Boruto: Naruto the Movie'', which he wrote. In the film, Sasuke becomes the teacher of Naruto's first son, Boruto, inspired by [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series by [[Akira Toriyama]].

In the making of the ''Boruto'' film, Yamashita said some scenes regarding to Boruto were removed due to time constraints such as one of the character's interactions with his father as well as another interaction between Boruto and Sarada. A difficult scene for the staff was the use of Boruto's {{nihongo|Rasengan|\u87ba\u65cb\u4e38||lit. spiral sphere, English manga: \"Spiral Chakra Sphere\"}} technique which had to disappear shortly after being used and then appearing again in an attack.

Additionally, he gave him a simpler costume than Naruto's original one that would yet remain the symbol of the Uzumaki clan.

Additionally, Dargis noted Boruto's early strained relationship with his father as well as his use of technology to fight might reflect on modern audiences who might understand his character more as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fandompost.com/2017/10/16/boruto-vol-02-manga-review/|title=Boruto Vol. #02 Manga Review|publisher=The Fandom Post|date=October 16, 2016|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> As the character developed, Stewart enjoyed Boruto due to his childish personality as he starts acting like a hero from an action film he just watched worrying his family in the process. Additionally, the reviewer liked how Boruto's mysterious \"Eye Technique\" started making references to a previous ''Naruto'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-8-the-dreams-revelation-review|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 8: \"The Dream's Revelation\" Review|website=IGN|date=May 25, 2017|accessdate=June 1, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170701060640/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/boruto-naruto-next-generations-episode-8-the-dreams-revelation-review|archivedate=July 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While comparing Boruto's traits to main characters often seen in other manga series, McNulty felt that Boruto's growth across the anime series helped to make him more likable.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/boruto-naruto-next-generations/episodes-31-32/.123784|title=Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episodes 31-32|work=Anime News Network|date=November 8, 2017|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> Theatergoers for the ''Boruto'' film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Boruto and Naruto's images.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-07-28/naruto-creator-on-being-asked-for-sequel-please-let-me-rest-now/.90993|title=Naruto Creator on Being Asked for Sequel: 'Please Let Me Rest Now'|work=Anime News Network|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> Boruto's entire clothing is also being sold as merchandising.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://manga.tokyo/goods-news/boruto-recommends-boruto-naruto-next-generations-shinobi-jacket/|title=Boruto Recommends: Boruto \u2013 Naruto Next Generations Shinobi Jacket|publisher=Manga Tokyo|author=Trilica, Martina|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Anime and manga}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170822035737/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0514715/ Boruto Uzumaki] on [[IMDb]]\n\n{{Naruto}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Uzumaki, Boruto}}\n[[Category:Child characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2014]]\n[[Category:Fictional avatars]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with air or wind abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with water abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordsmen]]\n[[Category:Male characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Naruto characters]]\n", "name_user": "2601:410:280:1f70:952:56cc:338d:59e6", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto_Uzumaki"}
