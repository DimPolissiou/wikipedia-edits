Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #120 (April 1979) as a member of the [[Canadians|Canadian]] superhero team, [[Alpha Flight]].<ref name=created/>\n\nAurora is the twin sister of [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and the former lover of [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] and [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]]. The character struggled with a [[dissociative identity disorder]] for years leading to two distinctive personalities, the quiet, religious Jeanne-Marie and the outgoing, heroic, uninhibited Aurora. Aurora and Northstar worked together for years as part of Alpha Flight, including dealing with Beaubier's struggles with her personality disorders. She was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]] and also participated in the [[Weapon X]] program in an attempt to gain control of her splintered personalities.\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Aurora alongside Northstar, Sasquatch, and [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] are reunited with a resurrected [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]] and [[Marrina Smallwood|Marrina]], reforming Alpha Flight.\n\n==Publication history==\n\nAurora first appeared in ''X-Men'' #120 as a member of [[Alpha Flight]], and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref name=created>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Jeanne-Marie Beaubier''' was born in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.  She and her twin brother Jean-Paul were separated in infancy after their parents died.  Jean-Paul was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Louis Martin, who were cousins of his mother.  The Martins could not afford to adopt Jeanne-Marie as well and arranged for Jeanne-Marie to be raised at Madame DuPont's School for Girls in Laval, Quebec, a reactionary religious school.  Soon afterward, the Martins moved to Northern Quebec.  The Martins were killed in an accident several years later and Jean-Paul was placed in a foster home, unaware that he had a sister.\n\nExtremely nervous and introverted, Jeanne-Marie Beaubier was miserable at Madame DuPont's School.  At the age of thirteen, she attempted [[suicide]] by throwing herself from the roof of one of the school's buildings.  Instead of falling to her death, Beaubier discovered that she could fly at great speed.  Unaware that she was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], the deeply religious Beaubier believed that her flight was the result of a divine miracle.  The next morning, she explained to the school's headmistress what she believed had happened.  Believing the young girl to be guilty of [[blasphemy]], the headmistress had Beaubier [[corporal punishment|severely disciplined]].  This incident (and possibly other abuse) triggered a [[dissociative identity disorder]] in Jeanne-Marie; a second personality, extroverted and far more uninhibited, emerged.  Under the influence of this second personality, Beaubier secretly left the school that same night.  Returning three days later, she had no memory of where she had been or what she had done and she was again physically punished.  The resulting trauma was so great that Beaubier repressed her second personality.\n\n===Alpha Flight===\nFive years later, Beaubier's application to become a teacher of history and geography at the school was accepted.  By this time, Beaubier had adjusted to life at the school and her everyday personality was that of a prim, proper, repressed woman.  The same night that her application was accepted, her second personality re-emerged and she left to enjoy herself in Montreal.  Confronted by muggers, she knocked one unconscious by moving at superhuman speed (this was the first time that she had used her superhuman powers in five years).  The second mugger was halted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who had witnessed the attempted assault.  Recognizing that Beaubier had superhuman powers, Wolverine invited her to go to Ottawa to meet [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]], who was organizing a team of superhumanly powerful agents for the Canadian government's Department H.  Hudson accepted her as a recruit and reunited her with her brother.  After a period of training, both Beaubier siblings joined the team that Hudson created, [[Alpha Flight]], under the code names Aurora and Northstar.<ref>''X-Men'' #120 (Apr. 1979) Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nOn Alpha Flight's first mission, Aurora aided in combating the [[X-Men]] to capture Wolverine.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #120-121</ref>  With Northstar, she battled [[Deadly Ernest]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #7-8</ref>  She later recounted how she developed her superhuman powers and developed her Aurora personality, and how Wolverine recruited her into Alpha Flight,<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #9</ref> as well as how she met Northstar.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #10</ref>  Aurora later had a falling out with her brother, and upon her wish to separate herself from her brother, her powers were altered by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Walter Langowski]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #17</ref>  Aurora was captured by [[Gilded Lily (character)|Gilded Lily]], but was rescued by Sasquatch, who began to suspect that she was manifesting a third personality.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #20-21</ref>  With Northstar, she battled [[Pink Pearl (comics)|Pink Pearl]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #22</ref>\n\nShe was later temporarily cured of her multiple personalities.

The team brought her and Northstar to the place where they once encountered a magical Firefountain; they wanted to heal her mind and Northstar's body. During a battle with dark elves, she cured her brother by giving him all of her light.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #50</ref>  She was carried off by the elves, but Loki (in an attempt to curry favor with Those Who Sit Above In Shadow) transported her to a convent for safety, who took her in.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #64</ref>\n\nTalisman later came to Jean-Marie at the convent and transported her to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] along with Persuasion, Goblyn and Laura Dean to help rescue Northstar in Alfheim. He had gone to Asgard to explore their half-elf heritage, only to discover that Loki lied about that. Northstar had been trapped on Asgard for months. In battle, Northstar shared the light with Aurora and restored her powers. After their battle with the sorcerer LLan, she rejoined Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #81-82, 85</ref>  Aurora soon discovered that she could now generate a light that bestowed inner peace in others.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #88-89</ref>  With Alpha Flight and the [[Fantastic Four]], she fought against [[Headlok]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #93-96</ref>  Headlok mentally manipulated her, causing her to revert to her original split personality, and she then killed Headlok.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #102-104</ref>  She soon thereafter had a rematch with Pink Pearl.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #105</ref>  Eventually, the original incarnation of Alpha Flight disbanded.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #130</ref>\n\n===Resurfacing and rehabilitation===\nIn the events leading up her reappearance in ''Weapon X'' vol. 2, Aurora's mental health continues to deteriorate and she is later turned into a [[mind control]]led agent of [[Weapon X]].  She also engages in an abusive relationship with the Weapon X director, [[Malcolm Colcord]], who frequently beat her.<ref>''Weapon X: The Draft''</ref>  Aurora manages to retaliate against her mind-control by creating a third personality that was unaffected by her situation.  She attacks Colcord and manages to escape.<ref>''Weapon X: Days of Future Now''</ref>  In her next appearance, Aurora's mental state becomes unstable to the point that all her personalities agree that suicide is the best solution.<ref name=Return>''X-Men'' vol. 2 \"Supernovas\" (August 2007) Marvel Comics</ref>  However, she is stopped by the arrival of Northstar, who is under the control of the [[Children of the Vault]], a mysterious group of newly emerged superhumans who seek to destroy mutants, viewing them to be their competition for dominance of the planet.  One of the Children, [[Serafina (Marvel)|Serafina]], places the twins under their control, largely repairing Aurora's fragile psyche, boosting the twins' powers and altering them so that they can generate not only light when in contact with each other, but heat as well.\n\nThe twins are sent on a mission to attack the X-Men and retrieve [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] for the Children of the Vault.  The twins are able to defeat several of the X-Men and [[New X-Men]] until Mystique is able to exploit Aurora's shattered psyche by taking on her image.  [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] manages to incapacitate Aurora while [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] subdues Northstar.<ref name=Return />\n\nThe X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] in an attempt to fix the mental damage inflicted on the twins.  Using their [[virtual reality]] equipment the X-Men allowed the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace.  The process was interrupted near the end of the session by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], creating a telepathic connection between the twins.  Using each other's emotional support, they manage to face their inner personal turmoils and regain control of their minds.  Aurora and Northstar also gain a higher level of control over their powers, which they use to save [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] from the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolyte]] known as [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]].<ref name=Return />  They later reappear in the mini-crossover series ''Secret Invasion: X-Men'', joining the X-Men when the [[Skrull]] invasion reaches San Francisco.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #2</ref>\n\nAurora next appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', having formed a snowsporting company with Northstar, Team Northstar Extreme Snowsports.  Aurora appears to be living a relatively normal life since regaining control of her mind, working as the joint CEO of the company.  She is contacted by Wolverine when he wishes to extend an invitation to Northstar to join X-Men on Utopia.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref>\n\nDuring one of Aurora's therapy sessions to deal with her disorder, she is given a device to wear on her head for tests, when in actuality, her therapist was bribed by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to use it on her so he could speak with her more dark and violent personality about joining his [[Dark X-Men]]. Jeanne-Marie, though, does not care to take orders from anyone, least of all someone who is just as broken as herself, and goes to leave, before he turns the device on her again, saying he does not take no for an answer. However, Aurora brings up another personality to combat the guards, and brings up more for each time the device is used on her, before she is able to turn it on Osborn himself and walk away.<ref>''Dark X-Men: The Beginning'' #3</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Aurora alongside Northstar, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and [[Marrina Smallwood]].<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Aurora appears as a member of the Alpha Flight space program.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 9, #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:Northstar and Aurora.jpg|200px|thumb|Northstar and Aurora. Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].]]\nAurora has the powers of flight and superhuman speed and reflexes (theoretically able to approach light-speed. This has never been attempted since if any being or amount of matter were to approach the speed of light in our solar system, it would wreak devastating havoc on the gravitational forces holding our system together). The greater her increase in speed, the more durable her body becomes, but this ability has not been measured.\n\nShe also has super-human levels of endurance and stamina that allows her to maintain her super-speed. In an early issue of ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'', Northstar reveals to readers that Aurora has greater endurance and can fly longer, while he can fly faster in the same period of time.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1 (1983)</ref>  Her strength and reaction time are above-average for a woman of her age and exercise level, however, Aurora usually doesn't rely on her physical strength while battling opponents and, instead, uses super-speed tricks, like flying with someone at great speed until they pass out from lack of oxygen or pummeling them with hundreds of punches a second until they succumb. Aurora also uses her super speed to perform stunts such as creating a cyclone by running in circles, running up walls and across water, and she could breathe while traveling at subsonic speeds.\n\nOriginally, while in physical contact with her brother, usually while holding hands, the pair could emit bursts of brilliant white light with an average flash equal in intensity of one million [[candela]] (one candela being equal to the amount of light created by one candle). It was generally used to blind their opponents, but with the minor drawback that they were not able to control its intensity.\n\nAurora is moderately skilled in hand-to-hand combat using a style utilizing her superhuman speed, and received coaching from [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] and Wolverine.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and Aurora were part of [[Mister Sinister]]'s Elite Mutant Force (E.M.F.) and, as such, were assigned to patrolling the breeding pens.  The siblings fully embraced their beliefs of mutant superiority and seemed to take great pleasure in punishing those prisoners who acted up or tried to escape.  When the E.M.F.'s leader, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], switched sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he was caught in the act by the speeding twins.  However, both of them were defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happened to be [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]].<ref>''Factor-X'' #2 (1995)</ref>  When the series was revisited for the 10 year anniversary, it was revealed that following the fall of Apocalypse's regime, the Beaubiers became fugitives until they were killed by [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Age of Apocalypse|Weapon X]] and [[X-23#Age of Apocalypse|Kirika]].<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #2 (May 2005) Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified [[Alpha Flight#Marvel Zombies|Alpha Flight]] attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Aurora is seen in a panel of ''Marvel Zombies Dead Days'' attacking the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] alongside her brother [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]].  The two are killed by Magneto only moments later.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' #2</ref>\n\n===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===\nIn the ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' storyline, Aurora is one of the mutants that Wolverine recruits in order to resurrect the X-Men after all except himself and Angel were killed by [[Weapon X]] under [[Malcolm Colcord]]. She joins Wolverine's new, more violent X-Men along with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], and [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #3</ref>\n\nShe is killed along with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], Sunfire, and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], when it is revealed that Agent Zero has been made into a sleeper agent for [[Weapon X]] through the use of [[Mesmero (comics)|Mesmero]]'s mutant hypnotic abilities.  He ambushes his teammates in their base, killing or severely wounding them with gunfire and his concussive energy blasts. Eventually, he takes his own life when he manages to break free of Weapon X's control, moments before killing Wolverine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Earth X===\nIn [[Earth X]], Aurora is still a member of Alpha Flight.  However, she was killed alongside her team by the Tong of Creel.<ref>''Universe X'' #2</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nIn What If? Cyclops and Jean Gray Had Married Sooner, Professor X recruited Aurora as part of a new team of X-Men when his originals all left his teaching years earlier than expected. She, Northstar, Catseye, Colossus and Storm trained briefly before they and the professor were all killed fighting Krakoa the living island. The Avengers stopped Krakoa, and when they blew it apart, they discovered the X-Men's bodies.{{issue|date=December 2017}}\n\n===X-Men: The End===\nIn the [[X-Men: The End]] universe, Aurora's image appears as a spirit to her brother.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #2</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, a woman similar to Aurora is seen with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] who is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D, responsible for training a squad of young mutants and superhumans in the agency's junior training squad program. However, she is only seen briefly.<ref>''New X-Men'' #16</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nAn [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Aurora makes her debut in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #94 as part of [[Alpha Flight#Ultimate Alpha Flight|Alpha Flight]]. Like her mainstream counterpart, she is the sister of [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]]. The two seem to share a distant relationship, because Aurora still works for Department H, somewhere that Jean-Paul ran from claiming they were crazy.  She is the one who physically takes her brother captive.  Her power seemed to be speed based, but, according to her and due to being enhanced by the Mutant Growth Hormone known as Banshee, she is faster than light; something which she proved by being able to remove [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]' grip on their jet without him being aware of it. Later, when the X-Men attack their base to rescue Northstar, she is quickly taken down by [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], who has also enhanced her abilities with Banshee.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94</ref>\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, the deceased Aurora is the motivation of her brother's attempts to kill [[Kitty Pryde]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #245</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Aurora appeared in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] episodes \"Slave Island\" and \"Repo Man\".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Slave Island |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=X-Men |series-link= X-Men (TV series)|first= |last= |network=Fox |station= |date=February 13, 1993 |season=1 |series-no= |number=7 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=Repo Man |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=X-Men |series-link=X-Men (TV series) |first= |last= |network=Fox |station= |date=November 20, 1993 |season=2 |series-no= |number=18 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Aurora Aurora] at Marvel.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100027/http://www.alphaflight.net/alphanex/index.php?title=Aurora '''AlphaFlight.Net''' Alphanex Entry on - Aurora]\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/aurora Uncannyxmen.net Spotlight On...Aurora]\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aurora (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Canadian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional Canadian people of French descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Quebec]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate light]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities]]\n[[Category:Fictional nuns]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image= [[Image:Aurorabyrne.png|200px]]\n| caption= Aurora.

After their battle with the sorcerer LLan, she rejoined Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #81-82, 85</ref>  Aurora soon discovered that she could now generate a light that bestowed inner peace in others.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #88-89</ref>  With Alpha Flight and the [[Fantastic Four]], she fought against [[Headlok]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #93-96</ref>  Headlok mentally manipulated her, causing her to revert to her original split personality, and she then killed Headlok.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #102-104</ref>  She soon thereafter had a rematch with Pink Pearl.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #105</ref>  Eventually, the original incarnation of Alpha Flight disbanded.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #130</ref>\n\n===Resurfacing and rehabilitation===\nIn the events leading up her reappearance in ''Weapon X'' vol. 2, Aurora's mental health continues to deteriorate and she is later turned into a [[mind control]]led agent of [[Weapon X]].  She also engages in an abusive relationship with the Weapon X director, [[Malcolm Colcord]], who frequently beat her.<ref>''Weapon X: The Draft''</ref>  Aurora manages to retaliate against her mind-control by creating a third personality that was unaffected by her situation.  She attacks Colcord and manages to escape.<ref>''Weapon X: Days of Future Now''</ref>  In her next appearance, Aurora's mental state becomes unstable to the point that all her personalities agree that suicide is the best solution.<ref name=Return>''X-Men'' vol. 2 \"Supernovas\" (August 2007) Marvel Comics</ref>  However, she is stopped by the arrival of Northstar, who is under the control of the [[Children of the Vault]], a mysterious group of newly emerged superhumans who seek to destroy mutants, viewing them to be their competition for dominance of the planet.  One of the Children, [[Serafina (Marvel)|Serafina]], places the twins under their control, largely repairing Aurora's fragile psyche, boosting the twins' powers and altering them so that they can generate not only light when in contact with each other, but heat as well.\n\nThe twins are sent on a mission to attack the X-Men and retrieve [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] for the Children of the Vault.  The twins are able to defeat several of the X-Men and [[New X-Men]] until Mystique is able to exploit Aurora's shattered psyche by taking on her image.  [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] manages to incapacitate Aurora while [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] subdues Northstar.<ref name=Return />\n\nThe X-Men take Northstar and Aurora to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] in an attempt to fix the mental damage inflicted on the twins.  Using their [[virtual reality]] equipment the X-Men allowed the twins to relive their lives at an accelerated pace.  The process was interrupted near the end of the session by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], creating a telepathic connection between the twins.  Using each other's emotional support, they manage to face their inner personal turmoils and regain control of their minds.  Aurora and Northstar also gain a higher level of control over their powers, which they use to save [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] from the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolyte]] known as [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]].<ref name=Return />  They later reappear in the mini-crossover series ''Secret Invasion: X-Men'', joining the X-Men when the [[Skrull]] invasion reaches San Francisco.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #2</ref>\n\nAurora next appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', having formed a snowsporting company with Northstar, Team Northstar Extreme Snowsports.  Aurora appears to be living a relatively normal life since regaining control of her mind, working as the joint CEO of the company.  She is contacted by Wolverine when he wishes to extend an invitation to Northstar to join X-Men on Utopia.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #508</ref>\n\nDuring one of Aurora's therapy sessions to deal with her disorder, she is given a device to wear on her head for tests, when in actuality, her therapist was bribed by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to use it on her so he could speak with her more dark and violent personality about joining his [[Dark X-Men]]. Jeanne-Marie, though, does not care to take orders from anyone, least of all someone who is just as broken as herself, and goes to leave, before he turns the device on her again, saying he does not take no for an answer. However, Aurora brings up another personality to combat the guards, and brings up more for each time the device is used on her, before she is able to turn it on Osborn himself and walk away.<ref>''Dark X-Men: The Beginning'' #3</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Aurora alongside Northstar, Sasquatch, and Snowbird are reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and [[Marrina Smallwood]].<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Aurora appears as a member of the Alpha Flight space program.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 9, #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:Northstar and Aurora.jpg|200px|thumb|Northstar and Aurora. Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].]]\nAurora has the powers of flight and superhuman speed and reflexes (theoretically able to approach light-speed. This has never been attempted since if any being or amount of matter were to approach the speed of light in our solar system, it would wreak devastating havoc on the gravitational forces holding our system together). The greater her increase in speed, the more durable her body becomes, but this ability has not been measured.\n\nShe also has super-human levels of endurance and stamina that allows her to maintain her super-speed. In an early issue of ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'', Northstar reveals to readers that Aurora has greater endurance and can fly longer, while he can fly faster in the same period of time.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1 (1983)</ref>  Her strength and reaction time are above-average for a woman of her age and exercise level, however, Aurora usually doesn't rely on her physical strength while battling opponents and, instead, uses super-speed tricks, like flying with someone at great speed until they pass out from lack of oxygen or pummeling them with hundreds of punches a second until they succumb. Aurora also uses her super speed to perform stunts such as creating a cyclone by running in circles, running up walls and across water, and she could breathe while traveling at subsonic speeds.\n\nOriginally, while in physical contact with her brother, usually while holding hands, the pair could emit bursts of brilliant white light with an average flash equal in intensity of one million [[candela]] (one candela being equal to the amount of light created by one candle). It was generally used to blind their opponents, but with the minor drawback that they were not able to control its intensity.\n\nAurora is moderately skilled in hand-to-hand combat using a style utilizing her superhuman speed, and received coaching from [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] and Wolverine.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and Aurora were part of [[Mister Sinister]]'s Elite Mutant Force (E.M.F.) and, as such, were assigned to patrolling the breeding pens.  The siblings fully embraced their beliefs of mutant superiority and seemed to take great pleasure in punishing those prisoners who acted up or tried to escape.  When the E.M.F.'s leader, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], switched sides, secretly helping some inmates to escape, he was caught in the act by the speeding twins.  However, both of them were defeated by Cyclops and the prisoner he was helping to escape, which happened to be [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]].<ref>''Factor-X'' #2 (1995)</ref>  When the series was revisited for the 10 year anniversary, it was revealed that following the fall of Apocalypse's regime, the Beaubiers became fugitives until they were killed by [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Age of Apocalypse|Weapon X]] and [[X-23#Age of Apocalypse|Kirika]].<ref>''X-Men: Age of Apocalypse'' #2 (May 2005) Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified [[Alpha Flight#Marvel Zombies|Alpha Flight]] attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. Aurora is seen in a panel of ''Marvel Zombies Dead Days'' attacking the X-Man [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] alongside her brother [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]].  The two are killed by Magneto only moments later.<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'' #2</ref>\n\n===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===\nIn the ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' storyline, Aurora is one of the mutants that Wolverine recruits in order to resurrect the X-Men after all except himself and Angel were killed by [[Weapon X]] under [[Malcolm Colcord]]. She joins Wolverine's new, more violent X-Men along with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], and [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #3</ref>\n\nShe is killed along with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], Sunfire, and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], when it is revealed that Agent Zero has been made into a sleeper agent for [[Weapon X]] through the use of [[Mesmero (comics)|Mesmero]]'s mutant hypnotic abilities.  He ambushes his teammates in their base, killing or severely wounding them with gunfire and his concussive energy blasts. Eventually, he takes his own life when he manages to break free of Weapon X's control, moments before killing Wolverine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Earth X===\nIn [[Earth X]], Aurora is still a member of Alpha Flight.  However, she was killed alongside her team by the Tong of Creel.<ref>''Universe X'' #2</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nIn What If? Cyclops and Jean Gray Had Married Sooner, Professor X recruited Aurora as part of a new team of X-Men when his originals all left his teaching years earlier than expected. She, Northstar, Catseye, Colossus and Storm trained briefly before they and the professor were all killed fighting Krakoa the living island. The Avengers stopped Krakoa, and when they blew it apart, they discovered the X-Men's bodies.{{issue|date=December 2017}}\n\n===X-Men: The End===\nIn the [[X-Men: The End]] universe, Aurora's image appears as a spirit to her brother.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' #2</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, a woman similar to Aurora is seen with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] who is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D, responsible for training a squad of young mutants and superhumans in the agency's junior training squad program. However, she is only seen briefly.<ref>''New X-Men'' #16</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nAn [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Aurora makes her debut in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #94 as part of [[Alpha Flight#Ultimate Alpha Flight|Alpha Flight]]. Like her mainstream counterpart, she is the sister of [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]]. The two seem to share a distant relationship, because Aurora still works for Department H, somewhere that Jean-Paul ran from claiming they were crazy.  She is the one who physically takes her brother captive.  Her power seemed to be speed based, but, according to her and due to being enhanced by the Mutant Growth Hormone known as Banshee, she is faster than light; something which she proved by being able to remove [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]' grip on their jet without him being aware of it. Later, when the X-Men attack their base to rescue Northstar, she is quickly taken down by [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], who has also enhanced her abilities with Banshee.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #94</ref>\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, the deceased Aurora is the motivation of her brother's attempts to kill [[Kitty Pryde]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #245</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Aurora appeared in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] episodes \"Slave Island\" and \"Repo Man\".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Slave Island |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=X-Men |series-link= X-Men (TV series)|first= |last= |network=Fox |station= |date=February 13, 1993 |season=1 |series-no= |number=7 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |title=Repo Man |episode-link= |url= |access-date= |series=X-Men |series-link=X-Men (TV series) |first= |last= |network=Fox |station= |date=November 20, 1993 |season=2 |series-no= |number=18 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Aurora Aurora] at Marvel.com\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100027/http://www.alphaflight.net/alphanex/index.php?title=Aurora '''AlphaFlight.Net''' Alphanex Entry on - Aurora]\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/aurora Uncannyxmen.net Spotlight On...Aurora]\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aurora (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Canadian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional Canadian people of French descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Quebec]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate light]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities]]\n[[Category:Fictional nuns]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]\n", "name_user": "TCB297", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFictional character biography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(comics)"}

Tervel was awarded with the title [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], a huge amount of gold, silver and garments as well as the region called [[Zagore (region)|Zagore]] to the south of [[Stara Planina]].
