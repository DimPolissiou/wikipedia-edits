It was the [[sister station]] to AM 1240 [[KRDO (AM)|KRDO]], which Hoth had first put on the air in 1947, Colorado Springs' second radio station. KRDO-FM broadcast a [[beautiful music]] format of instrumental songs.\n\nAs the [[easy listening]] format began to decline due to older demographics, KRDO-FM flipped to a [[soft adult contemporary]] sound and adopted the moniker \"Peak 95.1\" in 1994. In 1998 Peak 95.1 evolved into a [[Hot AC]] format.\n\nAfter being purchased by [[Citadel Broadcasting]], the station prepared for a major format switch.  \"Cat Country 95.1\" began broadcasting on July 1, 2006, [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] by repeatedly playing [[Brooks & Dunn]]'s \"Play Something Country\" while temporarily using its former KRDO-FM call letters. After several days of stunting, the station began its regular mainstream country programming, featuring a complete air staff. The call sign was changed to '''KATC-FM''' with the call letters a disambiguation of '''CAT'''. Citadel would revive the Peak moniker and AC format in late 2006 on sister station 92.9 FM with the new call letters [[KKPK]]. The KRDO-FM call sign was quickly picked up by the [[News-Press & Gazette Company]]/Pikes Peak Radio, to pair with its previous partners, 1240 KRDO and Channel 13 [[KRDO-TV]].

It was the [[sister station]] to AM 1240 [[KRDO (AM)|KRDO]], which Hoth had first put on the air in 1947, Colorado Springs' second radio station. KRDO-FM broadcast a [[beautiful music]] format of instrumental songs.\n\nAs the [[easy listening]] format began to decline due to older demographics, KRDO-FM flipped to a [[soft adult contemporary]] sound and adopted the moniker \"Peak 95.1\" in 1994. In 1998 Peak 95.1 evolved into a [[Hot AC]] format.\n\nAfter being purchased by [[Citadel Broadcasting]], the station prepared for a major format switch.  \"Cat Country 95.1\" began broadcasting on July 1, 2006, [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] by repeatedly playing [[Brooks & Dunn]]'s \"Play Something Country\" while temporarily using its former KRDO-FM call letters. After several days of stunting, the station began its regular mainstream country programming, featuring a complete air staff. The call sign was changed to '''KATC-FM''' with the call letters a disambiguation of '''CAT'''. Citadel would revive the Peak moniker and AC format in late 2006 on sister station 92.9 FM with the new call letters [[KKPK]]. The KRDO-FM call sign was quickly picked up by the [[News-Press & Gazette Company]]/Pikes Peak Radio, to pair with its previous partners, 1240 KRDO and Channel 13 [[KRDO-TV]]. The New KRDO-FM station broadcasts on 105.5 FM.\n\nCitadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.<ref name=abj-citadelcumulus>{{cite news|title=Cumulus now owns Citadel Broadcasting|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/09/16/cumulus-now-owns-citadel-broadcasting.html|accessdate=September 16, 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Business Journal|date=September 16, 2011}}</ref> On October 31, 2014 KATC rebranded as \"[[Nash FM]] 95.1\".

The original score was utilized along with several additional Rodgers and Hart songs. [[Randy Skinner]] choreographed the production.\n\n==Plot of original 1937 version==\n''Babes in Arms'' opens in Seaport, Rhode Island in the 1930s. Val and Marshall's vaudeville parents leave them behind to do the circuits. Val then meets Billie, a girl who has driven from the coast, only to have her car break down. They then sing a love song about how they feel as though they have met before (Where or When).\n\nThe Sheriff then visits them to inform them that they have to work at the work farm because they are not yet 21. They then decide that they will stick around instead and find another way to support themselves (Babes in Arms). \nThe \u201ckids\u201d form a group with Val as the leader. After deciding nothing, except that violence is good, they disperse. Dolores, the Sheriff's daughter, talks to Gus, her ex, who tries to woo her, failing. They then sing and flirt about how they do not care that their relationship is over (I Wish I Were in Love Again).\n\nMarshall then arrives, jealous. Then Val enters mentioning that he has also kissed her, a fight begins and escalates when others enter. The sheriff comes in and the kids pretend to be dancing. This causes Val to decide to put on their own follies. The Sheriff decides to give them two weeks to put on the show (Babes in Arms Reprise).\n\nLater, Val enters and tells Irving and Ivor to practice their number (Light on Our Feet). Lee then arrives and chastises his brother, Beauregard, for hanging out with \u201cthe blacks\u201d. Billie then uses her womanly guiles to convince Lee to invest his money in the show. Lee then smears some of her lipstick on his cheek and convinces the boys that she kissed him. They then bring on \u201cBaby Rose\u201d a former child star to be in their show who performs a number she learned (Way Out West).\n\nBillie then enters with a jealous Val. After calming him, they discuss the show. Lee does not want Irving and Ivor in the show, After learning this, Val leaves in a huff. Billie reflects on her romance with Val (My Funny Valentine). They transition into the day of the show and show the final number of the follies performed by Baby Rose (Johnny One Note). Backstage, Lee and Val fight over letting Irving and Ivor go on despite their race. Val punches Lee and Irving and Ivan go and do the big dance finale (Johnny One Note Ballet).\n\nAct 2 opens on the gang sitting despondently trying to cheer each other up because they are at the work farm (Imagine). Val comes in and calls them away to lunch, staying behind to inform Billie that his parents will be away for 3-4 more months. They talk and Val mocks Billie's beliefs on luck and her immaturity (All at Once).\n\nFor the gang's first night off, the sheriff is throwing a party in a field on Val's property. The former communist Peter enters, having won money in a raffle, and proclaims that he is to travel the world and not share his money to which the gang is upset (Imagine Reprise). \nCut to a surprisingly long ballet dream sequence of his travels (Peter's Ballet). Continuing pre ballet he decides to invest the money (Imagine Reprise 2).\nLater at the party, the Sheriff attempts to make good with the kids. Billie tells Val that she plans on leaving The Farm for the road. Val insists on going with her before being called back to the kitchen. Billie sings about how she doesn't mind driving around. She also talks about how she likes living on her own terms (Lady is a Tramp).\n\nPeter returns to the party informing the crew that he lost all the money. The gang leaves following the radio for news of a cross atlantic flight and Deloris tells Gus that she will come work on the farm to be with him. He reacts by telling her how she doesn't return his affections and drags him along (You are so Fair). After pretending to not care about each other they admit that they like each other.\n\nThe gang re-enters and listen to the radio. They realise the Aviator must make a forced landing, and in their field nonetheless! After much scrambling, they call the airport to get reporters to come, and Val decides to impersonate the aviator. The reporters believe his impersonation and the city decides to throw the aviator a party. After concocting a scheme, Billie takes control of the unconscious and tied up aviator and relishes in the fact that the gang treats her as an equal (Lady is a Tramp Reprise).\n\nAt the party, the gang repeatedly interrupts the mayor introducing the aviator to delay it. Performing a variety of musical numbers (Specialty: You are so fair, Imagine, My Funny Valentine, Light on Our Feet, and Lady is a Tramp). After The Aviator successfully does the speech the entire chorus performs a rousing closing number (Finale Ultimo).\n\n==Original Broadway cast==\n* [[Mitzi Green]] as Billie Smith\n* [[Ray Heatherton]] as Val Lamar\n* [[Alfred Drake]] as Marshall Blackstone\n* Duke McHale as Peter Jackson\n* Wynn Murray as Baby Rose\n* Rolly Pickert as Gus Fielding\n* Grace McDonald as Dolores Reynolds\n* [[The Nicholas Brothers|Harold Nicholas]] as Ivor DeQuincy \n* [[The Nicholas Brothers|Fayard Nicholas]] as Irving DeQuincy\n* Dana Hardwick as Lee Calhoun\n* George Watts as Sheriff Reynolds\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nOverture [including the ''Lamars\u2019'' act and the ''Blackstones{{'}}'' act]\u2014Orchestra\n\n'''ACT I'''\n* \"Opening Act I\"\u2014Orchestra\n* \"[[Where or When]]\"\u2014Billie & Val\n* \"Babes in Arms\"\u2014Val, Marshall, Billie & The Gang\n* \"[[I Wish I Were in Love Again]]\"\u2014Gus & Dolores\n* \"Babes in Arms\u2014Reprise\"\u2014Marshall, Sheriff & The Gang\n* \"Light On Our Feet\" with dance (originally the racially insensitive \"All Dark People Are Light On Their Feet\")\u2014The DeQuincy Bros.\n* \"Way Out West\" with dance break\u2014Baby Rose & Men's Quartet\n* \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\"\u2014Billie\n* \"[[Johnny One Note]]\"\u2014Baby Rose\n* \"Ballet\u2014Johnny One Note\" including (Orchestra):\n** Section 1: Tango and Jazz Ballet\n** Section 2: The Scene Moves Backstage\n** Section 3: Move Back to Ballet\n** Section 4: Finale\u2014Act I\nEntr'acte\u2014Orchestra\n\n'''ACT II'''\n* \"Imagine\"\u2014Men's Quartet, Baby Rose, Peter, & Marshall\n* \"All At Once\"\u2014Val & Billie\n* \"Imagine\u2014Reprise #1\"\u2014Peter & The Men's Quartet\n* \"Peter's Journey (Ballet)\"\u2014Orchestra\n* \"Imagine\u2014Reprise #2\"\u2014The Men's Quartet & Peter\n* \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" with encore\u2014Billie\n* \"You Are So Fair\" with two dances\u2014Gus & Dolores with Orchestra\n* \"Reprise: The Lady Is a Tramp\"\u2014Billie\n* \"Specialty #1 (Light On Our Feet) & Specialty #2 (Imagine)\"\u2014Orchestra\n* \"Finale Ultimo\"\u2014The Gang with Val & Billie\n* \"Bows (Johnny One-Note)\"\u2014Orchestra\n* \"Exit Music (Where or When)\"\u2014Orchestra\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newworldrecords.org/liner_notes/80386.pdf Liner Notes to cast recording with detailed synopsis of original 1937 version]\n* [http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_b/babes_in_arms.htm Detailed synopsis of revised 1950s version]\n* [http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12218 Internet Broadway Database listing]\n* [http://www.lorenzhart.org/babes.htm \"Babes in Arms songs, plot, production notes\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101228225234/http://rnh.com/show_detail.asp?id=BA3 \"Babes in Arms\" production information, Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061130184420/http://www.thejudyroom.com/discography/soundtracks/babesbway.html The Judy Garland Online Discography \"Babes In Arms\" pages.]\n\n{{Rodgers and Hart}}\n\n[[Category:1937 musicals]]\n[[Category:Broadway musicals]]\n[[Category:Musicals by Rodgers and Hart]]\n[[Category:Original musicals]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1937 musical by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart}}\n{{for|the film adaptation|Babes in Arms (film)}}\n{{Infobox Musical\n|name=Babes in Arms \n|image=Babes_in_Arms_Logo.png\n|caption=Original Broadway Logo\n|music=[[Richard Rodgers]]\n|lyrics=[[Lorenz Hart]]\n|book=[[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]\n|basis=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Corp.]]\n|productions= 1937 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] <br> 1939 [[Babes in Arms (film)|film]] <br> 2007 [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]\n<!-- Please do not include production-specific (acting, directing, etc.) awards -->\n}}\n'''''Babes in Arms''''' is a 1937 [[musical theatre|musical]] comedy with music by [[Richard Rodgers]], lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]] and book by [[Rodgers and Hart]].

The original score was utilized along with several additional Rodgers and Hart songs. [[Randy Skinner]] choreographed the production.\n\n==Plot of original 1937 version==\n''Babes in Arms'' opens in Seaport, Rhode Island in the 1930s.

They then sing a love song about how they feel as though they have met before (Where or When).\n\nThe Sheriff then visits them to inform them that they have to work at the work farm because they are not yet 21. They then decide that they will stick around instead and find another way to support themselves (Babes in Arms). \nThe \u201ckids\u201d form a group with Val as the leader. After deciding nothing, except that violence is good, they disperse. Dolores, the Sheriff's daughter, talks to Gus, her ex, who tries to woo her, failing. They then sing and flirt about how they do not care that their relationship is over (I Wish I Were in Love Again).\n\nMarshall then arrives, jealous. Then Val enters mentioning that he has also kissed her, a fight begins and escalates when others enter. The sheriff comes in and the kids pretend to be dancing. This causes Val to decide to put on their own follies. The Sheriff decides to give them two weeks to put on the show (Babes in Arms Reprise).\n\nLater, Val enters and tells Irving and Ivor to practice their number (Light on Our Feet). Lee then arrives and chastises his brother, Beauregard, for hanging out with \u201cthe blacks\u201d. Billie then uses her womanly guiles to convince Lee to invest his money in the show. Lee then smears some of her lipstick on his cheek and convinces the boys that she kissed him. They then bring on \u201cBaby Rose\u201d a former child star to be in their show who performs a number she learned (Way Out West).\n\nBillie then enters with a jealous Val. After calming him, they discuss the show. Lee does not want Irving and Ivor in the show, After learning this, Val leaves in a huff. Billie reflects on her romance with Val (My Funny Valentine). They transition into the day of the show and show the final number of the follies performed by Baby Rose (Johnny One Note). Backstage, Lee and Val fight over letting Irving and Ivor go on despite their race. Val punches Lee and Irving and Ivan go and do the big dance finale (Johnny One Note Ballet).\n\nAct 2 opens on the gang sitting despondently trying to cheer each other up because they are at the work farm (Imagine). Val comes in and calls them away to lunch, staying behind to inform Billie that his parents will be away for 3-4 more months. They talk and Val mocks Billie's beliefs on luck and her immaturity (All at Once).\n\nFor the gang's first night off, the sheriff is throwing a party in a field on Val's property. The former communist Peter enters, having won money in a raffle, and proclaims that he is to travel the world and not share his money to which the gang is upset (Imagine Reprise). \nCut to a surprisingly long ballet dream sequence of his travels (Peter's Ballet).

Billie tells Val that she plans on leaving The Farm for the road. Val insists on going with her before being called back to the kitchen. Billie sings about how she doesn\u2019t mind driving around. She also talks about how she likes living on her own terms (Lady is a Tramp).\n\nPeter returns to the party informing the crew that he lost all the money. The gang leaves following the radio for news of a cross atlantic flight and Deloris tells Gus that she will come work on the farm to be with him. He reacts by telling her how she doesn\u2019t return his affections and drags him along (You are so Fair). After pretending to not care about each other they admit that they like each other.\n\nThe gang re-enters and listen to the radio. They realise the Aviator must make a forced landing, and in their field nonetheless! After much scrambling, they call the airport to get reporters to come, and Val decides to impersonate the aviator. The reporters believe his impersonation and the city decides to throw the aviator a party. After concocting a scheme, Billie takes control of the unconscious and tied up aviator and relishes in the fact that the gang treats her as an equal (Lady is a Tramp Reprise).\n\nAt the party, the gang repeatedly interrupts the mayor introducing the aviator to delay it.

Porter praised her delivery, professionalism, ability to memorize lyric changes, and said: \"She has the finest enunciation of any American singer I know.

The Committees appointed canvassers who were \"tactful and influential men\" not liable for service; many were experienced political agents.

A khaki armband bearing the Royal Crown was to be provided to all who had enlisted or who had been rejected, as well as to starred and discharged men (they were no longer issued or worn after compulsion was introduced).\n\nThe enlistee\u2019s data was copied onto a new white card which was used to assign him to one of 46 age groups consisting of married or unmarried men. They were promised that only entire groups would be called for active service and they would have fourteen days' advance notice. Single men's groups would be called before married; any who wed after the day the Scheme began were classified as single. Married men were promised that their groups would not be called if too few single men attested, unless conscription was introduced. The survey was done in November and December 1915. It obtained 318,553 medically fit single men.<ref>National Archives, CAB 37/140/1.</ref> However, 38% of single men and 54% of married men had publicly refused to enlist.\n\n==Conscription 1916\u201318==\nSince there were too few volunteers to fill the ranks, the [[Military Service Act (United Kingdom)|Military Service Bill]] was introduced in January 1916, providing for the conscription of single men aged 18\u201341. Every single man and childless widower between 18 and 41 was offered three choices:\n# Enlist at once.\n# Attest at once under Derby\u2019s system.\n# Or on 2 March 1916 be automatically deemed to have enlisted.\nIn May 1916 the bill was extended to married men and in April 1918 the upper age was raised to 50 (or to 56 if need arose). Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom at the time, was excluded from the scheme.\n\nAs Henderson had warned compulsion did not go smoothly. By July 1916 93,000 (30%) of those called had failed to appear, that summer and autumn likely-looking men in public places were rounded up.<ref>Beckett, 1988</ref> It was primarily a protest, since few of the no-shows could have hoped to escape, although a few were hidden by sympathizers.<ref>Rippon, N.

Barnsley: Wharncliffe Books, 2009.</ref>\n\nMen called up for military service or their employers could appeal to a civilian [[Military Service Tribunals|Military Service Tribunal]] in their town or district on the grounds of work of national importance, business or domestic hardship, medical unfitness, or [[conscientious objection]]. By the end of June 1916, 748,587 men had appealed.<ref>J.E. Edmonds, ''Military Operations: France and Belgium: 1916'', vol. i (London: 1932), p.152.</ref> The standards of the tribunals were capricious: in York a case was determined in an average of eleven minutes, two minutes was the rule at Paddington in London.<ref>Beckett, 1988, p.7.</ref>\n[[File:All ranks army size.jpg|thumb|size of British army during WW1.

Around 7,000 of them were granted non-combatant duties, while a further 3,000 ended up in special work camps. 6,000 were imprisoned. Forty two were sent to France to potentially face a firing squad. Thirty five were formally sentenced to death, but immediately reprieved, with ten years penal servitude substituted.\n\nMany of those appealing were given some kind of exemption, usually temporary (between a few weeks and six months) or conditional on their situation at work or home remaining serious enough to warrant their staying at home. In October 1916 1.12 million men held tribunal exemption or had cases pending,<ref>The National Archives, CAB 17/158, Derby scheme: Statement of the War Committee, 24 October 1916</ref> by May 1917 this had fallen to 780,000 exempt and 110,000 pending.

In the same month occupational exemptions were withdrawn for men 18 to 23, in October 1918 there were 2,574,860 men in reserved occupations. Men aged 18\u00bd were sent to the fronts starting in March 1918, violating a pledge to keep them safe until 19. There were also problems with men\u2019s suitability for active service. The healthy manpower was simply not there \u2013 recruits were sorted into three classes, A, B, and C, in order of fitness for front-line service. In 1918, 75 percent were classed as A, some B men also had to be sent into the trenches.\n\nThe upper limit on the number of men conscripted is usually calculated by assuming that all recruits after 1 March 1916 were conscripts: 1,542,807 men, 43.7% of those who served in the Army during the war. However, Derby had enlisted 318,553 single men in Special Reserve B, who were called up in spring 1916, which reduces the conscripted to 37%. The married men who had attested in the Derby plan are harder to categorize because they were not called up from the Reserve but swept up with the rest. It seems that somewhat less than 35% of the men in the army were compelled to serve.\n\n==Ireland==\n{{see also|Conscription Crisis of 1918|Ireland and World War I}}\nIn 1918, legislation intended to extend conscription to Ireland [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|was opposed]] by a broad movement of [[Irish nationalist]]s and the [[Catholic Church in Ireland]].

By July 1916 93,000 (30%) of those called had failed to appear, that summer and autumn likely-looking men in public places were rounded up.<ref>Beckett, 1988</ref> It was primarily a protest, since few of the no-shows could have hoped to escape, although a few were hidden by sympathizers.<ref>Rippon, N.

By the end of June 1916, 748,587 men had appealed.<ref>J.E.

Around 7,000 of them were granted non-combatant duties, while a further 3,000 ended up in special work camps. 6,000 were imprisoned. Forty two were sent to France to potentially face a firing squad. Thirty five were formally sentenced to death, but immediately reprieved, with ten years penal servitude substituted.\n\nMany of those appealing were given some kind of exemption, usually temporary (between a few weeks and six months) or conditional on their situation at work or home remaining serious enough to warrant their staying at home. In October 1916 1.12 million men held tribunal exemption or had cases pending,<ref>The National Archives, CAB 17/158, Derby scheme: Statement of the War Committee, 24 October 1916</ref> by May 1917 this had fallen to 780,000 exempt and 110,000 pending.

In the same month occupational exemptions were withdrawn for men 18 to 23, in October 1918 there were 2,574,860 men in reserved occupations. Men aged 18\u00bd were sent to the fronts starting in March 1918, violating a pledge to keep them safe until 19. There were also problems with men\u2019s suitability for active service. The healthy manpower was simply not there \u2013 recruits were sorted into three classes, A, B, and C, in order of fitness for front-line service. In 1918, 75 percent were classed as A, some B men also had to be sent into the trenches.\n\nThe upper limit on the number of men conscripted is usually calculated by assuming that all recruits after 1 March 1916 were conscripts: 1,542,807 men, 43.7% of those who served in the Army during the war. However, Derby had enlisted 318,553 single men in Special Reserve B, who were called up in spring 1916, which reduces the conscripted to 37%. The married men who had attested in the Derby plan are harder to categorize because they were not called up from the Reserve but swept up with the rest. It seems that somewhat less than 35% of the men in the army were compelled to serve.\n\n==Ireland==\n{{see also|Conscription Crisis of 1918|Ireland and World War I}}\nIn 1918, legislation intended to extend conscription to Ireland [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|was opposed]] by a broad movement of [[Irish nationalist]]s and the [[Catholic Church in Ireland]].

Fifteen years later, as predicted, Junior is a music teacher at Knickerbocker University. He has two talented students: Sidney Cohn and Frankie Frayne. Sidney has written a promising jazz ballet which Frankie catches Junior dancing to alone in the classroom (uncovering his \"secret past\"), and she trades an introduction to the Russian Ballet's manager in return for his listening to her song.\n\nIn the apartment of Vera Baranova, star of the Russian Ballet, Peggy, the manager, enthusiastically tells Sergei, the company's director, about the new jazz ballet. He is not interested in anything new - he doesn't even recognise that the Revolution has happened! Junior arrives as Vera and co-star/unfaithful lover Morrisone are having a Russian screaming match. The others leave, so that Vera and Junior can discuss the new ballet, but that leads to a new entanglement.\n\nBack in the classroom, Frankie is jealous of Junior's stories about Vera and the Russians (Peggy has promised him a chance to dance in the corps de ballet), and they both wish they were away from it all. At the opening of the ballet, ''La Princesse Zenobia'', Junior is told that one of the dancers is in jail and he must take his place, but onstage he gets all his steps, rhythms and positions cock-eyed and makes a laughing-stock of the ballet. But the audience loves it, nevertheless.\n\n;Act II\n\nSergei, Peggy, Vera, Morrosine and Junior have listened to the jazz ballet. Opinions are mixed, and Vera and Morrosine are still arguing, as he becomes increasingly jealous of Junior. Poor Junior has got love problems, too: he upsets Frankie by going to lunch with Vera (for business reasons) instead of her, but she is \"[[Glad to Be Unhappy]]\".\n\nThen Peggy, Sergei, and some of the company visit Junior's school. Sergei has come to break the bad news that he will not be doing the jazz ballet, but Peggy persuades him by threatening to pull out the million dollars she has put into the company. After Sergei's announcement that the next production will be ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'', the class stages the title number \"On Your Toes\", in which the students' jazz and the company's classical routines are deftly combined.\n\nAt a rehearsal, Morrosine's jealousy of Junior escalates, he fights with Sergei and is knocked\u2013out, suddenly making Junior the new star. The humiliated Morrosine plots with his gangster friend, Louie, to shoot Junior at the end of the performance. Joe, the stage doorman, overhears and warns Frankie. On-stage, Junior is tipped\u2013off and signals to the conductor to avoid the final loud climax which would cover the shot, so he keeps the orchestra playing the last few bars of the music over and over as Junior dances frantically to keep the shooter from firing until the police arrest him. After the curtain call, Frankie embraces Junior and is startled to see his parents waiting to congratulate him.

The ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' ballet does appear at the end of the film, with choreography by [[George Balanchine]], one of eight films for which he created the dances. Eddie Albert's character dances the lead in the ballet, opposite Zorina. According to John Reid, \"Albert is no dancer...But with the aid of a visual double for one or two shots plus post-synched taps, he actually manages rather well, and even duets with the great Zorina with reasonable facility.\"<ref>Reid, John.

The crystals have been scattered across a series of levels, the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, which Terry must conquer in order to win the game. The player navigates Terry through each Kingdom from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]] and can move in eight directions, as well as jump over enemies, obstacles, and holes. Enemies include fairies that have been transformed into insects and {{Cuegloss|Black ball|black balls}} by Baron von Bonsai.

The objective in each Kingdom is to collect all of the crystals and maneuver through hazards such as trap doors, slippery floors, magnet floors that prevent Terry from jumping, and pinball bumpers.

The level can also be restarted voluntarily, at the cost of five Manukas. When the Manuka counter reaches zero, the game ends.

The player controls Terry, a green bouncing sphere, on a quest to recover his magic crystals that have been stolen by Baron von Bonsai. To do so, he must travel through the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, avoiding enemies and hazards while collecting all of the crystals within the game's time limit. The game was developed by Dene Carter at Logotron, with sounds and music composed by [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]].\n\nMost editions were priced at \u00a324.99 upon their release, except for the Commodore 64 ports, which were less expensive. Reception for the Amiga version was generally positive, but was more mixed for the Commodore 64 port. Most reviews, however, praised the graphics and gameplay and criticized the difficulty and the amount of content that was available for the price. A less expensive re-release for Amiga computers a year later, at \u00a37.99, also received mixed reviews.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Cloudkingdoms crystal world c64.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot from the Commodore 64 version of ''Cloud Kingdoms'']]\n''Cloud Kingdoms'' is an arcade [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] where the player controls the character of Terry, a green bouncing sphere with eyes, in his quest to recover his magic crystals that were stolen by the game's antagonist, Baron von Bonsai. The crystals have been scattered across a series of levels, the eponymous Cloud Kingdoms, which Terry must conquer in order to win the game. The player navigates Terry through each Kingdom from a [[Video game graphics#Top-down perspective|top-down perspective]] and can move in eight directions, as well as jump over enemies, obstacles, and holes. Enemies include fairies that have been transformed into insects and {{Cuegloss|Black ball|black balls}} by Baron von Bonsai. There are 15 Kingdoms in the [[Commodore 64]] version and 32 in all others.<ref name=\"Zzap\">{{cite journal|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = [[Zzap!64]]|issue = 61|page = 14|publisher = [[Newsfield]]|location = [[Ludlow]]|date = May 1990}}</ref>\n\nPlayers begin the game with a preset choice of four Kingdoms to begin with, with each leading to four other kingdoms that are opened up once the level is won. The objective in each Kingdom is to collect all of the crystals and maneuver through hazards such as trap doors, slippery floors, magnet floors that prevent Terry from jumping, and pinball bumpers. The game overall has a time limit of 99 \"Manukas\", each of which is equivalent to approximately four seconds.<ref name=\"Zzap\"/> Contact with lava fields<ref name=\"PowerPlay\">{{cite journal|last = Locker|first = Anatol|title = Cloud Kingdoms|journal = Power Play|page = 102|publisher = [[Future plc]]|location = [[Bath, Somerset]]|date = June 1990|language=de}}</ref> or enemies drains the player's energy and, if all energy is lost, the level is reset and ten Manukas are subtracted from the remaining total. The level can also be restarted voluntarily, at the cost of five Manukas. When the Manuka counter reaches zero, the game ends. Collecting clocks will add five Manukas to the timer, while successfully completing a Kingdom will add twenty.
