Royapuram Rockers are on top of the chain and keep bashing the Sharks year after year. The heroes of the movie are the Sharks' team.\n\nThe story begins when Raghu's ([[Jai (actor)|Jai]]) parents move from Royapuram to Visalakshi Thottam, Chennai 600 028. Raghu is a member of the Royapuram Rockers Cricket team, and a college student living with his parents. He has no choice but to move with them although he detests the area. He is not very excited at the prospect of living in the same area as his sworn enemies. Raghu is faithful to his teammates, but they ignore him because of the distance. Angered at being replaced by a new guy in the team in one of the matches, Raghu estranges himself from cricket and the Rockers.\n\nRaghu informs of Pazhani's ([[Nithin Sathya]]) sister Selvi's ([[Vijayalakshmi (Tamil actress)|Vijayalakshmi]]) love for Karthik ([[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]]) to him. This incident initiates Raghu's friendship with a few Sharks team players and eventually gets induced into the team. Raghu practices with the Sharks to play against the Rockers in the upcoming Radio Mirchi trophy. Pazhani, who soon comes to know of his sister's and Karthik's love affair is disappointed and then there is a tiff amongst the friends. The team splits up for a while, but Karthik apologizes to Pazhani and they make up. The team is united again and they start practicing for the trophy once again. Unfortunately, Karthik gets stabbed by his brother's enemies and is rendered unfit to play the match. Pazhani replaces Karthik as the captain and the team heads for the match.\n\nUnder tight pressure and with a nail biting finish, the Sharks finally defeat the Rockers in the semi-finals of the tournament. In the finals they meet their enemies , a bunch of school kids named Bad Boys-II who practice by bunking school to play cricket on the beach. The kids are really good and the Sharks know it because they have lost to them once before and that too very badly...\n\nThe movie ends with the team really struggling to keep it up in the game.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jai (actor)|Jai]] as Raghuvaran \"Raghu\"\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Karthik\n* [[Premji Amaran|Premji]] as Seenivasan \"Seenu\"\n* [[Aravind Akash]] as Aravind\n* [[Nithin Sathya]] as Pazhani\n* [[Vijay Vasanth]] as Gopi\n* Ezhumalai as Ajay Raj\n* Prasanna as Shanmugham\n* Ranjith as Imran\n* Arun as Uday\n* Karthik as Arivazhagan \"Arivu\"\n* [[Sampath Raj]] as Guna\n* [[Ilavarasu]] as Manohar\n* [[Vijayalakshmi Ahathian|Vijayalakshmi]] as Selvi\n* Kristine Zedek as Swetha\n* [[Badava Gopi]] as Commentator\n* [[Sakthi Saravanan]] as Aravind's boss\n* [[Inigo Prabakaran]] as John (Rockers's captain)\n* [[Mai Prakash]] as Rocker's team player\n* Sundar as Jeeva\n* [[Viraj (actor)|Hari Prashanth]] as Hari, Bad Boys' captain\n* [[S.

Royapuram Rockers are on top of the chain and keep bashing the Sharks year after year. The heroes of the movie are the Sharks' team.\n\nThe story begins when Raghu's ([[Jai (actor)|Jai]]) parents move from Royapuram to Visalakshi Thottam, Chennai 600 028. Raghu is a member of the Royapuram Rockers Cricket team, and a college student living with his parents. He has no choice but to move with them although he detests the area. He is not very excited at the prospect of living in the same area as his sworn enemies. Raghu is faithful to his teammates, but they ignore him because of the distance. Angered at being replaced by a new guy in the team in one of the matches, Raghu estranges himself from cricket and the Rockers.\n\nRaghu informs of Pazhani's ([[Nithin Sathya]]) sister Selvi's ([[Vijayalakshmi (Tamil actress)|Vijayalakshmi]]) love for Karthik ([[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]]) to him. This incident initiates Raghu's friendship with a few Sharks team players and eventually gets induced into the team. Raghu practices with the Sharks to play against the Rockers in the upcoming Radio Mirchi trophy. Pazhani, who soon comes to know of his sister's and Karthik's love affair is disappointed and then there is a tiff amongst the friends. The team splits up for a while, but Karthik apologizes to Pazhani and they make up. The team is united again and they start practicing for the trophy once again. Unfortunately, Karthik gets stabbed by his brother's enemies and is rendered unfit to play the match. Pazhani replaces Karthik as the captain and the team heads for the match.\n\nUnder tight pressure and with a nail biting finish, the Sharks finally defeat the Rockers in the semi-finals of the tournament. In the finals they meet their enemies , a bunch of school kids named Bad Boys-II who practice by bunking school to play cricket on the beach. The kids are really good and the Sharks know it because they have lost to them once before and that too very badly...\n\nThe movie ends with the team really struggling to keep it up in the game.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jai (actor)|Jai]] as Raghuvaran \"Raghu\"\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Karthik\n* [[Premji Amaran|Premji]] as Seenivasan \"Seenu\"\n* [[Aravind Akash]] as Aravind\n* [[Nithin Sathya]] as Pazhani\n* [[Vijay Vasanth]] as Gopi\n* Ezhumalai as Ajay Raj\n* Prasanna as Shanmugham\n* Ranjith as Imran\n* Arun as Uday\n* Karthik as Arivazhagan \"Arivu\"\n* [[Sampath Raj]] as Guna\n* [[Ilavarasu]] as Manohar\n* [[Vijayalakshmi Ahathian|Vijayalakshmi]] as Selvi\n* Kristine Zedek as Swetha\n* [[Badava Gopi]] as Commentator\n* [[Sakthi Saravanan]] as Aravind's boss\n* [[Inigo Prabakaran]] as John (Rockers's captain)\n* [[Mai Prakash]] as Rocker's team player\n* Sundar as Jeeva\n* [[Viraj (actor)|Hari Prashanth]] as Hari, Bad Boys' captain\n* [[S.

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family.

French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31\u201332.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name=\"NO\">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west.

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Manufacturers in Indiana | publisher=Purdue University Center for Rural Development | date=July 19, 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Business===\n\nIn 2016, Indiana was home to seven [[Fortune 500]] companies with a combined $142.5 billion in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiana Businesses Shuffle on Fortune 500|first=Dan|last=McGowan|publisher=Inside Indiana Business|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/32221981/indiana-businesses-shuffle-around-on-fortune-500|date=June 14, 2016|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref> [[Columbus, Indiana|Columbus]]-based [[Cummins, Inc.]] and Indianapolis-based [[Eli Lilly and Company]] and [[Simon Property Group]] were recognized in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' publication's \"2017 World's Most Admired Companies List\", ranking in each of their respective industries.<ref>{{cite news|title=3 Indiana companies make Fortune's 2017 World's Most Admired Companies List|first=Allison|last=Carter|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/02/20/3-indiana-companies-make-fortunes-2017-worlds-most-admired-companies-list/98149374/|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Northwest Indiana]] has been the largest steel producing center in the U.S. since 1975 and accounted for 27 percent of American-made steel in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiana leads nation in steel production|first=Joseph|last=Pete|publisher=Northwest Indiana Times|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/business/steel/indiana-leads-nation-in-steel-production/article_def40810-528e-5a98-acc2-ebab79de08a2.html|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIndiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in Indianapolis, the state's largest corporation, as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wndu.com/news/112005/news_46007.php|title=WNDU-TV: News Story: Bayer is leaving Elkhart \u2013 November 16, 2005}}</ref> Overall, Indiana ranks fifth among all U.S. states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Economy & Demographics | publisher=Terre Haute Economic Development Co. | url=http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716101025/http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 16, 2006 | accessdate=January 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIndiana is within the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]].

The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway.

Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].

The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads.

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools.

On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]].

The [[Michigan Territory]] was established in 1805 from part of the Indiana Territory's northern lands and four years later, in 1809, the Illinois counties were separated from the Indiana Territory to create the [[Illinois Territory]].

The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. These new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Nock (arrow)|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Woodland period]] began around 1500 BC, when new cultural attributes appeared. The people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began to develop long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name=\"HIS\"/>\n\nThe [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 AD until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals.

French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans.\n\nBy 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]].\n\nIn 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.\n\nThe Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede to the British crown all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]].\n\nThe tribes in Indiana did not give up: they captured [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Native American use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called \"Indian Territory\".\n\nIn 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31\u201332.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name=\"NO\">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west.

About half the state was acquired in the [[Treaty of St. Mary's]] from the Miami in 1818. Purchases were not complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinewas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Native American lands in the northeast.\n\nA portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809)|Treaty of Fort Wayne]] in 1809, adding much of the southwestern lands around Vincennes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts such as Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincennes settlement on the lower Wabash. Other settlements included Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis would not be populated for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained wilderness populated primarily by Indigenous communities. Only two counties in the extreme southeast, Clark and Dearborn, had been organized by European settlers. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Settler migration was chiefly via flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and by wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).\n\nIn 1810, the [[Shawnee]] tribal chief [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and the purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Statehood and settlement===\n\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey Lester Jones, Photographer May 24, 1940.

The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises.

The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]]. Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].\n\n====Highways====\n\n[[File:I-69 Construction Indiana.jpg|thumb|The [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] extension project in [[Monroe County, Indiana|Monroe County]]]]\n\nThe major U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio\u2013Indiana\u2013Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.\n\nA $3 billion project extending I-69 is underway. The project was divided into six sections, with the first five sections (linking [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] to [[Martinsville, Indiana|Martinsville]]) now complete.

Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (for example, Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).\n\nThere are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g., Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.\n\nNotably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e., Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.\n\n====Rail====\n\n[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]]]]\n\nIndiana has more than 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is implementing an extensive rail plan prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].\n\n====Ports====\n\n[[File:Towboat Ben McCool upbound on Ohio River with two tank barges (1 of 6) 87j082.jpg|thumb|Barges are a common sight along the [[Ohio River]].

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution. In 1843 the Legislature ruled that African Americans could not attend the public schools, leading to the foundation of [[Union Literary Institute]] and other schools for them, funded by donations or the students themselves.\n\nAlthough the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.\n\nIndiana public schools have gone through several changes throughout Indiana's history. Modern, public school standards, have been implemented all throughout the state. These new standards were adopted in April 2014. The overall goal of these new state standards is to ensure Indiana students have the necessary skills and requirements needed to enter college or the workforce upon high school graduation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Academic Standards |url=https://www.doe.in.gov/standards |website=Indiana Department of Education |publisher=Indiana Department of Education |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}</ref> State standards can be found for nearly every major subject taught in Indiana public schools.

R. Ross of 1825 Garden Street, [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. He spent most of his early life in West Lafayette. About 1932, his family moved to a farm in [[Linden, Indiana|Linden]], [[Montgomery County, Indiana|Montgomery Country]], [[Indiana]]. He attended all four years in Linden High School and graduated in 1936.{{Sfn|Wilson|Winfrey|McDole|2012}} Malcolm Ross received a scholarship to attend [[Purdue University]] to study [[civil engineering]]. While at Purdue, he worked at the campus [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] as a [[Sports commentator|sports announcer]] and changed his major to [[creative writing]], [[communication]], and [[radio]]. However, Malcolm Ross graduated from Purdue in June 1941 with a BS in [[physics]]. After college, he married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Martin, and took [[broadcasting]] jobs in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Chicago]], and [[Indianapolis]].{{Sfn|Norberg|2003|p=289}}\n\nIn January 1943, Ross was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the United States Naval Reserve. After he completed two months training at the [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point|Quonset Point Naval Air Station]] in [[Rhode Island]], the Navy sent him to [[graduate school]] for nine months [[training]] in [[physics]] and general [[meteorology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. In June 1944, he completed the training with a professional certificate in meteorology and [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]].\n\nThe Navy initially assigned Ross to the Fleet Weather Center at [[Pearl Harbor]]. Later he served as the [[aerology]] officer aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'']] while it was flying missions against [[Tokyo]] and [[Iwo Jima]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]], from 1944 to 1945. Ross received a [[Service star|campaign star]] in his [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal|Pacific Theater Ribbon]] for the first [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] plane strike at Tokyo in February 1945 and for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima invasion]].\n\nAfter World War II ended, Ross was released from the military. He returned to civilian life and opened an [[advertising agency]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], where his wife, Marjorie, had moved during World War II. Marjorie worked in the agency as the [[Office management|office manager]]. The business continued successfully until June 1950, when Ross was recalled to [[active duty]] for the [[Korean War]] as a [[lieutenant]] in the United States Naval Reserve. Initially, Malcolm Ross was stationed as an instructor in radiological defense for the Naval Damage Control Training Center at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. From there he was able to commute home during weekends to spend time with his family and maintain the advertising business. This came to an end when in 1951 the Navy reassigned Ross to work as the [[liaison officer]] for the [[Office of Naval Research]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].\n\nThe Navy's unmanned balloon program, [[Skyhook balloon|Project Skyhook]], was based in Minneapolis, which was also a center of balloon research and development being carried out by the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[General Mills]].<ref name=\"AllHands1953\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah195312.pdf |title=Trip to Outer Space in Navy Skyhook |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 1953 |website=The Official Website of the United States Navy |publisher=Office of Navy Personnel (NAVPERS-O) |pages=10\u201311 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In 1953, Ross was transferred to the air branch of the [[Office of Naval Research|Office of Naval Research (ONR)]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as Balloon Projects Director.

He arranged for balloon launchings at [[Goodfellow Air Force Base]] in 1954 and 1955. He was a member of the scientific group that launched balloons for the ONR at [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan, Canada, and photographed the [[Solar eclipse of June 30, 1954|1954 eclipse of the sun]] from a Skyhook balloon over Minneapolis.\n\n[[File:ANCExplorer Malcolm Ross grave.jpg|thumb|Grave at Arlington National Cemetery]]\n\nDuring his tour as ONR's Balloon Projects Officer, Ross initiated the Navy's manned balloon program, [[Project Strato-Lab]], in 1954. The Strato-Lab program utilized the new plastic high-altitude balloons for upper atmosphere research. At this time, Ross became the first active duty military officer qualified and licensed as a [[Balloon Pilot Badge|free balloon pilot]] based solely on plastic balloon experience. Ross went on [[Individual Ready Reserve|inactive duty]] in 1955 as a [[Lieutenant Commander]] (USNR). As a physicist in the Air Branch of the ONR, Ross specialized in the physics of the upper atmosphere and participated in Strato-Lab flights both as a civilian and as a naval officer. As the key participant in Project Strato-Lab, he spent more than 100 hours with scientists and other balloonists making observations in the [[stratosphere]]. At the time of the record-setting flight in 1961, Malcolm Ross was a Commander in the Naval Reserve.\n\nIn 1957, Ross received the [[Navy League of the United States|Navy League's]] newly established Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress, and the [[Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award]]. In 1958, jointly with Lieutenant Commander Lewis, he received the [[Harmon Trophy|Harmon International Trophy (Aeronaut)]] for the November 8, 1956, record-breaking flight. In 1962, jointly with [[Victor Prather]], he received the Harmon Trophy again for the record-holding flight in 1961 to {{convert|21.5|mi|km}}. Ross never flew in balloons again after the 1961 flight, although he continued to advocate using balloons as relatively inexpensive platforms for scientific investigations.<ref>Shirley Thomas, ''Men of Space: Profiles of the Leaders in Space Research, Development, and Exploration'' p 136</ref>\n\nRoss retired from the US Naval Reserve as a captain on July 1, 1973. After leaving the Office of Naval Research, Malcolm Ross worked in [[space research]] at [[General Motors]]. Later on he became a stock brokerage executive for [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith, Inc.]] and served as assistant vice president and account executive at the [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] branch.\n\nRoss died at home in [[Birmingham, Michigan]], and is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

R. Ross of 1825 Garden Street, [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. He spent most of his early life in West Lafayette. About 1932, his family moved to a farm in [[Linden, Indiana|Linden]], [[Montgomery County, Indiana|Montgomery Country]], [[Indiana]]. He attended all four years in Linden High School and graduated in 1936.{{Sfn|Wilson|Winfrey|McDole|2012}} Malcolm Ross received a scholarship to attend [[Purdue University]] to study [[civil engineering]]. While at Purdue, he worked at the campus [[Radio broadcasting|radio station]] as a [[Sports commentator|sports announcer]] and changed his major to [[creative writing]], [[communication]], and [[radio]]. However, Malcolm Ross graduated from Purdue in June 1941 with a BS in [[physics]]. After college, he married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Martin, and took [[broadcasting]] jobs in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Chicago]], and [[Indianapolis]].{{Sfn|Norberg|2003|p=289}}\n\nIn January 1943, Ross was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the United States Naval Reserve. After he completed two months training at the [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point|Quonset Point Naval Air Station]] in [[Rhode Island]], the Navy sent him to [[graduate school]] for nine months [[training]] in [[physics]] and general [[meteorology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. In June 1944, he completed the training with a professional certificate in meteorology and [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]].\n\nThe Navy initially assigned Ross to the Fleet Weather Center at [[Pearl Harbor]]. Later he served as the [[aerology]] officer aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS ''Saratoga'']] while it was flying missions against [[Tokyo]] and [[Iwo Jima]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]], from 1944 to 1945. Ross received a [[Service star|campaign star]] in his [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal|Pacific Theater Ribbon]] for the first [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] plane strike at Tokyo in February 1945 and for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima invasion]].\n\nAfter World War II ended, Ross was released from the military. He returned to civilian life and opened an [[advertising agency]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], where his wife, Marjorie, had moved during World War II. Marjorie worked in the agency as the [[Office management|office manager]]. The business continued successfully until June 1950, when Ross was recalled to [[active duty]] for the [[Korean War]] as a [[lieutenant]] in the United States Naval Reserve. Initially, Malcolm Ross was stationed as an instructor in radiological defense for the Naval Damage Control Training Center at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. From there he was able to commute home during weekends to spend time with his family and maintain the advertising business. This came to an end when in 1951 the Navy reassigned Ross to work as the [[liaison officer]] for the [[Office of Naval Research]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].\n\nThe Navy's unmanned balloon program, [[Skyhook balloon|Project Skyhook]], was based in Minneapolis, which was also a center of balloon research and development being carried out by the [[University of Minnesota]] and [[General Mills]].<ref name=\"AllHands1953\">{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/archpdf/ah195312.pdf |title=Trip to Outer Space in Navy Skyhook |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 1953 |website=The Official Website of the United States Navy |publisher=Office of Navy Personnel (NAVPERS-O) |pages=10\u201311 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In 1953, Ross was transferred to the air branch of the [[Office of Naval Research|Office of Naval Research (ONR)]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as Balloon Projects Director.

He arranged for balloon launchings at [[Goodfellow Air Force Base]] in 1954 and 1955. He was a member of the scientific group that launched balloons for the ONR at [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan, Canada, and photographed the [[Solar eclipse of June 30, 1954|1954 eclipse of the sun]] from a Skyhook balloon over Minneapolis.\n\n[[File:ANCExplorer Malcolm Ross grave.jpg|thumb|Grave at Arlington National Cemetery]]\n\nDuring his tour as ONR's Balloon Projects Officer, Ross initiated the Navy's manned balloon program, [[Project Strato-Lab]], in 1954. The Strato-Lab program utilized the new plastic high-altitude balloons for upper atmosphere research. At this time, Ross became the first active duty military officer qualified and licensed as a [[Balloon Pilot Badge|free balloon pilot]] based solely on plastic balloon experience. Ross went on [[Individual Ready Reserve|inactive duty]] in 1955 as a [[Lieutenant Commander]] (USNR). As a physicist in the Air Branch of the ONR, Ross specialized in the physics of the upper atmosphere and participated in Strato-Lab flights both as a civilian and as a naval officer. As the key participant in Project Strato-Lab, he spent more than 100 hours with scientists and other balloonists making observations in the [[stratosphere]]. At the time of the record-setting flight in 1961, Malcolm Ross was a Commander in the Naval Reserve.\n\nIn 1957, Ross received the [[Navy League of the United States|Navy League's]] newly established Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award for Scientific and Technical Progress, and the [[Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award]]. In 1958, jointly with Lieutenant Commander Lewis, he received the [[Harmon Trophy|Harmon International Trophy (Aeronaut)]] for the November 8, 1956, record-breaking flight. In 1962, jointly with [[Victor Prather]], he received the Harmon Trophy again for the record-holding flight in 1961 to {{convert|21.5|mi|km}}. Ross never flew in balloons again after the 1961 flight, although he continued to advocate using balloons as relatively inexpensive platforms for scientific investigations.<ref>Shirley Thomas, ''Men of Space: Profiles of the Leaders in Space Research, Development, and Exploration'' p 136</ref>\n\nRoss retired from the US Naval Reserve as a captain on July 1, 1973. After leaving the Office of Naval Research, Malcolm Ross worked in [[space research]] at [[General Motors]]. Later on he became a stock brokerage executive for [[Merrill Lynch|Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith, Inc.]] and served as assistant vice president and account executive at the [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] branch.\n\nRoss died at home in [[Birmingham, Michigan]], and is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

The balloon touched down near [[Jamestown, North Dakota]]. Due to electrical failures in the ballast control system, they were unable to release additional ballast and impacted somewhat harder than they wished, perhaps 300 to 400 feet (90 to 120 m) per minute.

He was a member of the central committee of [[Maki (current political party)|Maki]] (the Israeli Communist Party and the largest faction within [[Hadash]]), an activist for socio-economic equality and an environmentalist.\n\n==Political career==\nSince 1990, Khenin has been a leading member of the [[Maki (political party)|Israeli Communist Party]]. During the elections for the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|16th Knesset]], he held the number four spot on the Hadash-Taal list. At the time, the party was only about 500 votes short in order for Khenin to be able to enter the Knesset. On January 14, 2006, Khenin placed third on the [[Hadash]] list, and was subsequently elected to the [[2006 Israeli legislative election|17th Knesset]].\n\nKhenin is currently a member of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, and he also heads the Knesset\u2019s joint committee on Environment and Health. Additionally, he served as chairman, alongside Knesset member Rabbi Michael Melchior, of the social-environmental lobby, the largest lobby in the 17th Knesset.\n\nIn the [[List of members of the eighteenth Knesset|18th Knesset]], Khenin headed the social-environmental lobby together with MK [[Nitzan Horowitz]].\n\n=== General positions ===\nOne of Khenin's main focuses is the rights of workers, saying in April 2014 that, \"the problem of low wages is the most critical of all. Not the price of cottage cheese and not even apartment prices\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Leftist Knesset member: Israelis want social justice but vote Netanyahu - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|url = http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/04/dov-khenin-hadash-left-wing-interview-social-justice.html|website = Al-Monitor|accessdate = 2016-01-05|language = en-us}}</ref> In 2014, he initiated legislation to increase the minimum wage from 23 NIS to 30 NIS.  This legislation received widespread, cross-party support, with backing from 61 of the 120 members of the [[19th Knesset]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.590712|title = Majority of MKs Back Raising Hourly Minimum Wage to $8.68|date = May 15, 2014|accessdate = |website = Haaretz.com|publisher = Haaretz|last = Zrahiya|first = Zvi}}</ref> In December 2014, the minimum wage for workers was raised to 27 NIS through a contract agreement between the [[Histadrut]] labor union and the [[Manufacturers Association of Israel]]. Dov welcomed the progress, but vowed to keep pushing towards his original goal of a 30 NIS minimum wage.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/minimum-wage-hike-agreed-averting-strike/|title = Minimum wage hike agreed, averting strike|date = December 12, 2014|accessdate = |website = Times of Israel|publisher = |last = Newman|first = Marissa}}</ref>\n\nKhenin also works to keep the influence of money out of politics, supporting the campaign against the privatization of Israel's natural gas resources.  In 2015, Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]'s cabinet voted to allow the development of natural gas harvesting off the coast of the Mediterranean sea. Khenin and other critics noted how this would give too much power to the American Nobel Energy group, as well as pose a conflict of interests to Netanyahu. In an effort to make the voting process more fair, Khenin along with MK [[Zehava Gal-On|Zehava Galon]] asked Attorney General [[Yehuda Weinstein]] to exclude the Prime Minister from voting on the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-overrides-antitrust-authority-on-natural-gas/|title = Cabinet overrides Antitrust Authority on natural gas|date = June 28, 2015|accessdate = |website = Times of Israel|publisher = Times of Israel|last = Beck|first = Jonathan}}</ref> Dov also participated in the large protests in response to the deal. At a protest in Haifa, Khenin said, \"this struggle is not only an economic struggle or a social struggle. It is also a struggle for democracy. There is no democracy where capital rules.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://maki.org.il/en/?p=6124|title = Violent Clashes during Gas Deal Protests in Tel Aviv, Beer-Sheva|date = November 9, 2015|accessdate = |website = Maki|publisher = Communist Party of Israel|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, Khenin is also a supporter of broader ecological legislation. In 2012, Dov proposed setting up an \"environmental court\" for the country.  He envisioned a court that would watch over the country's natural resources, as well as safeguard wildlife and ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4240483,00.html|title = 'Israel needs environmental court'|date = June 14, 2012|access-date = |website = Ynetnews|publisher = Ynet|last = Tzimuki|first = Tova}}</ref> Recognizing the municipality's lack of authority over traffic regulations, Khenin acted in 2008 to pass legislation that would have communities create their own policies. This legislation, aimed at allowing a more direct and local solution to automotive pollution problems, allows for effective public transportation changes to be implemented on the smaller scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.com/clean-air-act-puts-city-hall-in-the-driver-s-seat-1.239160|title = 'Clean Air Act' Puts City Hall in the Driver's Seat|access-date = |website = Haaretz|publisher = Haaretz|last = Rinat|first = Zafir}}</ref> Khenin also battled against industrial pollution in Haifa. In 2014, Khenin headed a subcommittee calling for stricter environmental standards to be imposed on Haifa's oil refineries located along its port. The panel showed a possible link between pollution from the refineries to increased risk of cancer among residents in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-1.608340|title = Knesset Panel: Haifa Oil Refineries Air Pollution Must Be Cut|date = Aug 1, 2014|access-date = |website = Haaretz|publisher = Haaretz|last = Rinat|first = Zafrir}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to past conflicts with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], Khenin is clear that the fault is on Israel. During [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Operation Protective Edge]], Khenin showed vehement opposition to the war, placing complete blame on Prime Minister Netanyahu.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Leftist Knesset member blames Netanyahu for Gaza war - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|url = http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/dov-khenin-israeli-left-anti-war-demonstration-hamas-gaza.html#|website = Al-Monitor|accessdate = 2016-01-05|language = en-us}}</ref> During the summer of 2014 Khenin spoke out against the operation both in the political and social sphere. At a protest in Tel Aviv, Khenin asked a crowd of 7,000, \"we must answer truthfully: Has a drop of all this bloodshed really helped bring us to a better place?\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|title = Thousands of Israelis Protest Gaza War in Rare Outpouring for Peace|url = http://forward.com/news/israel/202897/thousands-of-israelis-protest-gaza-war-in-rare-out/|website = The Forward|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Mayoral campaign ===\nIn 2008, Khenin was the mayoral candidate for the ''Ir Lekhulanu'' (\"City for All\") party. The party was supported by the Jaffa Jewish-Arab list ''Yafa'' (whose partners are [[Balad (political party)|Balad]] and [[Hadash]]) and endorsed by the [[Green Movement (Israel)|Green Movement]]<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.city4all.org.il/english The endorsement is in: Dov Khenin and \u201cCity for All\u201d for the Tel Aviv Municipal Elections]</ref> in Tel Aviv's 2008 municipal election. Khenin's platform was largely focused on improving civil infrastructure. Public transportation, housing, as well as education equality and ecology were focuses of his campaign. Khenin also ran on a concept of promoting communities within Tel Aviv, saying in an interview, \"the most important thing in the city is not the streets and the buildings, but the people and the communities.\"<ref>{{cite interview |last=Khenin |first=Dov |subject-link=Dov Khenin |interviewer=Jesse Fox |title=An Interview with Dov Khenin |url=http://www.sustainablecityblog.com/2008/11/an-interview-with-mk-dov-khenin-candidate-for-mayor-of-tel-aviv/ |date=November 7, 2008 |access-date=}}</ref> Khenin lost the election with 34.3% of the vote to incumbent mayor [[Ron Huldai]], who got 50.6% of the vote.

Over the years, the fund has developed a range of activities for aiding children and youth at risk, and its activity has garnered widespread praise. The fund was initially established under a temporary order that was due to expire at the end of 2007.

The law contains advanced mechanisms for the economic punishment of polluters, including both administrative and criminal penalties. It increases the punishment meted out to bodies that pollute without a pollution permit and also establishes a collection mechanism for bodies that pollute within the framework of the law. This mechanism is intended to encourage factories to switch to cleaner technologies.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Knesset|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/heb/OneResDoc.asp?Type=3&LawNum=196&SubNum=1}}</ref>\n* ''Clean Air Law'' \u2013 The law was approved in the first reading by the 16th Knesset, and was reformulated in the 17th Knesset with MK Khenin's active involvement. This is a comprehensive law that fully regulates, for the first time in Israel, the issue of the discharge of pollutants into the air, tightening the ring around polluting industries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ynet- Knesset passes Clean Air Act|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3572107,00.html}}</ref>\n* ''Environmental Enforcement Law'' \u2013 Confers broad search and investigation powers on inspectors of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and for the first time subjects the different security bodies to civil enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Knesset|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/18/379.rtf}}</ref>\n* ''Environmental Enforcement Law'' \u2013 Powers of Local Authority Inspectors \u2013 Empowers local authorities to enforce environmental laws, thereby simultaneously achieving two important goals \u2013 the one, environmental (increasing enforcement of environmental laws), and the other, social (injecting fine moneys collected from environmental polluters directly into the coffers of the local authorities whose residents are the main victims of pollution).\n* ''Law to Reduce Air Pollution from Transportation (Amendment 84 to the Traffic Ordinance)'' \u2013 The law creates a clear division of power between the government and the local authorities, putting an end to an impossible situation in which either side could paralyze initiatives of the other. The amendment obligates local authorities to act to reduce air pollution caused by transportation in every case where there is a high level of air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Knesset|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/Laws/Data/law/2135/2135.pdf}}</ref>\n* ''Environmental Transparency Law'' \u2013 Duty to Report the Discharge of Pollutants \u2013 The law establishes a requirement of transparency over the discharge of pollutants into the environment, imposes on factories detailed reporting duties, sets up a register of discharged pollutants and mandates the publication of the data to the public. Experience has shown that environmental reporting duties change the behavior of polluting factories and that environmental transparency is a major democratic tool for mobilizing the public to act against pollution and pollutants. Evasion of reporting will be a criminal offense and will also result in significant administrative-financial penalties.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Knesset|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/privatelaw/data/18/3221.rtf}}</ref>\n* ''Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings'' \u2013 Establishes a comprehensive mechanism for reducing energy use in the public sector. Among other measures, every public institution must follow a defined plan for the reduction of energy consumption. The law also lists a series of energy-saving measures, including the installation of energy-efficient light bulbs, replacement of electricity-guzzling equipment and implementation of a procedure for the economic use of electric equipment.

Subsequently, a government bill was submitted that adopted the main points of these bills. The law, which is predicated on the principle of \"the polluter pays,\" provides for extended producer responsibility for the treatment and reduction of electronic waste that can cause soil and groundwater contamination, and makes arrangements for the collection and recycling of purchased appliances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recycling Portal- Recycling electronic waste: Knesset approves law|url=http://www.recyclingportal.eu/artikel/29034.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==== Animal protection ====\n* ''Prohibition on Import of Animal-Tested Cosmetics and Detergents''&nbsp;\u2013 The law prohibits importing into Israel cosmetic/cleaning products, not for health purposes, and detergents that were tested on animals during their production.

New kinds of poverty become widespread, the middle strata deteriorate, and social safety nets are being eroded\".<ref>quoted  [from dov's page on the Knesset website http://m.knesset.gov.il/mk/Pages/MKPersonalDetails.aspx?MKID=780]</ref> As a politician who is considered to be committed to Socialist values, Khenin legislated dozens of social laws, and stood many times in support of [[organized labor|workers struggles]]. Yet, he made it clear on numerous occasions, that his support for Socialism does not mean uncritical support of the model that existed in the Soviet Union. In an article he published in the Communist Party's weekly newspaper in 1991, as the USSR and the East-European Socialist countries were collapsing, Khenin wrote that what is needed is \"neither social-democracy nor stalinism, but a modern and revolutionary Left, that can truly advance the Socialist challenge\"<ref>quoted [http://www.dovblog.org/manifesto from Dov's personal blog]</ref>\n\n===Supporting peace===\nKhenin was active in the [[Israeli peace movement|peace movement]] since an early age, and was one of the first protesters against the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. Since his election to the [[Knesse]]t, he continued to express criticism towards the wars in Gaza and towards the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 Second Lebanon War]]. In his opinion, \"for Israel, achieving peace is an existential necessity. If Israel will not find a way to live with its neighbors in the great [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] region in which we live, we don't have a future here. A true Israeli-Palestinian peace needs to guarantee justice and independence of both peoples, and should give to the Palestinian people what the people in Israel already have: an independent state\". \n<ref>[http://m.knesset.gov.il/mk/Pages/MKPersonalDetails.aspx?MKID=780]</ref>\n\n===Supporting Jewish-Arab partnership===\nAs a teenager, Khenin was a member of a joint Jewish-Arab youth movement, and as a student he was active in a joint Jewish-Arab student club called CAMPUS. Having been elected to the Knesset on the list of [[Hadash]], and afterwards in the [[Joint List]], he continued to stress that Jewish-Arab partnership is a cornerstone in his worldview: \"The reality in Israel continues to separate between Jews and Arabs, yet the interest of both our peoples lies in creating a partnership that would transform this country into a just and secure place for all. Clearly, Jewish-Arab partnership means swimming against the tide, both among Jews as well as among Arabs. Yet we must swim against the tide of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]], and I am certain, that if we work right, we can also change its direction\". \n<ref>[http://m.knesset.gov.il/mk/Pages/MKPersonalDetails.aspx?MKID=780]</ref>\n\n===Relation to Marxism and communism===\nAs a teenager, Dov Khenin was member of the Young Communist League of Israel, and afterwards joined the ranks of the [[Communist Party of Israel]] and was elected to its leading bodies. In the late 1980s, he harshly criticized the \"deformations in the [[Soviet]] regime, which are the result of [[Stalinism]]\". He defined Stalinism as a terrible deformation of the Communist ideal \n,<ref>[http://www.dovblog.org/%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95/]</ref> and in an interview in 2009 he said that \"I believe Stalin was the worst disaster of 20th-century Socialism. But I still believe in the ideal of transforming our world\". He added that \"Communism, for me, is a form of horizon: It is a different kind of society, a different kind of division between people... Capitalism wants to establish the rule of profit over everything in life: economy, education, health, the environment. Socialism means the opposite: to try and free as many of these domains from the rule of profit. The Socialism that I aspire to means liberating politics from big capital, and expanding democracy to encompass all walks of life\".<ref>[[:he:%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=July 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MKlink|id=780}}\n*[http://city4all.org.il/dovkhenin Dov Khenin] Ir LeKhulanu\n*[http://greenprophet.com/2008/09/05/2539/dov-khenin-green-tel-aviv/ Dov Khenin] Green Prophet\n*[http://www.dovblog.org/dov/category/english/ DovBlog] Khenin's official website\n\n{{Current MKs}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khenin, Dov}}\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Hadash politicians]]\n[[Category:Israeli communists]]\n[[Category:Israeli people of Belarusian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Israeli political scientists]]\n[[Category:Jewish Israeli politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006\u20132009)]]\n[[Category:Members of the 18th Knesset (2009\u20132013)]]\n[[Category:Members of the 19th Knesset (2013\u20132015)]]\n[[Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015\u20132019)]]\n[[Category:People from Petah Tikva]]\n[[Category:Tel Aviv University alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{advert|date=March 2019}}\n{{autobiography|date=March 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox member of the Knesset\n| image= Dovkhenin.jpg\n| image_size=150px\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1958|1|10|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Petah Tikva]], [[Israel]]\n| Year of Aliyah =\n| death_date =\n| Knesset(s) = [[2006 Israeli legislative election|17]], [[2009 Israeli legislative election|18]], [[2013 Israeli legislative election|19]], [[2015 Israeli legislative election|20]]\n| party1 = [[Hadash]]\n| partyyears1 = 2006\u20132015\n| minister1 =\n|party2 = [[The Joint List]]\n|partyyears2 = 2015\u20132019}} \n'''Dov Boris Khenin''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05d3\u05d1 \u05d7\u05e0\u05d9\u05df}}; born 10 January 1958) is an Israeli political scientist, lawyer, and former member of the [[Knesset]] for the [[Joint List]]. He was a member of the central committee of [[Maki (current political party)|Maki]] (the Israeli Communist Party and the largest faction within [[Hadash]]), an activist for socio-economic equality and an environmentalist.\n\n==Political career==\nSince 1990, Khenin has been a leading member of the [[Maki (political party)|Israeli Communist Party]]. During the elections for the [[2003 Israeli legislative election|16th Knesset]], he held the number four spot on the Hadash-Taal list. At the time, the party was only about 500 votes short in order for Khenin to be able to enter the Knesset. On January 14, 2006, Khenin placed third on the [[Hadash]] list, and was subsequently elected to the [[2006 Israeli legislative election|17th Knesset]].\n\nKhenin is currently a member of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, and he also heads the Knesset\u2019s joint committee on Environment and Health. Additionally, he served as chairman, alongside Knesset member Rabbi Michael Melchior, of the social-environmental lobby, the largest lobby in the 17th Knesset.\n\nIn the [[List of members of the eighteenth Knesset|18th Knesset]], Khenin headed the social-environmental lobby together with MK [[Nitzan Horowitz]].\n\n=== General positions ===\nOne of Khenin's main focuses is the rights of workers, saying in April 2014 that, \"the problem of low wages is the most critical of all. Not the price of cottage cheese and not even apartment prices\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Leftist Knesset member: Israelis want social justice but vote Netanyahu - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|url = http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/04/dov-khenin-hadash-left-wing-interview-social-justice.html|website = Al-Monitor|accessdate = 2016-01-05|language = en-us}}</ref> In 2014, he initiated legislation to increase the minimum wage from 23 NIS to 30 NIS.  This legislation received widespread, cross-party support, with backing from 61 of the 120 members of the [[19th Knesset]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.590712|title = Majority of MKs Back Raising Hourly Minimum Wage to $8.68|date = May 15, 2014|accessdate = |website = Haaretz.com|publisher = Haaretz|last = Zrahiya|first = Zvi}}</ref> In December 2014, the minimum wage for workers was raised to 27 NIS through a contract agreement between the [[Histadrut]] labor union and the [[Manufacturers Association of Israel]].

In 2015, Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]]'s cabinet voted to allow the development of natural gas harvesting off the coast of the Mediterranean sea. Khenin and other critics noted how this would give too much power to the American Nobel Energy group, as well as pose a conflict of interests to Netanyahu. In an effort to make the voting process more fair, Khenin along with MK [[Zehava Gal-On|Zehava Galon]] asked Attorney General [[Yehuda Weinstein]] to exclude the Prime Minister from voting on the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-overrides-antitrust-authority-on-natural-gas/|title = Cabinet overrides Antitrust Authority on natural gas|date = June 28, 2015|accessdate = |website = Times of Israel|publisher = Times of Israel|last = Beck|first = Jonathan}}</ref> Dov also participated in the large protests in response to the deal. At a protest in Haifa, Khenin said, \"this struggle is not only an economic struggle or a social struggle. It is also a struggle for democracy. There is no democracy where capital rules.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://maki.org.il/en/?p=6124|title = Violent Clashes during Gas Deal Protests in Tel Aviv, Beer-Sheva|date = November 9, 2015|accessdate = |website = Maki|publisher = Communist Party of Israel|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, Khenin is also a supporter of broader ecological legislation. In 2012, Dov proposed setting up an \"environmental court\" for the country.  He envisioned a court that would watch over the country's natural resources, as well as safeguard wildlife and ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4240483,00.html|title = 'Israel needs environmental court'|date = June 14, 2012|access-date = |website = Ynetnews|publisher = Ynet|last = Tzimuki|first = Tova}}</ref> Recognizing the municipality's lack of authority over traffic regulations, Khenin acted in 2008 to pass legislation that would have communities create their own policies. This legislation, aimed at allowing a more direct and local solution to automotive pollution problems, allows for effective public transportation changes to be implemented on the smaller scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.com/clean-air-act-puts-city-hall-in-the-driver-s-seat-1.239160|title = 'Clean Air Act' Puts City Hall in the Driver's Seat|access-date = |website = Haaretz|publisher = Haaretz|last = Rinat|first = Zafir}}</ref> Khenin also battled against industrial pollution in Haifa. In 2014, Khenin headed a subcommittee calling for stricter environmental standards to be imposed on Haifa's oil refineries located along its port. The panel showed a possible link between pollution from the refineries to increased risk of cancer among residents in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-1.608340|title = Knesset Panel: Haifa Oil Refineries Air Pollution Must Be Cut|date = Aug 1, 2014|access-date = |website = Haaretz|publisher = Haaretz|last = Rinat|first = Zafrir}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to past conflicts with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], Khenin is clear that the fault is on Israel. During [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Operation Protective Edge]], Khenin showed vehement opposition to the war, placing complete blame on Prime Minister Netanyahu.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Leftist Knesset member blames Netanyahu for Gaza war - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|url = http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/08/dov-khenin-israeli-left-anti-war-demonstration-hamas-gaza.html#|website = Al-Monitor|accessdate = 2016-01-05|language = en-us}}</ref> During the summer of 2014 Khenin spoke out against the operation both in the political and social sphere.

In an article he published in the Communist Party's weekly newspaper in 1991, as the USSR and the East-European Socialist countries were collapsing, Khenin wrote that what is needed is \"neither social-democracy nor stalinism, but a modern and revolutionary Left, that can truly advance the Socialist challenge\"<ref>quoted [http://www.dovblog.org/manifesto from Dov's personal blog]</ref>\n\n===Supporting Peace===\nKhenin was active in the [[israeli peace movement|peace movement]] since an early age, and was one of the first protesters against the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. Since his election to the [[Knesse]]t, he continued to express criticism towards the wars in Gaza and towards the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 Second Lebanon War]]. In his opinion, \"for Israel, achieving peace is an existential necessity. If Israel will not find a way to live with its neighbors in the great [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] region in which we live, we don't have a future here. A true Israeli-Palestinian peace needs to guarantee justice and independence of both peoples, and should give to the Palestinian people what the people in Israel already have: an independent state\". \n<ref>[http://m.knesset.gov.il/mk/Pages/MKPersonalDetails.aspx?MKID=780]</ref>\n\n===Supporting Jewish-Arab Partnership===\nAs a teenager, Khenin was a member of a joint Jewish-Arab youth movement, and as a student he was active in a joint Jewish-Arab student club called CAMPUS. Having been elected to the Knesset on the list of [[Hadash]], and afterwards in the [[Joint List]], he continued to stress that Jewish-Arab partnership is a cornerstone in his worldview: \"The reality in Israel continues to separate between Jews and Arabs, yet the interest of both our peoples lies in creating a partnership that would transform this country into a just and secure place for all. Clearly, Jewish-Arab partnership means swimming against the tide, both among Jews as well as among Arabs. Yet we must swim against the tide of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]], and I am certain, that if we work right, we can also change its direction\". \n<ref>[http://m.knesset.gov.il/mk/Pages/MKPersonalDetails.aspx?MKID=780]</ref>\n\n===Relation to Marxism and Communism===\nAs a teenager, Dov Khenin was member of the Young Communist League of Israel, and afterwards joined the ranks of the [[Communist Party of Israel]] and was elected to its leading bodies. In the late 1980s, he harshly criticized the \"deformations in the [[Soviet]] regime, which are the result of [[Stalinism]]\". He defined Stalinism as a terrible deformation of the Communist ideal \n,<ref>[http://www.dovblog.org/%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95/]</ref> and in an interview in 2009 he said that \"I believe Stalin was the worst disaster of 20th-century Socialism. But I still believe in the ideal of transforming our world\". He added that \"Communism, for me, is a form of horizon: It is a different kind of society, a different kind of division between people... Capitalism wants to establish the rule of profit over everything in life: economy, education, health, the environment. Socialism means the opposite: to try and free as many of these domains from the rule of profit. The Socialism that I aspire to means liberating politics from big capital, and expanding democracy to encompass all walks of life\".<ref>[[:he:%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=July 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MKlink|id=780}}\n*[http://city4all.org.il/dovkhenin Dov Khenin] Ir LeKhulanu\n*[http://greenprophet.com/2008/09/05/2539/dov-khenin-green-tel-aviv/ Dov Khenin] Green Prophet\n*[http://www.dovblog.org/dov/category/english/ DovBlog] Khenin's official website\n\n{{Current MKs}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khenin, Dov}}\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Hadash politicians]]\n[[Category:Israeli communists]]\n[[Category:Israeli people of Belarusian-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Israeli political scientists]]\n[[Category:Jewish Israeli politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006\u20132009)]]\n[[Category:Members of the 18th Knesset (2009\u20132013)]]\n[[Category:Members of the 19th Knesset (2013\u20132015)]]\n[[Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015\u20132019)]]\n[[Category:People from Petah Tikva]]\n[[Category:Tel Aviv University alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePolitical positions:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Khenin"}

She is a very pretty, loving, caring, and shy [[rag doll]] who told Jack that Christmas and Halloween shouldn't be mixed. She is originally patched together by Doctor Finkelstein. Sally is the only one to have doubts about Jack's Christmas plan. Although her creator attempts to keep her constantly imprisoned, she often manages escape by slipping him deadly nightshade, causing him to fall asleep. Nightshade is a flower that grows atop the grave of a dead witch, as seen before Jack's first song which induces temporary somnolence upon consumption. This becomes essential to Sally managing to trick the Doctor and escape. Despite her makeshift appearance, Sally is a determined individual with a good feel for what is right. [[Fiona Apple]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on the 2006 special edition of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', while [[Amy Lee]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on ''[[Nightmare Revisited]]''. She also appears in ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''.<ref>Ed. H. Leigh Davis, \"Sally,\" ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge Official Strategy Guide'' (Indianapolis: Pearson Education, 2006), 6.</ref>\n\nSally is a [[rag doll]]-type character, with detachable limbs stuffed with fall leaves. She often falls apart, requiring her to sew herself back together, and carries a set of sewing needles and thread for precisely that purpose. She was created by [[Doctor Finklestein]], Halloween Town's resident [[mad scientist]], as a companion. Their relationship is rather tense, as Finklestein insists on keeping Sally under lock and key, under the pretext of protecting her from the excitement of the outside world. However Sally is restless, and is intrigued by the wonders of the outside world.\n\nIt is this restlessness, or, more specifically, this desire for something better in her life, that draws her to [[Jack Skellington]]. In the beginning of the movie, she idolizes and admires Jack much like any of the other female members of Halloween Town; however, she quickly discovers that they are connected by the desire for something more in their lives, and her feelings for him intensify. The two refer to each other as \"friends\", though Jack seems unaware of Sally's true feelings for him, as she is too shy to make them known to him other than through her sweet actions, however this could be argued because after Boogie's defeat, Jack and Sally are left alone and Jack sees that Sally tried her best to help him. Thus prompting him to finally realize how much she cares for him and how much he loves her in return.\n\nOn the album to the film it is mentioned that years later Sandy Claws returned to Halloween Town and saw that Jack now had four or five skeleton children of his own. Many fans of the film and of the franchise assume that given the ending to the film, that Jack and Sally eventually got married and had a family of their own.\n\nBryan Theiss declares that \"Sally is one of those rare fantasy characters we can relate to on a certain level as much as we can to real-world characters on a more literal level.\"<ref>Bryan Theiss, ''The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiQLs-6SocC&pg=PA35&dq=Sally+%22Nightmare+Before+Christmas%22+greatest+characters#v=onepage&q=&f=false 35].</ref>\n\nSally's voice was played by [[Catherine O'Hara]] throughout the movie,<ref name=\"clute\"/><ref name=\"beck\"/> and [[Kath Soucie]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Oogie Boogie===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Oogie Boogie\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ken Page]]\n| species     = [[Bogeyman]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Oogie Boogie''' (voiced by [[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]] in all of his appearances<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\">Jerry Beck, ''The Animated Movie Guide: The Ultimate Illustrated Reference to Cartoon, Stop-motion, And Computer-generated Feature Films'' (Chicago Review Press, 2005), p.

The character resembles a large burlap sack; when Oogie Boogie is defeated, it is revealed that he is a colony of bugs wrapped in sacking.\n\nOogie Boogie did not appear in Tim Burton's original poem, but Burton later sketched a portrait of what appeared to be a potato sack man with horrible things inside.<ref name=\"NBC\">{{cite book |title=Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas |last=Thompson |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Thompson|year=1993 |publisher=Disney Enterprises |location=114 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York |isbn=0-7868-5378-6 |page=67}}</ref> The Oogie puppet was two feet high, twice the height of the other puppets.<ref name=\"NBC\"/> In his autobiography ''Burton on Burton'', Burton says that Oogie Boogie was loosely inspired by [[Cab Calloway]]'s 1932 appearance in a [[Betty Boop]] cartoon, and that he asked [[Danny Elfman]] to make Oogie's song in ''Nightmare'' slightly resemble Calloway's 1931 recording of the song \"[[Minnie the Moocher]]\". Elfman ended up referencing the [[Betty Boop]] cartoon ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933), also featuring Calloway; Santa's line \"Well, what are you going to do?\" and Oogie Boogie's response of \"I'm gonna do the best I can!\" are direct quotes from this cartoon. Another idea for Oogie's identity was for him to be Dr. Finklestein in disguise, gaining revenge on Jack and Sally, but it was not pursued past storyboards since Tim Burton scrapped the idea. This is visible on the Special Edition DVD.\n\nDespite the fact that Oogie is separated for the most part from the other inhabitants of Halloween Town, it appears they still allow him to take part in their celebration (most likely due to the Bogeyman's popular depiction of being involved with nightmares), as his shadow makes an appearance on the moon (before it dissolves into bats) in the opening musical \"[[This Is Halloween]]\" as \"the shadow on the moon at night, filling your dreams to the brim with fright.\" (In the version of \"This Is Halloween\" that was heard on ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', a different voice was heard when it came to the shadow on the moon part.) He, meanwhile, lives in an underground lair full of torture devices, each of which features a casino-like appearance, suggesting an addiction to gambling (this is enforced by his use of dice). Red skeletons \u2013 implied to be the remains of previous victims \u2013 are in several of the devices, and overhanging chains are used as perches by skeletal bats. Oogie Boogie's lair, during his theme song, is lit with [[black light]]s in the style of a cheap funhouse. Under these, Oogie himself [[Fluorescence|glows bright green]], similar to a [[glow stick]]. After the lights dim, however, the bright color is sapped from his lair, transforming its appearance into that of a dank, cellar-like dungeon. Above his lair is the clubhouse of [[#Lock, Shock and Barrel|Lock, Shock, and Barrel]], who feed him bugs regularly via a metal chute. It is at first believed that Oogie cannot be killed or die but it is later revealed he can if his brain, the lead bug, is destroyed. In the movie, Lock, Shock and Barrel kidnap [[#Santa Claus|Santa Claus]] and (against the wishes of Jack, who holds Oogie in great contempt) send him down to Oogie Boogie's lair, where he is bound to a giant [[roulette]] wheel. According to deleted song material (found in the soundtrack version), Oogie plans to add \"Sandy Claws\" to his new and \"special batch of Snake and Spider Stew\", \"to add a little Spice\". Sally, after finding out Santa's fate, attempts to rescue him but is captured herself. Oogie then tortures and tries to kill Sally and Santa Claus, but is foiled by Jack, who eventually pulls a thread loose from him, which rips off the sack covering him and causes the majority of his bugs to fall into the lava pit. The lead bug is then squashed by Santa after it falls next to the pit. The rest of the bugs scurry off after this.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie's origins and the birth of his rivalry with Jack were revealed. As it turns out, he once had his own holiday named Bug Day that was (most likely) forgotten by the people of the real world and thus vanished. Oogie escaped, found Halloween Town, and decided that it would be the new Bug Day. He and his army of [[insect]]s invaded the town and nearly took it over. Jack found out and he defeated the bugs and Oogie. Oogie survived the battle, learned to fear the Pumpkin King, and was imprisoned within his underground lair of which Jack warns that if Oogie ever leave his lair, it would be \"game over!\" for him (Oogie). Oogie complied, but secretly vowed revenge.\n\nIn the 2004 video game ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie is resurrected by his henchmen Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who sew him back together. He quickly deceives the residents of Halloween Town and tricks the townspeople into making traps for Jack, stating that Jack wouldn't return if they don't make an even scarier Halloween for next year. Oogie then attempts to become the Seven Holidays King, successfully kidnaps the real leaders, and tries to murder Santa Claus again. His plans are foiled by Jack. Desperate, Oogie puts up a fight in the Holiday Trash Hill (where all the holiday worlds' garbage goes) by turning into a gigantic junk-filled version of himself named \"Mega-Oogie.\" He is again destroyed when his bugs come out of him.\n\nOogie also appears with other [[Disney Villains]] at Halloween events such as the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]] at [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the ''[[HalloWishes]]'' and ''[[Halloween Screams]]'' fireworks shows at the [[Magic Kingdom]] and Disneyland, respectively, ''[[World of Color|World of Color: Villainous]]'' at [[Disney California Adventure]], and during the \"[[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]]\",  \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party]]\", and \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party|Oogie Boogie Bash]]\" separate-admission (\"hard ticket\") events.\n\nOogie Boogie also appears in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' as a member of [[Maleficent]]'s team of Disney villains. He appears again in the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' where he attempts to turn Santa Claus into a Heartless, and in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as an enemy based on Sora's memories of him.\n\n===Doctor Finklestein===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Doctor Finklestein\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] (film)<br/>[[Jess Harnell]] (video games)\n| species     = Humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Doctor Finklestein''' is a resident of Halloween Town. He is the [[mad scientist]] and the \"father\" of Sally. He is described as a pale-as-a-sheet mad scientist with a duckbill-like mouth and a hinged skullcap that he can open up to reveal his brain. For unknown reasons, he uses a motorized [[wheelchair]] (early drawings of Finklestein depict him standing freely and his original [[action figure]] followed this example, implying he was not always intended to be a wheelchair user). Finklestein is only referred to as the \"Evil Scientist\" in the credits. His true name is only mentioned in the movie when the Mayor calls him up to the front of the line for his Christmas assignment.\n\nDoctor Finklestein lives in a large observatory with his living rag doll creation Sally<ref>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' That's twice this month since you slipped deadly nightshade in my tea and run off.<br/>'''Sally:''' (''correcting him'') Three times.<br/>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' You're mine, you know! I made you! With my own hands...<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\"> (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')</span></ref> and his hunchbacked assistant Igor. [[James Whale]]'s [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] is quoted in Finklestein's line \"I made you with my own hands\" which is ironic as Finklestein's body appears to be largely if not entirely artificial. Unlike Frankenstein who takes no responsibility for his creations and disowns them almost as soon as they are completed (much like the original [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]), Finklestein takes full responsibility over Sally and acts as an over-protective father and in some ways an overbearing husband (thus explaining Sally's attempts to run away) by keeping her under lock and key under the pretext of sheltering her from the world. In addition to being an overbearing and antagonistic father figure for Sally to overcome, Finklestein also has a hand in helping [[Jack Skellington]] (of whom he seems to be very fond) with his plan to take over Christmas by bringing to life several skeletal [[reindeer]] to pull Jack's [[sleigh]]. At the end of the film, Finklestein, deciding that Sally is too much of a handful, creates a wife for himself using a portion of his own brain.\n\nDr. Finklestein is featured in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''. When Jack is tired of doing the same thing at Halloween, Dr. Finklestein helps him by giving him the Soul Robber, a weapon that allows Jack to change its shape. Jack also tells Dr. Finklestein to watch over the town while he is away. After Oogie Boogie's revival, Dr. Finklestein was under Oogie's control by switching his brain to a different one and created monsters that obey Oogie Boogie's every command. When Jack confronted Dr. Finklestein and found that his brain has been switched, he started a plan to get rid of it by using the \"sleeping soup\" that Sally gave him. Jack was able to put Dr. Finklestein's original brain back in place making Dr. Finklestein break from Oogie's control. In the game spin-offs, Finklestein's name is pronounced \"steen\" instead of \"stein\". For some reason, his wife creation \"Jewel\" is not present in the game, and Sally appears to still be living with him even though in the movie she appeared to be free at the end. Sally even says \"He insists on keeping me locked up\" while next to the Hanging Tree in the Graveyard.\n\nFinklestein also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and other games in the series. When the Heartless appear in Halloween Town, Jack thinks of adding them to the Halloween celebrations and asks Dr. Finklestein for advice. Realizing that the Heartless need a heart, the two find the ingredients for one: pulse and emotion (terror, fear, hope, and despair). Their initial experiment fails, and Dr. Finklestein sends Jack off with [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Sora|Sora]] and the gang to retrieve two more ingredients, memory and surprise, thus completing the heart. However, the heart is stolen by Oogie Boogie. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', created from Sora's memories, Dr. Finklestein creates a potion that allows people to see their true memory. The only problem is that once he sniffed the potion, Heartless appeared. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' Finklestein creates an experiment aided by Lock, Shock, and Barrel. As the Experiment has no heart, it goes on a rampage to steal gifts, in an attempt to understand the emotions behind giving and gain a heart of its own. Sadly, Sora and the gang have no choice but to destroy the Experiment.\n\nDr. Finklestein was voiced by [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] in the film<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jess Harnell]] in the video game spin-offs. His Japanese voice is provided by [[Y\u016bji Mitsuya]].\n\n===Mayor of Halloween Town===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = The Mayor of Halloween Town\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice = [[Glenn Shadix]] (film, ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', ''Oogie's Revenge'')<br/>[[Jeff Bennett]] (''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'')\n| species     = Two-faced humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''The [[Mayor]] of Halloween Town''' is depicted as a short, fat man, who has the appearance of a giant [[candy corn]] with a cone-shaped head, wearing an impossibly tall [[top hat]], a spider [[bolo tie]], and a ribbon of office that says \"Mayor\" on it. His cone-shaped head has two faces: One face is peach-skinned, rosy-cheeked, and smiling while the other face is white-skinned, pale and frowning with pointed teeth. Depending on the Mayor's mood, his head swivels around to display the right face with a loud clicking sound. When not in use, the other face has its eyes closed and is considered dormant. This split personality is likely inspired by a literal interpretation of the phrase \"two-faced politicians\".\n\nDespite his office, the Mayor apparently has very little actual authority in the day-to-day running of the town, or has very little confidence in his leadership skills, especially in planning for [[Halloween]]. This is attested when he arrives at [[Jack Skellington]]'s house to discuss some plans with him, not knowing that Jack is not home. When Jack does not answer, the Mayor quickly gets hysterical and yells, more to himself than anyone, \"Jack, please, I'm only an ''elected'' official here! I can't make decisions by myself!\". Nonetheless, the Mayor seems to enjoy his position. He apparently owns the only automobile in town, a [[hearse]]-like car called the \"Mayor-mobile\" that is equipped with a loudspeaker for making announcements and a black cat-shaped hood ornament that sounds a siren when its tail is cranked. The Mayor supports Jack and helps him in his quest to bring his own version of [[Christmas]] to the world, despite his secret misgivings about it. When Jack is apparently killed by the [[United States Army|US Army]], the Mayor openly admits he had a bad feeling about \"this Christmas thing\" and sorrowfully goes off in his Mayor-mobile to make the announcement throughout Halloween Town and the surrounding countryside that \"the king of Halloween has been blown to smithereens\". Later, he is told by Lock, Shock, and Barrel that Jack is in over his head and alive, and comes to retrieve him and Sally after Oogie Boogie has been defeated. The Mayor of Halloween Town is among the citizens surprised (and once again uneasy) when it starts snowing in Halloween Town, but when he catches a snowflake on his tongue, his head swivels around to reveal his pleased expression.\n\nThe Mayor of Halloween Town appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. His role in both games is fairly minor. In the first game, he helps Jack and Sora find an ingredient they need for the heart Dr. Finklestein is making. In the second game, he tries to stop two Heartless outbreaks by yelling at the Heartless through his megaphone, but has no success.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', the Mayor is seen in the opening cut scene congratulating Jack on another \"horrible\" Halloween. He is later seen in the level \"Mayor's Madhouse\" where Jack rescues him from a cage hanging from the roof of his house. While Jack goes to Christmas Town, the Mayor frees the other holiday leaders.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]] in the film, ''Oogie's Revenge'', and ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''Kingdom Hearts''. His Japanese voice actor is [[T\u014dru \u014chira]].\n\n===Lock, Shock and Barrel===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Lock, Shock, and Barrel\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Paul Reubens]] (Lock)<br/> [[Catherine O'Hara]] (Shock)<br/> [[Danny Elfman]] (Barrel) \n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Lock, Shock, and Barrel''' are introduced as [[#Oogie Boogie|Oogie Boogie]]'s \"little henchmen\", being 6, 7 and 5 years old respectively. The trio are not very loyal to Oogie, as they are simply making mischief both for their own fun and to stay on his good side (in other words, they serve him out of fear) and after his death they just have harmless fun, which they seem to enjoy more. However, this is contrasted by their lack of common sense as, presumably due to their lust for mischief they have shown no protest when their master was revived in the spinoffs, and once out of boredom revived him themselves in \"[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge|Oogie's Revenge]]\". They all three are [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treaters]], with masks similar to their faces (e.g. Barrel's skeleton mask is large and round to fit his face, with a huge grin on it like his near-permanent creepy smile). Their names are a play on the phrase, \"[[wiktionary:lock, stock and barrel|lock, stock, and barrel]].\" Though not totally antagonistic, they are usually the comedy relief. They appear to be Anti-heroes or merely neutral characters, as they'll work for most of those who summon them.\n\n* '''Lock''' is the leader of Oogie's Boys, but does not always think through things thoroughly and just likes to be in charge. Lock wears a red [[devil]] costume; his tail is a real devil's tail, his [[teeth]] are pointed sharply. His face is narrow and long-jawed with angular features, and his red and brown [[hair]] is formed into two [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] making him, literally, a handsome devil. He likes to think highly of himself and gets upset when others insult him or take the lead; however, he goes along with others' ideas if he fails to come up with anything himself.\n* '''Shock''' is the only female of Oogie's henchmen. She is the oldest, and the most cunning and intelligent of the three. She has some [[contempt]] for the other two and their supposed stupidity, although she often gets tired with them. Shock wears a purple witch costume with an elongated hat and she sometimes carries a broomstick. She has a high-pitched girl's voice, green skin, a pointed nose, and purple wirey hair. She often takes the lead in many plans and likes to be right.\n* '''Barrel''' - is Oogie's \"star pupil,\" presumably the youngest, and considered the stupidest of the three troublemakers, despite his protests to the contrary. He is the butt of many jokes made by his friends, but usually gets even through his own tricks which he always gets away with. Barrel wears a skeleton costume and has deformed feet and almost always carries an orange and black lolipop, otherwise resembling a small human boy, albeit one with white [[human skin|skin]], sunken [[human eye|eye]]s, and perfectly coiffed green hair. His face is round and has a perpetual grin, except when he is angry or scared. Barrel usually pilots the walking bathtub the trio use as transport. He also unintentionally bothers [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] when asking him a number of annoying questions. Often he gets left out of things because he is forever falling over his own deformed feet and he is sometimes slow to catch on.\n\nInstructing them to \"leave that no-account [[Oogie Boogie]] OUT of this!\" (they promise to do so, but cross their fingers behind their backs), [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel to \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\" (the Halloween Town residents' mistaken name for [[Santa Claus]]). At first, they accidentally capture the [[Easter Bunny]], whereupon Jack tells them to apologize and sends them back. They then capture their true quarry, and Jack takes Santa's hat. The trio then take Santa Claus to Oogie's lair, where Oogie taunts and threatens Santa. Once Jack has defeated Oogie and rescued Santa Claus, a hatch above opens and Lock, Shock, and Barrel appear now protagonists, having led the [[Mayor (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Mayor]] to Oogie's lair to find them.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie Boogie sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel out to nab the new \"Pumpkin King.\" They come back with Sally instead, saying she looked like Jack in the dark. Throughout the game, they are behind most of the ruckus going on around town ranging from poisoning the [[acid]] pools, driving the [[leech]]es crazy, knocking down the town's [[street light|street lamps]], luring Jack into [[death]] traps, and helping Oogie in the final battle.\n\nIn ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel decide to revive Oogie Boogie when they learn that Jack is temporarily leaving Halloween Town. In the game, Jack encounters the three one by one. In chapter 15, the threesome try to stop Jack a final time in their mobile bathtub on top of the Mayor of Halloween Town's house. He defeats them yet they spring a trap and drop him into a [[maze]] in Oogie's lair. They do not appear again in the game afterwards.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', after hearing Jack speak of a heart that can control the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Heartless]], Oogie sends the three out to steal the heart as part of his plan to take over Halloween Town. After the three are defeated by [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], they confess that Oogie made them do it. Later in the game, they comment how quiet Halloween Town has become without Oogie and consider making a ruckus just to liven things up. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', the three found a Heartless and raised it before it became too big for them to control.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel start off working as [[Doctor Finklestein]]'s (Not very obedient) lab assistants, until they encounter [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], who revives Oogie Boogie for them and gives them the \"Prison Keeper\" Heartless to hold off Sora and company. The monster keeps the children in a cage underneath its body, but swallows one of them to act as its \"pilot\", each giving the monster a different ability and appearance, ultimately swallowing all three of them attacking [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and party with its full repertoire. After its defeat, the trio run off saying it was 'fun' and unintentionally reveal Oogie's return. In the second visit, the three are accused of stealing presents after they enter Santa's workshop and are caught looking through gifts. Sora and the party have to fight these mischievous rascals by knocking them unconscious and putting them in boxes. In the end, the three claim that they did not steal the presents as they regard Christmas toys to be boring while revealing that they were actually looking for parts for Doctor Finklestein's Experiment. They also cause mischief as obstacles in the \"Making Presents\" mini game, before and after the fight with the Experiment. After the battle, they run off and are not seen again in the game.\n\nDespite having apparently reformed at the end of the film in later appearances, they have reverted to being antagonist. This suggests that they like working for Oogie Boogie more than being good.\n\nIn the movie, Lock was voiced by [[Paul Reubens]], Shock was voiced by [[Catherine O'Hara]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Danny Elfman]].<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> In the Kingdom Hearts series, Lock was voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], Shock was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].

In order to do so, Jack orders Lock, Shock, and Barrel to kidnap Santa on [[Christmas Eve]] so Jack can take his place for the Christmas season. The three then take Santa to Oogie Boogie where the holiday figure's life is threatened. A last minute rescue helps save not only Santa, but the entire holiday of Christmas as well. Santa Claus manages to round up the living gifts and replace them with the right ones. Santa Claus is last seen flying over Halloween Town as snow starts to fall.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie Boogie targets Santa Claus and leaves him hanging over the tracks for his scissor-tipped Oogie Train to drop him. Santa Claus was saved by Jack Skellington. When Oogie Boogie hijacked Santa's sleigh, Jack lets him use the same sleigh he used when Jack tried to improvise Christmas.\n\nSanta Claus appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy meet Santa Claus when they follow Jack Skellington to Christmas Town. He also made a reference about how Jack Skellington tried to improvise Christmas.

When Sora defeats Oogie Boogie, Santa Claus tells Jack that he should concentrate on Halloween and Santa should concentrate on Christmas. He also tells Sora to believe that he will meet Riku again. Later on, Santa's presents get stolen by Dr. Finklestein's Experiment. He helps Jack make decoy presents to attract the Experiment. Jack and company get them back by hiding in a decoy present. After they defeat the Experiment, Santa Claus decides to give Jack a taste of what it's like to deliver Christmas presents.

She is a very pretty, loving, caring, and shy [[rag doll]] who told Jack that Christmas and Halloween shouldn't be mixed. She is originally patched together by Doctor Finkelstein. Sally is the only one to have doubts about Jack's Christmas plan. Although her creator attempts to keep her constantly imprisoned, she often manages escape by slipping him deadly nightshade, causing him to fall asleep. Nightshade is a flower that grows atop the grave of a dead witch, as seen before Jack's first song which induces temporary somnolence upon consumption. This becomes essential to Sally managing to trick the Doctor and escape. Despite her makeshift appearance, Sally is a determined individual with a good feel for what is right. [[Fiona Apple]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on the 2006 special edition of ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', while [[Amy Lee]] provides the vocals for \"Sally's Song\" on ''[[Nightmare Revisited]]''. She also appears in ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''.<ref>Ed. H. Leigh Davis, \"Sally,\" ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge Official Strategy Guide'' (Indianapolis: Pearson Education, 2006), 6.</ref>\n\nSally is a [[rag doll]]-type character, with detachable limbs stuffed with fall leaves. She often falls apart, requiring her to sew herself back together, and carries a set of sewing needles and thread for precisely that purpose. She was created by [[Doctor Finklestein]], Halloween Town's resident [[mad scientist]], as a companion. Their relationship is rather tense, as Finklestein insists on keeping Sally under lock and key, under the pretext of protecting her from the excitement of the outside world. However Sally is restless, and is intrigued by the wonders of the outside world.\n\nIt is this restlessness, or, more specifically, this desire for something better in her life, that draws her to [[Jack Skellington]]. In the beginning of the movie, she idolizes and admires Jack much like any of the other female members of Halloween Town; however, she quickly discovers that they are connected by the desire for something more in their lives, and her feelings for him intensify. The two refer to each other as \"friends\", though Jack seems unaware of Sally's true feelings for him, as she is too shy to make them known to him other than through her sweet actions, however this could be argued because after Boogie's defeat, Jack and Sally are left alone and Jack sees that Sally tried her best to help him. Thus prompting him to finally realize how much she cares for him and how much he loves her in return.\n\nOn the album to the film it is mentioned that years later Sandy Claws returned to Halloween Town and saw that Jack now had four or five skeleton children of his own. Many fans of the film and of the franchise assume that given the ending to the film, that Jack and Sally eventually got married and had a family of their own.\n\nBryan Theiss declares that \"Sally is one of those rare fantasy characters we can relate to on a certain level as much as we can to real-world characters on a more literal level.\"<ref>Bryan Theiss, ''The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide'' (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiQLs-6SocC&pg=PA35&dq=Sally+%22Nightmare+Before+Christmas%22+greatest+characters#v=onepage&q=&f=false 35].</ref>\n\nSally's voice was played by [[Catherine O'Hara]] throughout the movie,<ref name=\"clute\"/><ref name=\"beck\"/> and [[Kath Soucie]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Oogie Boogie===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Oogie Boogie\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ken Page]]\n| species     = [[Bogeyman]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Oogie Boogie''' (voiced by [[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]] in all of his appearances<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\">Jerry Beck, ''The Animated Movie Guide: The Ultimate Illustrated Reference to Cartoon, Stop-motion, And Computer-generated Feature Films'' (Chicago Review Press, 2005), p.

The character resembles a large burlap sack; when Oogie Boogie is defeated, it is revealed that he is a colony of bugs wrapped in sacking.\n\nOogie Boogie did not appear in Tim Burton's original poem, but Burton later sketched a portrait of what appeared to be a potato sack man with horrible things inside.<ref name=\"NBC\">{{cite book |title=Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas |last=Thompson |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Thompson|year=1993 |publisher=Disney Enterprises |location=114 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York |isbn=0-7868-5378-6 |page=67}}</ref> The Oogie puppet was two feet high, twice the height of the other puppets.<ref name=\"NBC\"/> In his autobiography ''Burton on Burton'', Burton says that Oogie Boogie was loosely inspired by [[Cab Calloway]]'s 1932 appearance in a [[Betty Boop]] cartoon, and that he asked [[Danny Elfman]] to make Oogie's song in ''Nightmare'' slightly resemble Calloway's 1931 recording of the song \"[[Minnie the Moocher]]\". Elfman ended up referencing the [[Betty Boop]] cartoon ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'' (1933), also featuring Calloway; Santa's line \"Well, what are you going to do?\" and Oogie Boogie's response of \"I'm gonna do the best I can!\" are direct quotes from this cartoon. Another idea for Oogie's identity was for him to be Dr. Finklestein in disguise, gaining revenge on Jack and Sally, but it was not pursued past storyboards since Tim Burton scrapped the idea. This is visible on the Special Edition DVD.\n\nDespite the fact that Oogie is separated for the most part from the other inhabitants of Halloween Town, it appears they still allow him to take part in their celebration (most likely due to the Bogeyman's popular depiction of being involved with nightmares), as his shadow makes an appearance on the moon (before it dissolves into bats) in the opening musical \"[[This Is Halloween]]\" as \"the shadow on the moon at night, filling your dreams to the brim with fright.\" (In the version of \"This Is Halloween\" that was heard on ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', a different voice was heard when it came to the shadow on the moon part.) He, meanwhile, lives in an underground lair full of torture devices, each of which features a casino-like appearance, suggesting an addiction to gambling (this is enforced by his use of dice). Red skeletons \u2013 implied to be the remains of previous victims \u2013 are in several of the devices, and overhanging chains are used as perches by skeletal bats. Oogie Boogie's lair, during his theme song, is lit with [[black light]]s in the style of a cheap funhouse. Under these, Oogie himself [[Fluorescence|glows bright green]], similar to a [[glow stick]]. After the lights dim, however, the bright color is sapped from his lair, transforming its appearance into that of a dank, cellar-like dungeon. Above his lair is the clubhouse of [[#Lock, Shock and Barrel|Lock, Shock, and Barrel]], who feed him bugs regularly via a metal chute. It is at first believed that Oogie cannot be killed or die but it is later revealed he can if his brain, the lead bug, is destroyed. In the movie, Lock, Shock and Barrel kidnap [[#Santa Claus|Santa Claus]] and (against the wishes of Jack, who holds Oogie in great contempt) send him down to Oogie Boogie's lair, where he is bound to a giant [[roulette]] wheel. According to deleted song material (found in the soundtrack version), Oogie plans to add \"Sandy Claws\" to his new and \"special batch of Snake and Spider Stew\", \"to add a little Spice\". Sally, after finding out Santa's fate, attempts to rescue him but is captured herself. Oogie then tortures and tries to kill Sally and Santa Claus, but is foiled by Jack, who eventually pulls a thread loose from him, which rips off the sack covering him and causes the majority of his bugs to fall into the lava pit. The lead bug is then squashed by Santa after it falls next to the pit. The rest of the bugs scurry off after this.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie's origins and the birth of his rivalry with Jack were revealed. As it turns out, he once had his own holiday named Bug Day that was (most likely) forgotten by the people of the real world and thus vanished. Oogie escaped, found Halloween Town, and decided that it would be the new Bug Day. He and his army of [[insect]]s invaded the town and nearly took it over. Jack found out and he defeated the bugs and Oogie. Oogie survived the battle, learned to fear the Pumpkin King, and was imprisoned within his underground lair of which Jack warns that if Oogie ever leave his lair, it would be \"game over!\" for him (Oogie). Oogie complied, but secretly vowed revenge.\n\nIn the 2004 video game ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie is resurrected by his henchmen Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who sew him back together. He quickly deceives the residents of Halloween Town and tricks the townspeople into making traps for Jack, stating that Jack wouldn't return if they don't make an even scarier Halloween for next year. Oogie then attempts to become the Seven Holidays King, successfully kidnaps the real leaders, and tries to murder Santa Claus again. His plans are foiled by Jack. Desperate, Oogie puts up a fight in the Holiday Trash Hill (where all the holiday worlds' garbage goes) by turning into a gigantic junk-filled version of himself named \"Mega-Oogie.\" He is again destroyed when his bugs come out of him.\n\nOogie also appears with other [[Disney Villains]] at Halloween events such as the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]] at [[Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo Disneyland]], the ''[[HalloWishes]]'' and ''[[Halloween Screams]]'' fireworks shows at the [[Magic Kingdom]] and Disneyland, respectively, ''[[World of Color|World of Color: Villainous]]'' at [[Disney California Adventure]], and during the \"[[Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party]]\",  \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party]]\", and \"[[Mickey's Halloween Party|Oogie Boogie Bash]]\" separate-admission (\"hard ticket\") events.\n\nOogie Boogie also appears in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' as a member of [[Maleficent]]'s team of Disney villains. He appears again in the sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' where he attempts to turn Santa Claus into a Heartless, and in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as an enemy based on Sora's memories of him.\n\n===Doctor Finklestein===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Doctor Finklestein\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] (film)<br/>[[Jess Harnell]] (video games)\n| species     = Humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Doctor Finklestein''' is a resident of Halloween Town. He is the [[mad scientist]] and the \"father\" of Sally. He is described as a pale-as-a-sheet mad scientist with a duckbill-like mouth and a hinged skullcap that he can open up to reveal his brain. For unknown reasons, he uses a motorized [[wheelchair]] (early drawings of Finklestein depict him standing freely and his original [[action figure]] followed this example, implying he was not always intended to be a wheelchair user). Finklestein is only referred to as the \"Evil Scientist\" in the credits. His true name is only mentioned in the movie when the Mayor calls him up to the front of the line for his Christmas assignment.\n\nDoctor Finklestein lives in a large observatory with his living rag doll creation Sally<ref>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' That's twice this month since you slipped deadly nightshade in my tea and run off.<br/>'''Sally:''' (''correcting him'') Three times.<br/>'''Doctor Finklestein :''' You're mine, you know! I made you! With my own hands...<span style=\"font-size: 90%;\"> (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')</span></ref> and his hunchbacked assistant Igor. [[James Whale]]'s [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] is quoted in Finklestein's line \"I made you with my own hands\" which is ironic as Finklestein's body appears to be largely if not entirely artificial. Unlike Frankenstein who takes no responsibility for his creations and disowns them almost as soon as they are completed (much like the original [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]), Finklestein takes full responsibility over Sally and acts as an over-protective father and in some ways an overbearing husband (thus explaining Sally's attempts to run away) by keeping her under lock and key under the pretext of sheltering her from the world. In addition to being an overbearing and antagonistic father figure for Sally to overcome, Finklestein also has a hand in helping [[Jack Skellington]] (of whom he seems to be very fond) with his plan to take over Christmas by bringing to life several skeletal [[reindeer]] to pull Jack's [[sleigh]]. At the end of the film, Finklestein, deciding that Sally is too much of a handful, creates a wife for himself using a portion of his own brain.\n\nDr. Finklestein is featured in ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge''. When Jack is tired of doing the same thing at Halloween, Dr. Finklestein helps him by giving him the Soul Robber, a weapon that allows Jack to change its shape. Jack also tells Dr. Finklestein to watch over the town while he is away. After Oogie Boogie's revival, Dr. Finklestein was under Oogie's control by switching his brain to a different one and created monsters that obey Oogie Boogie's every command. When Jack confronted Dr. Finklestein and found that his brain has been switched, he started a plan to get rid of it by using the \"sleeping soup\" that Sally gave him. Jack was able to put Dr. Finklestein's original brain back in place making Dr. Finklestein break from Oogie's control. In the game spin-offs, Finklestein's name is pronounced \"steen\" instead of \"stein\". For some reason, his wife creation \"Jewel\" is not present in the game, and Sally appears to still be living with him even though in the movie she appeared to be free at the end. Sally even says \"He insists on keeping me locked up\" while next to the Hanging Tree in the Graveyard.\n\nFinklestein also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and other games in the series. When the Heartless appear in Halloween Town, Jack thinks of adding them to the Halloween celebrations and asks Dr. Finklestein for advice. Realizing that the Heartless need a heart, the two find the ingredients for one: pulse and emotion (terror, fear, hope, and despair). Their initial experiment fails, and Dr. Finklestein sends Jack off with [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Sora|Sora]] and the gang to retrieve two more ingredients, memory and surprise, thus completing the heart. However, the heart is stolen by Oogie Boogie. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'', created from Sora's memories, Dr. Finklestein creates a potion that allows people to see their true memory. The only problem is that once he sniffed the potion, Heartless appeared. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' Finklestein creates an experiment aided by Lock, Shock, and Barrel. As the Experiment has no heart, it goes on a rampage to steal gifts, in an attempt to understand the emotions behind giving and gain a heart of its own. Sadly, Sora and the gang have no choice but to destroy the Experiment.\n\nDr. Finklestein was voiced by [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] in the film<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jess Harnell]] in the video game spin-offs. His Japanese voice is provided by [[Y\u016bji Mitsuya]].\n\n===Mayor of Halloween Town===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = The Mayor of Halloween Town\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice = [[Glenn Shadix]] (film, ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', ''Oogie's Revenge'')<br/>[[Jeff Bennett]] (''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'')\n| species     = Two-faced humanoid\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''The [[Mayor]] of Halloween Town''' is depicted as a short, fat man, who has the appearance of a giant [[candy corn]] with a cone-shaped head, wearing an impossibly tall [[top hat]], a spider [[bolo tie]], and a ribbon of office that says \"Mayor\" on it. His cone-shaped head has two faces: One face is peach-skinned, rosy-cheeked, and smiling while the other face is white-skinned, pale and frowning with pointed teeth. Depending on the Mayor's mood, his head swivels around to display the right face with a loud clicking sound. When not in use, the other face has its eyes closed and is considered dormant. This split personality is likely inspired by a literal interpretation of the phrase \"two-faced politicians\".\n\nDespite his office, the Mayor apparently has very little actual authority in the day-to-day running of the town, or has very little confidence in his leadership skills, especially in planning for [[Halloween]]. This is attested when he arrives at [[Jack Skellington]]'s house to discuss some plans with him, not knowing that Jack is not home. When Jack does not answer, the Mayor quickly gets hysterical and yells, more to himself than anyone, \"Jack, please, I'm only an ''elected'' official here! I can't make decisions by myself!\". Nonetheless, the Mayor seems to enjoy his position. He apparently owns the only automobile in town, a [[hearse]]-like car called the \"Mayor-mobile\" that is equipped with a loudspeaker for making announcements and a black cat-shaped hood ornament that sounds a siren when its tail is cranked. The Mayor supports Jack and helps him in his quest to bring his own version of [[Christmas]] to the world, despite his secret misgivings about it. When Jack is apparently killed by the [[United States Army|US Army]], the Mayor openly admits he had a bad feeling about \"this Christmas thing\" and sorrowfully goes off in his Mayor-mobile to make the announcement throughout Halloween Town and the surrounding countryside that \"the king of Halloween has been blown to smithereens\". Later, he is told by Lock, Shock, and Barrel that Jack is in over his head and alive, and comes to retrieve him and Sally after Oogie Boogie has been defeated. The Mayor of Halloween Town is among the citizens surprised (and once again uneasy) when it starts snowing in Halloween Town, but when he catches a snowflake on his tongue, his head swivels around to reveal his pleased expression.\n\nThe Mayor of Halloween Town appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. His role in both games is fairly minor. In the first game, he helps Jack and Sora find an ingredient they need for the heart Dr. Finklestein is making. In the second game, he tries to stop two Heartless outbreaks by yelling at the Heartless through his megaphone, but has no success.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', the Mayor is seen in the opening cut scene congratulating Jack on another \"horrible\" Halloween. He is later seen in the level \"Mayor's Madhouse\" where Jack rescues him from a cage hanging from the roof of his house. While Jack goes to Christmas Town, the Mayor frees the other holiday leaders.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]] in the film, ''Oogie's Revenge'', and ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> and by [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''Kingdom Hearts''. His Japanese voice actor is [[T\u014dru \u014chira]].\n\n===Lock, Shock and Barrel===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Lock, Shock, and Barrel\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Paul Reubens]] (Lock)<br/> [[Catherine O'Hara]] (Shock)<br/> [[Danny Elfman]] (Barrel) \n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Lock, Shock, and Barrel''' are introduced as [[#Oogie Boogie|Oogie Boogie]]'s \"little henchmen\", being 6, 7 and 5 years old respectively. The trio are not very loyal to Oogie, as they are simply making mischief both for their own fun and to stay on his good side (in other words, they serve him out of fear) and after his death they just have harmless fun, which they seem to enjoy more. However, this is contrasted by their lack of common sense as, presumably due to their lust for mischief they have shown no protest when their master was revived in the spinoffs, and once out of boredom revived him themselves in \"[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge|Oogie's Revenge]]\". They all three are [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treaters]], with masks similar to their faces (e.g. Barrel's skeleton mask is large and round to fit his face, with a huge grin on it like his near-permanent creepy smile). Their names are a play on the phrase, \"[[wiktionary:lock, stock and barrel|lock, stock, and barrel]].\" Though not totally antagonistic, they are usually the comedy relief. They appear to be Anti-heroes or merely neutral characters, as they'll work for most of those who summon them.\n\n* '''Lock''' is the leader of Oogie's Boys, but does not always think through things thoroughly and just likes to be in charge. Lock wears a red [[devil]] costume; his tail is a real devil's tail, his [[teeth]] are pointed sharply. His face is narrow and long-jawed with angular features, and his red and brown [[hair]] is formed into two [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] making him, literally, a handsome devil. He likes to think highly of himself and gets upset when others insult him or take the lead; however, he goes along with others' ideas if he fails to come up with anything himself.\n* '''Shock''' is the only female of Oogie's henchmen. She is the oldest, and the most cunning and intelligent of the three. She has some [[contempt]] for the other two and their supposed stupidity, although she often gets tired with them. Shock wears a purple witch costume with an elongated hat and she sometimes carries a broomstick. She has a high-pitched girl's voice, green skin, a pointed nose, and purple wirey hair. She often takes the lead in many plans and likes to be right.\n* '''Barrel''' - is Oogie's \"star pupil,\" presumably the youngest, and considered the stupidest of the three troublemakers, despite his protests to the contrary. He is the butt of many jokes made by his friends, but usually gets even through his own tricks which he always gets away with. Barrel wears a skeleton costume and has deformed feet and almost always carries an orange and black lolipop, otherwise resembling a small human boy, albeit one with white [[human skin|skin]], sunken [[human eye|eye]]s, and perfectly coiffed green hair. His face is round and has a perpetual grin, except when he is angry or scared. Barrel usually pilots the walking bathtub the trio use as transport. He also unintentionally bothers [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] when asking him a number of annoying questions. Often he gets left out of things because he is forever falling over his own deformed feet and he is sometimes slow to catch on.\n\nInstructing them to \"leave that no-account [[Oogie Boogie]] OUT of this!\" (they promise to do so, but cross their fingers behind their backs), [[Jack Skellington|Jack]] sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel to \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\" (the Halloween Town residents' mistaken name for [[Santa Claus]]). At first, they accidentally capture the [[Easter Bunny]], whereupon Jack tells them to apologize and sends them back. They then capture their true quarry, and Jack takes Santa's hat. The trio then take Santa Claus to Oogie's lair, where Oogie taunts and threatens Santa. Once Jack has defeated Oogie and rescued Santa Claus, a hatch above opens and Lock, Shock, and Barrel appear now protagonists, having led the [[Mayor (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Mayor]] to Oogie's lair to find them.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King'', Oogie Boogie sends Lock, Shock, and Barrel out to nab the new \"Pumpkin King.\" They come back with Sally instead, saying she looked like Jack in the dark. Throughout the game, they are behind most of the ruckus going on around town ranging from poisoning the [[acid]] pools, driving the [[leech]]es crazy, knocking down the town's [[street light|street lamps]], luring Jack into [[death]] traps, and helping Oogie in the final battle.\n\nIn ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel decide to revive Oogie Boogie when they learn that Jack is temporarily leaving Halloween Town. In the game, Jack encounters the three one by one. In chapter 15, the threesome try to stop Jack a final time in their mobile bathtub on top of the Mayor of Halloween Town's house. He defeats them yet they spring a trap and drop him into a [[maze]] in Oogie's lair. They do not appear again in the game afterwards.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', after hearing Jack speak of a heart that can control the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Heartless]], Oogie sends the three out to steal the heart as part of his plan to take over Halloween Town. After the three are defeated by [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]], they confess that Oogie made them do it. Later in the game, they comment how quiet Halloween Town has become without Oogie and consider making a ruckus just to liven things up. In ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', the three found a Heartless and raised it before it became too big for them to control.\n\nIn ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', Lock, Shock, and Barrel start off working as [[Doctor Finklestein]]'s (Not very obedient) lab assistants, until they encounter [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]], who revives Oogie Boogie for them and gives them the \"Prison Keeper\" Heartless to hold off Sora and company. The monster keeps the children in a cage underneath its body, but swallows one of them to act as its \"pilot\", each giving the monster a different ability and appearance, ultimately swallowing all three of them attacking [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and party with its full repertoire. After its defeat, the trio run off saying it was 'fun' and unintentionally reveal Oogie's return. In the second visit, the three are accused of stealing presents after they enter Santa's workshop and are caught looking through gifts. Sora and the party have to fight these mischievous rascals by knocking them unconscious and putting them in boxes. In the end, the three claim that they did not steal the presents as they regard Christmas toys to be boring while revealing that they were actually looking for parts for Doctor Finklestein's Experiment. They also cause mischief as obstacles in the \"Making Presents\" mini game, before and after the fight with the Experiment. After the battle, they run off and are not seen again in the game.\n\nDespite having apparently reformed at the end of the film in later appearances, they have reverted to being antagonist. This suggests that they like working for Oogie Boogie more than being good.\n\nIn the movie, Lock was voiced by [[Paul Reubens]], Shock was voiced by [[Catherine O'Hara]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Danny Elfman]].<ref name=\"Jerry Beck 2005\"/> In the Kingdom Hearts series, Lock was voiced by [[Jess Harnell]], Shock was voiced by [[Kath Soucie]], and Barrel was voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. In ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge]]'', Paul Reubens reprised the role of Lock, Kath Soucie reprised the role of Shock from the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series, and [[Dee Bradley Baker]] voiced Barrel.\n\n===Santa Claus===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Santa Claus\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = [[Ed Ivory]] (''The Nightmare Before Christmas'')<br/>[[Corey Burton]] (video games)\n| species     = [[Human]]\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''[[Santa Claus]]''' (or '''Sandy Claws''' as Jack calls him) is the leader of Christmas Town. When Jack stumbles upon the town, he becomes mesmerized with the holiday and he tries to bring Christmas to Halloween Town. In order to do so, Jack orders Lock, Shock, and Barrel to kidnap Santa on [[Christmas Eve]] so Jack can take his place for the Christmas season. The three then take Santa to Oogie Boogie where the holiday figure's life is threatened. A last minute rescue helps save not only Santa, but the entire holiday of Christmas as well. Santa Claus manages to round up the living gifts and replace them with the right ones. Santa Claus is last seen flying over Halloween Town as snow starts to fall.\n\nIn ''The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge'', Oogie Boogie targets Santa Claus and leaves him hanging over the tracks for his scissor-tipped Oogie Train to drop him. Santa Claus was saved by Jack Skellington. When Oogie Boogie hijacked Santa's sleigh, Jack lets him use the same sleigh he used when Jack tried to improvise Christmas.\n\nSanta Claus appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy meet Santa Claus when they follow Jack Skellington to Christmas Town. He also made a reference about how Jack Skellington tried to improvise Christmas. Maleficent revives Oogie Boogie and sends him to capture Santa Claus. When Sora defeats Oogie Boogie, Santa Claus tells Jack that he should concentrate on Halloween and Santa should concentrate on Christmas. He also tells Sora to believe that he will meet Riku again. Later on, Santa's presents get stolen by Dr. Finklestein's Experiment. He helps Jack make decoy presents to attract the Experiment. Jack and company get them back by hiding in a decoy present. After they defeat the Experiment, Santa Claus decides to give Jack a taste of what it's like to deliver Christmas presents. When Jack finishes delivering presents, Santa takes back his sleigh and brings forth beautiful snow drops as a present to those in Halloween Town.\n\nSanta Claus is voiced by [[Ed Ivory]] in the movie and by [[Corey Burton]] in the video game spin-offs.\n\n===Zero===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5897F6\n| name        = Zero\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993)\n| creator     = [[Tim Burton]]\n| voice       = \n| species     = Ghost Dog\n| alias       = \n| noinfo      = yes\n}}\n'''Zero''' is Jack's faithful [[ghost]] [[dog]] who floats about freely and follows Jack wherever he goes. His nose, which is in the shape of a jack-o-lantern, also doubles as a bright light.\n\nIn the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, Zero is often called upon to search for someone.

They resemble the Skeletons in Oogie Boogie's lair.\n** '''Blue Skeletons''' - The Blue Skeletons are the easiest to defeat. They are slow and have short reaches unless they are mad and spinning.\n** '''Heat Skeletons''' - The Heat Skeletons are the most annoying of the enemies Jack fights. They have short reaches, but they can throw boomerangs.\n** '''[[Orc]] Skeletons''' - They are like the Blue Skeletons except the mad ones wield clubs.

They can only be grabbed when the Soul Robber is Level 3. If they drop their clubs, use the Soul Robber to throw the clubs at them.\n** '''King Skeletons''' - The King Skeletons are also big and wield big axes. The attack on the King Skeletons are the same as Troll Skeletons, with two exceptions. They cannot be grabbed at all, only turned around.

As a child, she won local children's drawing contests and in her teens attended a school, [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]], known for its arts instruction.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> Between 1924 and 1929 she studied at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] where she worked under [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the summer months she traveled to Europe and during one of these trips studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> She had one additional period of training in the late 1940s when she learned techniques of abstraction and expressionism from [[Jack Tworkov]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nWhen she was not traveling, Eisner lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and rented a studio on Cornelia Street.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/><ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> In 1930 she contributed a still life in a group show at the Opportunity Gallery that also included works by [[Edith Hamlin]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1930\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of collectors along with the artist Gifford Beal set up the nonprofit Opportunity Gallery in the fall of 1927.<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\"/> Each exhibition was selected by a well-known artist with the overall goal of showing new talent in a wide range of artistic styles.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Nov 1927\"/> [[Mark Rothko]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] all showed at the gallery during its early years.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Gallery\"/> }} Throughout the rest of the decade her paintings appeared frequently in shows held by nonprofit organizations, including Salons of America (1931, 1932, 1933), the [[Society of Independent Artists]] (1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937), the [[College Art Association]] (traveling exhibitions in 1932 and 1933), the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]] (annually, 1933 to 1939), the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1934), and the [[New York Society of Women Artists]] (1935, 1936, 1938).<ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/>{{refn|group=note|In 1922 [[Hamilton Easter Field]] founded Salons of America to give artists an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable. A reporter said he aimed \"to give equal opportunity to every member, whether he or she be a conservative or a post-Dadaist.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Jul 1922\"/>}} In these large shows Eisner's paintings were regularly singled out for praise by New York critics. Thus, for example, in 1936 the ''New York Post'' critic noted her \"thorough and vigorous\" canvases.<ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/> In 1937 Edward Alden Jewell of the ''Times'' called attention to her free brushwork.<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1937\"/> In 1938, a ''Post'' critic called one of her paintings \"the outstanding canvas of the show.\"<ref name=\"New York Post Feb 1938\"/>\n\nIn 1932 the Morton Gallery mounted her first solo exhibition. In it, she showed paintings depicting life in the mountains of the [[Carolinas]].<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Critics responded favorably to the show. A review in the ''New York Post'' said she had technical facility and showed her subjects freshly and spontaneously.<ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/> Writing in the ''New York Sun'', a critic wrote that the paintings were social documents that revealed life in the southern mountains in a way that was \"vastly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/> A critic for the ''New York Times'' noticed that Eisner showed more interest in the people she encountered than in the scenic environment in which they passed their lives and concluded that \"she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/>  Her depiction of a fiddler drew attention in both the ''Sun'' and the ''Times''. Late in life, a contemporary of Eisner's, [[Joseph Solman]], said of the [[Social realism|social realist]] style of the time: \"We were all seeking the flat, and the exaggerated, and the expressionist in our own romantic, different ways.\"<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\"/>\n\nTwo years later the Delphic Studio gave Eisner and Grace Bliss Stewart a duo exhibition. On this occasion the ''New York Sun'' featured a photo of another Carolina mountains painting, \"Franklin's View.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/>{{refn|group=note|Journalist and art patron [[Alma Reed]] founded Delphic Studios in 1929. Mainly known for its emphasis on Mexican art, the gallery also showed photographers, such as [[Edward Weston]] and [[Ansel Adams]] as well as Eisner and other contemporary American artists.<ref name=\"Delphic Studio\"/> }} The ''Sun'''s critic, who found her work to be on the whole \"attractive,\" used the label \"communist\" as shorthand for Eisner's social realist style in her mountain paintings. The critic said, \"[she] paints citizens who have a good deal of the soil upon their clothes.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Howard Devree of the ''New York Times'' said the paintings showed increased strength and sureness and praised her use of warm reds in a generally low palette.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/>\n\n[[File:1937DeweyCommission.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Dewey Commission, 1937, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\nIn the late 1930s Eisner exhibited as a member of a [[popular front]] organization called the [[American Artists' Congress]].<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1937\"/> After the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1940 she and a small group of like-minded artists quit the Congress to found an avowedly non-political organization called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"Federation of modern painters and sculptors 2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of New York artists formed the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in the spring of 1940. All had resigned from the American Artists' Congress to protest its \"Stalinist line\" after the congress had endorsed the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/> The federation aimed to be non-political. Its principal goal was to promote artistic independence and its members adhered to no specific style or school of painting. By means of exhibitions, publications, and lectures it set itself to promote the \"general interest of contemporary art.\" In addition to Eisner and her sister Anne, founding members included [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Anne Goldthwaite]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Balcomb Greene]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1942\"/> }} In 1937 Eisner and her husband traveled to Mexico to help the [[Dewey Commission]] investigate charges leveled against [[Leon Trotsky]] by the Soviet government in the [[Moscow Trials]] of 1936\u20131937. Eisner made a painting of commission members interviewing Trotsky in a house on the outskirts of Mexico City owned by Rivera and [[Frida Kahlo]]. The painting (shown at left) contains a view of [[Diego Rivera]] who is making a sketch of the scene.<ref name=\"Trotsky Commission Painting\"/> She also made two portraits of Trotsky. The two of them joked about a time when she scraped off pigment in painting his face. He made an affectionate, albeit macabre joke that she was beheading him.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> This painting is shown in the photo of Trotsky and Eisner at top right.\n\nAfter World War II Eisner traveled widely with her husband. His work as a journalist for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine and his passion for fishing helped to determine the locations they visited. In 1947 they spent time on [[Cape Breton Island]] and, beginning in 1949 they started to make periodic visits to [[Livingston, Montana]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Returning from Montana in the early 1950s, Eisner began a short period of study with [[Jack Tworkov]] in New York.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/>{{refn|group=note|Tworkov taught art throughout much of his career. In the early 1930s he taught briefly at the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]] in Manhattan. Between 1948 and 1958 he was a part-time instructor at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] and [[Pratt Institute]]. He was also at one time an instructor at [[Black Mountain College]] and in the 1960s taught at the [[Yale School of Art]], becoming chair of the art department in 1963.<ref name=\"Tworkov Papers AAA\"/> }} In 1960 she and her husband began spending summer months on [[Great Cranberry Island]].<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\"/>\n\nDuring these years and continuing into the 1970s she continued exhibiting with the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/><ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/> During this period she also continued to be given solo exhibitions in New York commercial galleries. In 1961 she was given a solo exhibition at the James Gallery and in 1966 and in 1969 at the Cisneros Gallery.<ref name=\"New York Times Feb 1961\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1966\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1969\"/>\n\nAfter her death in 1984 she was given a succession of retrospective exhibitions. These included the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] (1992, \"Dorothy Eisner: Paintings and Collages\"), Acme Fine Art (Boston, 2005, \"Late Expressionist Paintings,\" and 2009, \"Dorothy Eisner on Cranberry Island\"), [[Ogunquit Museum of American Art|Ogunquit Museum]] (2008, Cranberry Island paintings), and Gleason Fine Art (Boothbay Harbor Maine, 2017).<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/><ref name=\"Boothbay Register May 2017\"/> In 2009 her work also appeared in an exhibition called \"The Art of the Cranberry Isles\" in the [[Portland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News Mar 2009\"/>\n\n===Positions in art organizations===\n\nEisner immersed herself in the art world while still young. In 1930, aged twenty-four, she joined the board of the Society of Independent Artists. Not long afterward she became a member of the American Artists' Congress, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the New York Society of Women Artists. As noted above, she was a founding member of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1941.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> It seems likely that her marriage, the war, and the birth of a daughter (1942) dampened the impulse to participate in other organizations.\n\n===Artistic style===\n[[File:1931FiddlersConvention.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Fiddlers' Convention, about 1931, black and white photographic print of an oil painting, 9 x 7 inches]]\n[[File:1958YellowstoneRiver.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Yellowstone River, about 1958, oil on canvas, 44 x 36 inches]]\n\nIn reviewing shows of the paintings she made in the 1930s, critics noticed that when choosing subjects Eisner favored people over scenery.<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Two of them saw these paintings as lively and entertaining social documents having an authentic quality.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Others pointed out a muted palette and a tendency to drabness along with strong composition, ability to develop a subject freshly and spontaneously, and overall vigor and thoroughness.<ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/> For example, a critic for the ''New York Sun'' said Eisner painted her subjects \"roughly, but with a curious instinct for balance that makes the panels, as a whole, attractive.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Writing in the ''New York Times'' Howard Devree noted Eisner's skill in delineating subjects convincingly and praised her growing strength and sureness.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/> The painting, \"Fiddlers' Convention\" (shown at left) was mentioned as typical of her better 1930s work.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> In 1934 it was reproduced in an article in the ''Philadelphia Record'' reviewing the Pennsylvania Academy's 129th annual exhibition.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\nEisner's style changed little during the 1930s and war years. During the post-war period, while most of her work remained realist, she began to study under [[Jack Tworkov]]. Although much [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting was then anti-figurative, Tworkov, like his friend [[Willem de Kooning]], believed that even so-called pure abstraction made, as he said, \"analogy to the figure.\" His obituary in the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying \"Every painter has a subject whether or not there are objects in his paintings.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Sep 1982\"/> Eisner responded sympathetically to this approach. Later she was quoted as saying, \"Abstract Expressionism made me think differently. I learned from it a language of shapes and color that I was not conscious of when I was young.\"<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> During this period she produced much work in regular visits to the American [[mountain states]], particularly Livingston, Montana, and nearby [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Her painting \"Yellowstone River\" (seen at right) shows the influence of Tworkov's instruction. While it might be taken as a pure abstraction, the title shows it to be an abstract representation of a real place.\n\n[[File:1965PortraitInLight.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Portrait in Light, 1965, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\n[[File:1981InteriorStillLife.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Interior Still Life, 1981, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches]] \nIn 1960, when Eisner and her husband began spending summers on Great Cranberry Island, her work showed a new [[figurative art|figurative]] style. She often showed people relaxing and engaging in vacation-time pursuits: playing cards or croquet. Just as often her subjects would be inanimate: desks, chairs, windows, a towel rack. Writing in 2008 concerning a retrospective exhibition that showed these paintings, a critic said, \"her subject matter is so seemingly mundane that the viewer is startled by her choice.\"<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/> Although abstract, her style was firmly grounded in specific places at specific times, and its realist subjects were clearly evident. She made expressionistic use of bold colors, as she had in her 1950s abstractions, but in a style that critics saw as fluid, masterfully composed, and expressionistic.<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/> A critic said the paintings she made on Cranberry Island were orderly, distinct, and painted with great spirit.<ref name=\"Portland Press Herald Oct 2008\"/>\n\nAn early painting from this period, \"Portrait in Light\" (shown at left), has a greater degree of abstraction than a painting, \"Interior Still Life\" (shown at right) made only three years before her death. The latter work seems to show an influence of Matisse that critics saw in her work from the time she spent studying at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> From its inception in the 1930s through to its culmination in the late paintings, Eisner's output maintained a consistency that a gallerist summarized as derived from European modernism but also grounded in American painting of her own generation and the generation before her.<ref name=\"Gleason Fine Art\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nEisner was born in New York on January 17, 1906.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Her father was William J. Eisner. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880 and died in New York in 1975.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Orphaned while still young, he left school at 13 and later became one of the first makers of wax paper in the United States. Having moved to New York he was for many years president of a business called the Newark Paraffin and Parchment Paper Co.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/> Eisner's mother was Florine Eisner (1883-1974). Her father's name was Moritz Eisner. Born in Austria, he studied to be a chemist and after emigrating to the United States founded a business called Eisner-Mendelson Company that sold a malt extract and other health products.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1938\"/> After her marriage in 1905, Florine Eisner's maiden and married surnames were the same.\n\nEisner had a sister, [[Anne Eisner Putnam]] (1911-1967), who followed in her sister's footsteps. She studied at the Art Students League and served on its board of directors. She showed professionally during the 1940s with the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. After her marriage to Patrick Putnam she lived in the [[Ituri Rainforest]] within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Belgian Congo]] in a campsite adjacent to pygmies of the  [[Mbuti people]]. Patrick Putnam, who had an unpaid position as agent sanitaire, ran an informal dispensary and anthropological laboratory. For eight years Anne Eisner Putnam operated a small collection of guest houses from which she rented out rooms to visitors so as to support her husband's work.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Jun 1956\"/> Following Patrick's death in 1953 she returned to New York where she published a book, ''Madami: My Eight Years of Adventure with the Congo Pygmies'', describing her experiences and celebrating the Mbuti culture which she deeply respected.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Dec 1954\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s Florine Eisner (1883-1974) followed the example set by both daughters by studying at the Art Students League. Using Florine Rensie as her name, she joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and became a professional artist (Rensie is Eisner spelled backward).<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> After he retired from business in the early 1950s, William J. Eisner joined the rest of the family in studying art and becoming a professional artist.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nWilliam and Florine raised their family in Manhattan. During the warm months of the year they frequently traveled to their country home in Woodstock, New York and, after the children had grown they followed the example they had set and both became serious artists. William exhibited under his own name in galleries in nearby Kingston, New York, while Florine adopted Florine Rensie as her professional name to avoid the appearance of capitalizing on her daughters' artistic successes .<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nEarly in the 1930s Eisner worked in New York for the [[Resettlement Administration]]. In 1935 she met her future husband, [[John McDonald (journalist)|John Dennis McDonald]] (1906-1998), who was then working for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and in 1936 they married.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in literature and subsequently immersed himself in the socialist politics of the 1930s, particularly the [[anti-Stalinist left]]. In 1937 he joined the [[Dewey Commission]] as a technical assistant. He and Eisner traveled to Mexico with the commission staff. Chaired by the philosopher [[John Dewey]], the commission aimed to provide [[Leon Trotsky]] with a fair hearing of the charges made against him in the [[Moscow trials|Soviet show trials]] of 1936. While they opposed Stalinism, he and Eisner, like most members of the commission, were not themselves [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the latter part of the 1930s, McDonald worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in Washington, D.C. During World War II he worked in New York for a nonprofit motion picture production company called the American Film Center.{{refn|group=note|Founded by Donald Slesinger, a psychologist and law school dean, and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Film Center supported producers of educational and documentary films and produced films for the [[Office of Civilian Defense]]. Slesinger's inept management brought the center to bankruptcy in 1946.<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\"/>  }} In 1945 he began work as a staff writer at [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine.

Writers have been far in advance of artists in discovering the possibilities of subject-matter in this section. It is not the beauties of mountain landscape that have attracted Miss Eisner, but rather the individuality of people and the interest of their pastimes. A \"Fiddlers' Convention\" and a dance called \"Bird in Buzzard Out\" Miss Eisner evidently watched closely, for she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer. Individuals, too, she has portrayed in portrait studies. Although there is some authentic quality of the South in these paintings, they incline toward drabness of color, and the figures have not enough animation to make them live in paint. Most successfully realized are several still-lifes. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\">{{cite news |title=The Etchings of Georges Rouault |author=Edward Alden Jewell |work=New York Times |location=New York, New York |date=1933-05-07 |page=X8 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\">{{cite news |title=Henry V.

As a child, she won local children's drawing contests and in her teens attended a school, [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]], known for its arts instruction.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> Between 1924 and 1929 she studied at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] where she worked under [[Kenneth Hayes Miller]], [[Boardman Robinson]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the summer months she traveled to Europe and during one of these trips studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] in Paris.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/> She had one additional period of training in the late 1940s when she learned techniques of abstraction and expressionism from [[Jack Tworkov]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nWhen she was not traveling, Eisner lived in [[Greenwich Village]] and rented a studio on Cornelia Street.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/><ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> In 1930 she contributed a still life in a group show at the Opportunity Gallery that also included works by [[Edith Hamlin]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1930\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of collectors along with the artist Gifford Beal set up the nonprofit Opportunity Gallery in the fall of 1927.<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\"/> Each exhibition was selected by a well-known artist with the overall goal of showing new talent in a wide range of artistic styles.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle Nov 1927\"/> [[Mark Rothko]], [[Milton Avery]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] all showed at the gallery during its early years.<ref name=\"The Opportunity Gallery\"/> }} Throughout the rest of the decade her paintings appeared frequently in shows held by nonprofit organizations, including Salons of America (1931, 1932, 1933), the [[Society of Independent Artists]] (1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937), the [[College Art Association]] (traveling exhibitions in 1932 and 1933), the [[National Association of Women Artists|National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]] (annually, 1933 to 1939), the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] (1934), and the [[New York Society of Women Artists]] (1935, 1936, 1938).<ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Oct 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/>{{refn|group=note|In 1922 [[Hamilton Easter Field]] founded Salons of America to give artists an alternative to the Society of Independent Artists whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable.

Thus, for example, in 1936 the ''New York Post'' critic noted her \"thorough and vigorous\" canvases.<ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/> In 1937 Edward Alden Jewell of the ''Times'' called attention to her free brushwork.<ref name=\"New York Times Jan 1937\"/> In 1938, a ''Post'' critic called one of her paintings \"the outstanding canvas of the show.\"<ref name=\"New York Post Feb 1938\"/>\n\nIn 1932 the Morton Gallery mounted her first solo exhibition. In it, she showed paintings depicting life in the mountains of the [[Carolinas]].<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Critics responded favorably to the show. A review in the ''New York Post'' said she had technical facility and showed her subjects freshly and spontaneously.<ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/> Writing in the ''New York Sun'', a critic wrote that the paintings were social documents that revealed life in the southern mountains in a way that was \"vastly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/> A critic for the ''New York Times'' noticed that Eisner showed more interest in the people she encountered than in the scenic environment in which they passed their lives and concluded that \"she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/>  Her depiction of a fiddler drew attention in both the ''Sun'' and the ''Times''. Late in life, a contemporary of Eisner's, [[Joseph Solman]], said of the [[Social realism|social realist]] style of the time: \"We were all seeking the flat, and the exaggerated, and the expressionist in our own romantic, different ways.\"<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\"/>\n\nTwo years later the Delphic Studio gave Eisner and Grace Bliss Stewart a duo exhibition.

The critic said, \"[she] paints citizens who have a good deal of the soil upon their clothes.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Howard Devree of the ''New York Times'' said the paintings showed increased strength and sureness and praised her use of warm reds in a generally low palette.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/>\n\n[[File:1937DeweyCommission.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Dewey Commission, 1937, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\nIn the late 1930s Eisner exhibited as a member of a [[popular front]] organization called the [[American Artists' Congress]].<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1937\"/> After the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1940 she and a small group of like-minded artists quit the Congress to found an avowedly non-political organization called the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"Federation of modern painters and sculptors 2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|A group of New York artists formed the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in the spring of 1940. All had resigned from the American Artists' Congress to protest its \"Stalinist line\" after the congress had endorsed the [[Winter War|Soviet invasion of Finland]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/> The federation aimed to be non-political. Its principal goal was to promote artistic independence and its members adhered to no specific style or school of painting. By means of exhibitions, publications, and lectures it set itself to promote the \"general interest of contemporary art.\" In addition to Eisner and her sister Anne, founding members included [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Anne Goldthwaite]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Balcomb Greene]], and [[Mark Rothko]].<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1940\"/><ref name=\"New York Times May 1942\"/> }} In 1937 Eisner and her husband traveled to Mexico to help the [[Dewey Commission]] investigate charges leveled against [[Leon Trotsky]] by the Soviet government in the [[Moscow Trials]] of 1936\u20131937. Eisner made a painting of commission members interviewing Trotsky in a house on the outskirts of Mexico City owned by Rivera and [[Frida Kahlo]]. The painting (shown at left) contains a view of [[Diego Rivera]] who is making a sketch of the scene.<ref name=\"Trotsky Commission Painting\"/> She also made two portraits of Trotsky. The two of them joked about a time when she scraped off pigment in painting his face. He made an affectionate, albeit macabre joke that she was beheading him.<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> This painting is shown in the photo of Trotsky and Eisner at top right.\n\nAfter World War II Eisner traveled widely with her husband. His work as a journalist for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine and his passion for fishing helped to determine the locations they visited. In 1947 they spent time on [[Cape Breton Island]] and, beginning in 1949 they started to make periodic visits to [[Livingston, Montana]].<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Returning from Montana in the early 1950s, Eisner began a short period of study with [[Jack Tworkov]] in New York.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/>{{refn|group=note|Tworkov taught art throughout much of his career. In the early 1930s he taught briefly at the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture High School]] in Manhattan. Between 1948 and 1958 he was a part-time instructor at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] and [[Pratt Institute]]. He was also at one time an instructor at [[Black Mountain College]] and in the 1960s taught at the [[Yale School of Art]], becoming chair of the art department in 1963.<ref name=\"Tworkov Papers AAA\"/> }} In 1960 she and her husband began spending summer months on [[Great Cranberry Island]].<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\"/>\n\nDuring these years and continuing into the 1970s she continued exhibiting with the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/><ref name=\"AskArt Dorothy Eisner\"/> During this period she also continued to be given solo exhibitions in New York commercial galleries. In 1961 she was given a solo exhibition at the James Gallery and in 1966 and in 1969 at the Cisneros Gallery.<ref name=\"New York Times Feb 1961\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1966\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1969\"/>\n\nAfter her death in 1984 she was given a succession of retrospective exhibitions. These included the [[Farnsworth Art Museum]] (1992, \"Dorothy Eisner: Paintings and Collages\"), Acme Fine Art (Boston, 2005, \"Late Expressionist Paintings,\" and 2009, \"Dorothy Eisner on Cranberry Island\"), [[Ogunquit Museum of American Art|Ogunquit Museum]] (2008, Cranberry Island paintings), and Gleason Fine Art (Boothbay Harbor Maine, 2017).<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art Mar 2005\"/><ref name=\"Boothbay Register May 2017\"/> In 2009 her work also appeared in an exhibition called \"The Art of the Cranberry Isles\" in the [[Portland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"Bangor Daily News Mar 2009\"/>\n\n===Positions in art organizations===\n\nEisner immersed herself in the art world while still young. In 1930, aged twenty-four, she joined the board of the Society of Independent Artists. Not long afterward she became a member of the American Artists' Congress, the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the New York Society of Women Artists. As noted above, she was a founding member of the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors in 1941.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> It seems likely that her marriage, the war, and the birth of a daughter (1942) dampened the impulse to participate in other organizations.\n\n===Artistic style===\n[[File:1931FiddlersConvention.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Fiddlers' Convention, about 1931, black and white photographic print of an oil painting, 9 x 7 inches]]\n[[File:1958YellowstoneRiver.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Yellowstone River, about 1958, oil on canvas, 44 x 36 inches]]\n\nIn reviewing shows of the paintings she made in the 1930s, critics noticed that when choosing subjects Eisner favored people over scenery.<ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Two of them saw these paintings as lively and entertaining social documents having an authentic quality.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> Others pointed out a muted palette and a tendency to drabness along with strong composition, ability to develop a subject freshly and spontaneously, and overall vigor and thoroughness.<ref name=\"New York Times Dec 1933\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Jan 1936\"/><ref name=\"New York Post Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 1932\"/> For example, a critic for the ''New York Sun'' said Eisner painted her subjects \"roughly, but with a curious instinct for balance that makes the panels, as a whole, attractive.\"<ref name=\"New York Sun Mar 1934\"/> Writing in the ''New York Times'' Howard Devree noted Eisner's skill in delineating subjects convincingly and praised her growing strength and sureness.<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\"/> The painting, \"Fiddlers' Convention\" (shown at left) was mentioned as typical of her better 1930s work.<ref name=\"New York Sun Nov 1932\"/><ref name=\"New York Times Nov 21 1932\"/> In 1934 it was reproduced in an article in the ''Philadelphia Record'' reviewing the Pennsylvania Academy's 129th annual exhibition.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/>\n\nEisner's style changed little during the 1930s and war years. During the post-war period, while most of her work remained realist, she began to study under [[Jack Tworkov]]. Although much [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painting was then anti-figurative, Tworkov, like his friend [[Willem de Kooning]], believed that even so-called pure abstraction made, as he said, \"analogy to the figure.\" His obituary in the ''New York Times'' quoted him as saying \"Every painter has a subject whether or not there are objects in his paintings.\"<ref name=\"New York Times Sep 1982\"/> Eisner responded sympathetically to this approach. Later she was quoted as saying, \"Abstract Expressionism made me think differently. I learned from it a language of shapes and color that I was not conscious of when I was young.\"<ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> During this period she produced much work in regular visits to the American [[mountain states]], particularly Livingston, Montana, and nearby [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Her painting \"Yellowstone River\" (seen at right) shows the influence of Tworkov's instruction. While it might be taken as a pure abstraction, the title shows it to be an abstract representation of a real place.\n\n[[File:1965PortraitInLight.jpg|left|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Portrait in Light, 1965, oil on canvas, 25 x 30 inches]]\n[[File:1981InteriorStillLife.jpg|right|thumb|Dorothy Eisner, Interior Still Life, 1981, oil on canvas, 24 x 30 inches]] \nIn 1960, when Eisner and her husband began spending summers on Great Cranberry Island, her work showed a new [[figurative art|figurative]] style. She often showed people relaxing and engaging in vacation-time pursuits: playing cards or croquet. Just as often her subjects would be inanimate: desks, chairs, windows, a towel rack. Writing in 2008 concerning a retrospective exhibition that showed these paintings a critic said, \"her subject matter is so seemingly mundane that the viewer is startled by her choice.\"<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/> Although abstract, her style was firmly grounded in specific places at specific times, and its realist subjects were clearly evident. She made expressionistic use of bold colors, as she had in her 1950s abstractions, but in a style that critics saw as fluid, masterfully composed, and expressionistic.<ref name=\"Ogunquit Museum 2008\"/><ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/> A critic said the paintings she made on Cranberry Island were orderly, distinct, and painted with great spirit.<ref name=\"Portland Press Herald Oct 2008\"/>\n\nAn early painting from this period, \"Portrait in Light\" (shown at left), has a greater degree of abstraction than a painting, \"Interior Still Life\" (shown at right) made only three years before her death. The latter work seems to show an influence of Matisse that critics saw in her work from the time she spent studying at Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"New England Today Jan 2009\"/><ref name=\"ACME Fine Art 2016\"/> From its inception in the 1930s through to its culmination in the late paintings, Eisner's output maintained a consistency that a gallerist summarized as derived from European modernism but also grounded in American painting of her own generation and the generation before her.<ref name=\"Gleason Fine Art\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nEisner was born in New York on January 17, 1906.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Her father was William J. Eisner. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1880 and died in New York in 1975.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Orphaned while still young, he left school at 13 and later became one of the first makers of wax paper in the United States. Having moved to New York he was for many years president of a business called the Newark Paraffin and Parchment Paper Co.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/> Eisner's mother was Florine Eisner (1883-1974). Her father's name was Moritz Eisner. Born in Austria, he studied to be a chemist and after emigrating to the United States founded a business called Eisner-Mendelson Company that sold a malt extract and other health products.<ref name=\"New York Times Jun 1938\"/> After her marriage in 1905, Florine Eisner's maiden and married surnames were the same.\n\nEisner had a sister, [[Anne Eisner Putnam]] (1911-1967), who followed in her sister's footsteps. She studied at the Art Students League and served on its board of directors. She showed professionally during the 1940s with the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. After her marriage to Patrick Putnam she lived in the [[Ituri Rainforest]] within the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Belgian Congo]] in a campsite adjacent to pygmies of the  [[Mbuti people]]. Patrick Putnam, who had an unpaid position as agent sanitaire, ran an informal dispensary and anthropological laboratory. For eight years Anne Eisner Putnam operated a small collection of guest houses from which she rented out rooms to visitors so as to support her husband's work.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Jun 1956\"/> Following Patrick's death in 1953 she returned to New York where she published a book, ''Madami: My Eight Years of Adventure with the Congo Pygmies'', describing her experiences and celebrating the Mbuti culture which she deeply respected.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Dec 1954\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s Florine Eisner (1883-1974) followed the example set by both daughters by studying at the Art Students League. Using Florine Rensie as her name, she joined the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and became a professional artist (Rensie is Eisner spelled backward).<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> After he retired from business in the early 1950s, William J. Eisner joined the rest of the family in studying art and becoming a professional artist.<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nWilliam and Florine raised their family in Manhattan. During the warm months of the year they frequently traveled to their country home in Woodstock, New York and, after the children had grown they followed the example they had set and both became serious artists. William exhibited under his own name in galleries in nearby Kingston, New York, while Florine adopted Florine Rensie as her professional name to avoid the appearance of capitalizing on her daughters' artistic successes .<ref name=\"Kingston Daily Freeman Aug 1961\"/>\n\nEarly in the 1930s Eisner worked in New York for the [[Resettlement Administration]]. In 1935 she met her future husband, [[John McDonald (journalist)|John Dennis McDonald]] (1906-1998), who was then working for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] and in 1936 they married.<ref name=\"Dorothy Eisner papers\"/> Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a master's degree in literature and subsequently immersed himself in the socialist politics of the 1930s, particularly the [[anti-Stalinist left]]. In 1937 he joined the [[Dewey Commission]] as a technical assistant. He and Eisner traveled to Mexico with the commission staff. Chaired by the philosopher [[John Dewey]], the commission aimed to provide [[Leon Trotsky]] with a fair hearing of the charges made against him in the [[Moscow trials|Soviet show trials]] of 1936. While they opposed Stalinism, he and Eisner, like most members of the commission, were not themselves [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]].<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\"/> During the latter part of the 1930s, McDonald worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project]] in Washington, D.C. During World War II he worked in New York for a nonprofit motion picture production company called the American Film Center.{{refn|group=note|Founded by Donald Slesinger, a psychologist and law school dean, and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the American Film Center supported producers of educational and documentary films and produced films for the [[Office of Civilian Defense]]. Slesinger's inept management brought the center to bankruptcy in 1946.<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\"/>  }} In 1945 he began work as a staff writer at [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] magazine. In 1949 he joined its editorial board and remained in that position until he retired in 1971. His writings showed a wide breadth of his interest, including economic theory and game theory as well as fishing and horse racing.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> The author of scholarly texts as well as journal articles, he was best known for a book that listed him as editor although he was in fact its author: ''My Years with General Motors, by Alfred P. Sloan Jr.'' (1964).<ref name=\"Boston Globe Nov 2002\"/>\n\nMcDonald had a daughter, Joan (born 1929), by a prior, relatively brief, marriage with Lorraine Oven.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/> Eisner and McDonald had one child, a daughter, Christie Anne (born 1942), who, at time of this writing, is the Smith Professor of French Language and Literature and Chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/><ref name=\"Christie McDonald Harvard\"/>\n\nEisner died in New York on April 28, 1984.<ref name=\"John McDonald SNAC\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth=30em\n|refs=\n\n<!-- journals -->\n\n<ref name=\"Harvard Review 2006\">{{cite journal |author=Christie McDonald |date=2006 |volume= |issue=30 |pages=142\u2013149 | title=Brushes with History |jstor=27569177 |journal=Harvard Review |location= |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |quote= }}</ref>\n\n<!-- books -->\n\n<ref name=\"Learning With Lights Off 2012\">{{cite book |author1=Devin Orgeron |author2=Marsha Orgeron |author3=Dan Streible |title=Learning with the Lights Off: Educational Film in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXxMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA244 |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-045251-3 |pages=243\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Art of Acadia 2016\">{{cite book |author1=David Little |author2=Carl Little |title=Art of Acadia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA181 |date=1 August 2016 |publisher=Down East Books |isbn=978-1-60893-475-1 |page=181}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dRU2c1LPcYC |title=Georgia O'Keeffe: A Life |publisher=Upne |year=1989 |format= |page=302 |author=Roxana Robinson |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Adoph Gottlieb 1995\">{{cite book |author1=Lawrence Alloway |author2=Mary D.

It is not the beauties of mountain landscape that have attracted Miss Eisner, but rather the individuality of people and the interest of their pastimes. A \"Fiddlers' Convention\" and a dance called \"Bird in Buzzard Out\" Miss Eisner evidently watched closely, for she caught something of the characteristic bearing of the Southern mountaineer. Individuals, too, she has portrayed in portrait studies. Although there is some authentic quality of the South in these paintings, they incline toward drabness of color, and the figures have not enough animation to make them live in paint.

Such things are unimportant anyway when you like the picture. }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"New York Times Apr 1934\">{{cite news |title=Seen in the Galleries: Comment on Some of the Exhibitions That Have Opened Recently in This City |author=Howard Devree |work=New York Times |location=New York, New York |date=1934-04-01 |page=X9 |quote=Two One-Woman Shows  Oils by Grace Bliss Stewart and Dorothy Eisner are on exhibition at the Delphic Studios...

After getting trained in the major Sufi orders including [[Naqshbandi]] for 15 years, he received complete Khilafat (spiritual [[Ijazah]]) from his Shaykh.<ref name=Ghaffari/>\n\nHe had many Khulafa (deputies) who spread the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi order to a vast number of people in the whole Muslim world at that time. His Khulafa went to [[Bukhara]], [[Baghdad]], [[Madinah]] and [[Turkey]]. His famous khalifa was Mawlana [[Khalid al-Baghdadi]] who had hundreds of thousands of followers in his lifetime, and many [[Naqshbandi]]'s today in Turkey and nearby countries follow him. His chief deputy and successor was [Hafiz Abu-Saeed-Ahmadi Faruqi Mujaddidi Naqshbandi]]([[Delhi]])and his next successor was Hafiz Shah Ahmed Saeed Faruqi Mujaddidi, son of Hafiz Shah Abu Saeed ([[Medina]]) <ref name=Ghaffari/>\n\nHe is quoted to have said: \"My Faid (spirituality) has reached far off countries. Our Halqa is held in [[Makkah]] and our Halqa is held in [[Madinah]]. Similarly our Halqa is held in [[Baghdad]], Rome (now Turkey and Cyprus) and Maghrib (Parts of Europe and Africa facing Asia).
