Walton College of Business''' (often known as '''Walton College''' or abbreviated '''WCOB''' on campus) is the business college at the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. Created in 1926, the college is the second-largest college at the University, with over 5,000 undergraduate students as of Fall 2016. Walton College is known nationally for a strong emphasis on retail, finance, information systems, and supply chain management. The college has a close relationship with [[Walmart|Walmart Stores, Inc.]], based in nearby [[Bentonville, Arkansas]], and related vendor community.\n\nThe Sam Walton College of Business is among the top 25 undergraduate business schools and ranked in the top fifty graduate business schools in the nation in results published by [[US News and World Report]]. The [[Masters of Business Administration]] program is often ranked in the top 50 graduate business schools in the US.<ref>[http://waltoncollege.uark.edu/news/view.asp?article=455 Walton College reporting U.S. News and Report college survey results.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of the University of Arkansas}}\nThe School of Business Administration was established within the University of Arkansas in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://walton.uark.edu/about/history.php|title=University of Arkansas Walton College History|accessdate=2015-12-31 }}</ref>\n\n===Eponym===\n[[File:SamWalton-1936.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Sam Walton in 1936]]\nThe college is named after the founder of [[Walmart Stores, Inc.]], [[Sam Walton]], when in October 1998, the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation made a $50 million upfront cash gift.<ref name=\"name\" /> The company is headquartered in nearby [[Bentonville, Arkansas]], and employs hundreds of Walton College graduates.
