He was a [[Her Majesty's Government|government minister]] in the 1970s and a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] in the 1980s. Knighted in 2004, he became [[Father of the House]] in 2015 and was the oldest sitting MP of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] at the time of his death.\n\nHe was known for his forthright views, but very rarely voted against the Labour Party [[Whip (politics)#United Kingdom|whip]], thus his two rebellions carried greater weight. Kaufman was a [[criticism of Israel|critic of the state of Israel]] and came under criticism himself during the 2009 [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|parliamentary expenses scandal]].\n\n==Early life==\nKaufman was born in [[Leeds]], the youngest of seven children of Louis and Jane Kaufman.

The practice of banning books is a form of [[censorship]], from political, legal, religious, moral, or (less often) commercial motives. This article lists notable banned books and works, giving a brief context for the reason that each book was prohibited. Banned books include [[fiction]]al works such as [[novel]]s, [[poem]]s and plays and [[non-fiction]] works such as [[biographies]] and [[dictionaries]].\n\nSince there are a large number of banned books, some publishers have sought out to publish these books. The best-known examples are the Parisian [[Obelisk Press]], which published [[Henry Miller]]'s sexually [[Honesty|frank]] novel ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', and [[Olympia Press]], which published [[William Burroughs]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.  Both of these, the work of father [[Jack Kahane]] and son [[Maurice Girodias]], specialized in English-language books which were prohibited, at the time, in [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ruedo ib\u00e9rico|es}}, also located in Paris, specialized in books prohibited in [[Spain]] during the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]]. [[Russian literature]] prohibited during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period was published outside of [[Russia]].\n\nIn many territories, distribution, promotion, or certain translations of the [[Bible]] have historically been prohibited or impeded.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/world-watch-list/|title=World Watch List - Countries Where Christianity is Illegal & Oppressed|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Country|countries]] throughout the world have their own methods of restricting access to books, although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another: [[hate speech]], for example, is prohibited in a number of countries, such as [[Censorship in Sweden|Sweden]], though the same books may be legal in the United States or United Kingdom, where the only prohibition is on [[child pornography]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Statement doesn't match with the current list|date=January 2018}}\n\nDespite the opposition from the [[American Library Association]] (ALA), books continue to be banned by [[school library|school]] and [[public library|public libraries]] across the United States. This is usually the result of complaints from parents, who find particular books not [[appropriate]] for their children (e.g., books about [[sexual orientation]] such as ''[[And Tango Makes Three]]''). In many libraries, including the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]], [[Erotic literature|erotic books]] are housed in separate collections in restricted access reading rooms. In some libraries, a special application may be needed to read certain books.<ref>Peter Fryer, ''Private Case, Public Scandal'', London, Secker & Warburg, 1966.</ref> Libraries sometimes avoid purchasing [[controversy|controversial]] books, and the personal opinions of librarians have at times impacted book selection.\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Albania==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The practice of banning books is a form of [[censorship]], from political, legal, religious, moral, or (less often) commercial motives. This article lists notable banned books and works, giving a brief context for the reason that each book was prohibited. Banned books include [[fiction]]al works such as [[novel]]s, [[poem]]s and plays and [[non-fiction]] works such as [[biographies]] and [[dictionaries]].\n\nSince there are a large number of banned books, some publishers have sought out to publish these books. The best-known examples are the Parisian [[Obelisk Press]], which published [[Henry Miller]]'s sexually [[Honesty|frank]] novel ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', and [[Olympia Press]], which published [[William Burroughs]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.  Both of these, the work of father [[Jack Kahane]] and son [[Maurice Girodias]], specialized in English-language books which were prohibited, at the time, in [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]]. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ruedo ib\u00e9rico|es}}, also located in Paris, specialized in books prohibited in [[Spain]] during the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]]. [[Russian literature]] prohibited during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period was published outside of [[Russia]].\n\nIn many territories, distribution, promotion, or certain translations of the [[Bible]] have historically been prohibited or impeded.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=https://www.opendoorsusa.org/christian-persecution/world-watch-list/|title=World Watch List - Countries Where Christianity is Illegal & Oppressed|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Country|countries]] throughout the world have their own methods of restricting access to books, although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another: [[hate speech]], for example, is prohibited in a number of countries, such as [[Censorship in Sweden|Sweden]], though the same books may be legal in the United States or United Kingdom, where the only prohibition is on [[child pornography]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Statement doesn't match with the current list|date=January 2018}}\n\nDespite the opposition from the [[American Library Association]] (ALA), books continue to be banned by [[school library|school]] and [[public library|public libraries]] across the United States. This is usually the result of complaints from parents, who find particular books not appropriate for their children (e.g., books about sexual orientation such as ''[[And Tango Makes Three]]''). In many libraries, including the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]], [[Erotic literature|erotic books]] are housed in separate collections in restricted access reading rooms. In some libraries, a special application may be needed to read certain books.<ref>Peter Fryer, ''Private Case, Public Scandal'', London, Secker & Warburg, 1966.</ref> Libraries sometimes avoid purchasing [[controversy|controversial]] books, and the personal opinions of librarians have at times impacted book selection.\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Albania==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
