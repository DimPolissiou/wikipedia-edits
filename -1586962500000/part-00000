Since both candidates needed those electoral votes to win the election, Congress appointed a special Electoral Commission to settle the dispute over which slates of electors to accept. After the commission awarded all the disputed electoral votes to the Republican candidate, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], and Congress voted to accept their report, some dissatisfied Democrats claimed that Hayes or his supporters had made a secret compromise to secure the support of some Congressional Democrats. Most of the items in the alleged \"[[Compromise of 1877]]\" were either never acted on, which calls into question whether they were ever agreed to, or had already been the established position of Hayes from the time of his accepting the Republican nomination and so were not a sudden \"compromise\".\n\nHayes's detractors labeled the alleged compromise a \"Corrupt Bargain\"<ref>{{cite book |author= J.

That would remove an important tool the federal government had used to force the South to uphold the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendments, which were intended to protect the rights of [[African-Americans]], particularly their right to vote.  \n\nGenerally, political support for maintaining the troops had dissipated during Grant's second term, and Hayes had little choice but to accept some form of \"home rule.\" He attempted to do so, as stated in his nomination acceptance letter, by gaining promises from Southern states that they would respect the rights, and especially the voting rights, of the freedmen. On the other political side, the Democratic platform of [[Samuel Tilden]], also promised removal of troops, but with no mention of any attempts to guarantee the freedmen's rights. For a time, Hayes's approach had some success, but gradually Southern states moved to build new barriers to their right to vote.\n\n==1974 pardon of Nixon==\n{{main article|Pardon of Richard Nixon}}\n[[Gerald Ford]]'s 1974 [[pardon of Richard Nixon]] was described as a \"corrupt bargain\" by critics of the disgraced former president.{{Citation needed|reason=Other instances of description of an event as a corrupt bargain in the article are cited.

Since both candidates needed those electoral votes to win the election, Congress appointed a special Electoral Commission to settle the dispute over which slates of electors to accept. After the commission awarded all the disputed electoral votes to the Republican candidate, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], and Congress voted to accept their report, some dissatisfied Democrats claimed that Hayes or his supporters had made a secret compromise to secure the support of some Congressional Democrats. Most of the items in the alleged \"[[Compromise of 1877]]\" were either never acted on, which calls into question whether they were ever agreed to, or had already been the established position of Hayes from the time of his accepting the Republican nomination and so were not a sudden \"compromise\".\n\nHayes's detractors labeled the alleged compromise a \"Corrupt Bargain\"<ref>{{cite book |author= J.

That would remove an important tool the federal government had used to force the South to uphold the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendments, which were intended to protect the rights of [[African-Americans]], particularly their right to vote.  \n\nGenerally, political support for maintaining the troops had dissipated during Grant's second term, and Hayes had little choice but to accept some form of \"home rule.\" He attempted to do so, as stated in his nomination acceptance letter, by gaining promises from Southern states that they would respect the rights, and especially the voting rights, of the freedmen. On the other political side, the Democratic platform of [[Samuel Tilden]], also promised removal of troops, but with no mention of any attempts to guarantee the freedmen's rights.

Born in [[Sunderland]], England, Wight lived in Glasgow during his childhood and teenage years. After graduating from [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] in 1939, Wight moved back to England and was a veterinarian in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] for almost fifty years. He used this experience to write a series of eight books set in 1930s\u20131950s England about animals and their owners. He is best known for these semi-autobiographical works, which began with ''If Only They Could Talk'', published in 1970.\n\nThere have been multiple television and film adaptions of Wight's books, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and the [[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|BBC television series of the same name]], which ran for a total of 90 episodes.\n\n==Personal life==\nJames Alfred Wight was born on 3 October 1916 in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]], England to James (1890\u20131960) and Hannah Bell (1890\u20131980) Wight.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215236/http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2012 |title=James Herriot Biography |website=Biography.com |accessdate=5 December 2015 }}</ref> Shortly after their wedding, the Wights moved from Brandling Street, Sunderland, to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where James took work as a ship plater and as a pianist for a local cinema, while Hannah was a singer and a dressmaker.<ref name=\"memoir\">Wight, Jim. 2000.

He later wrote that \"I was intrigued by the character and behaviour of these animals... [I wanted to] spend my life working with them if possible.\"  At age twelve, he read an article in ''[[Meccano Magazine]]'' about veterinarians, and was captivated with the idea of treating sick animals as a career. Two years later, in 1930, the principal of [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] gave a lecture at Wight's high school, and Wight decided to become a veterinarian.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herriot |first1=James |title=James Herriot's Dog Stories |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-92558-1 |pages=xi\u2013xii}}</ref> He studied for six years at Glasgow Veterinary College, and qualified as a veterinary surgeon in December 1939 at age 23.<ref name=\"tti\"/>\n\nWight's first position, which he accepted in January 1940, was at a veterinary practice in Sunderland. He moved to work in a rural practice the following July, based at 23 Kirkgate in [[Thirsk]], Yorkshire, near the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[North York Moors]]. Owner [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]] offered him a salaried partnership in the practice, an excellent position at that time for a young veterinarian with little experience.

He did well in his training, and was one of the first men in his regiment to fly solo. After undergoing surgery on an [[anal fistula]] in July 1943, he was deemed unfit to fly combat aircraft and was discharged as a [[leading aircraftman]]. He joined his wife at her parents' house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to another location. In 1953, they moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk, opposite the secondary school.

''If Only They Could Talk'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by Michael Joseph Ltd, but sales were slow until [[Thomas McCormack (writer)|Thomas McCormack]] of [[St. Martin's Press]] in New York City received a copy and arranged to have the first two books published as a single volume in the United States. Wight named the volume ''All Creatures Great and Small'' from the second line of the hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\", inspired by a punning suggestion from his daughter that the book be called ''Ill Creatures Great and Small''.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> The resulting book was a huge success, spawning numerous sequels and movies and a television adaptation. \n\nWight's books are partially autobiographical, with many of the stories loosely based on real events or people. The stories are set in the fictional town of [[Darrowby]], which is a composite of Thirsk and its nearby market towns [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[Leyburn]], and [[Middleham]].<ref>''James Herriot's Yorkshire'' (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's</ref> Wight renamed Donald Sinclair and his brother [[Brian Sinclair (veterinary surgeon)|Brian]] as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name \"Helen Alderson\" for his wife Joan Danbury.  Wight's son James stated in his memoir that many of the stories which are set in the 1930s\u20131950s in the books were inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> \n\nThe books also document a transitional period in Britain's veterinary profession. Agriculture was moving from the use of draught animals (primarily horses) to the use of mechanical tractors, and medical science was on the verge of discovering antibiotics and other drugs that eliminated many of the ancient remedies still in use. These and other sociological factors (such as increased affluence) prompted a large-scale shift in veterinary practice over the course of the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, virtually all of a veterinarian's time was spent working with large animals such as horses, cattle and other livestock. By 2000, the majority of vets practised mostly on dogs, cats, and other pets belonging to a population having a larger disposable income. Wight (as Herriot) occasionally steps out of his narrative to comment on the primitive state of veterinary medicine at the time of the story he is relating.<ref name=\"thelordgodmadethemall:caesarian\">{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=The Lord God Made Them All|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=62\u201376}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''If Only They Could Talk'', Wight wrote seven more books. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently and were collected into omnibus volumes: the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, ''Every Living Thing'', immediately went into the top 10 best-seller list in Britain and had an 865,000 copy first edition printing in the United States.<ref name=\"But it did happen to a vet\">Margolis, Jonathan (12 December 2002 ''Time Magazine''{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}<!--no such issue date, no such title in the magazine's online article index--></ref> \n\n[[File:AllCreaturesGreatAndSmallSet-1-GCR 7908.JPG|thumb|Part of the [[BBC]] TV set for ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' on permanent display at the [[World of James Herriot]] museum in Thirsk, North Yorkshire]]\n\n==Film and television adaptions==\nWight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' followed by ''[[It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet]]'' in 1976, and the long-running [[BBC]] television series ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]''.

Born in [[Sunderland]], England, Wight lived in Glasgow during his childhood and teenage years. After graduating from [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] in 1939, Wight moved back to England and was a veterinarian in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] for almost fifty years. He used this experience to write a series of eight books set in 1930s\u20131950s England about animals and their owners. He is best known for these semi-autobiographical works, which began with ''If Only They Could Talk'', published in 1970.\n\nThere have been multiple television and film adaptions of Wight's books, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' and the [[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|BBC television series of the same name]], which ran for a total of 90 episodes.\n\n==Personal life==\nJames Alfred Wight was born on 3 October 1916 in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]], England to James (1890\u20131960) and Hannah Bell (1890\u20131980) Wight.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215236/http://www.biography.com/people/james-herriot-9336867 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 February 2012 |title=James Herriot Biography |website=Biography.com |accessdate=5 December 2015 }}</ref> Shortly after their wedding, the Wights moved from Brandling Street, Sunderland, to [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where James took work as a ship plater and as a pianist for a local cinema, while Hannah was a singer and a dressmaker.<ref name=\"memoir\">Wight, Jim. 2000.

He later wrote that \"I was intrigued by the character and behaviour of these animals... [I wanted to] spend my life working with them if possible.\"  At age twelve, he read an article in ''[[Meccano Magazine]]'' about veterinarians, and was captivated with the idea of treating sick animals as a career. Two years later, in 1930, the principal of [[Glasgow Veterinary College]] gave a lecture at Wight's high school, and Wight decided to become a veterinarian.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herriot |first1=James |title=James Herriot's Dog Stories |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-92558-1 |pages=xi\u2013xii |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> He spent six years of study at Glasgow Veterinary College, and qualified as a veterinary surgeon in December 1939 at age 23.<ref name=\"tti\"/>\n\nWight's first position, which he accepted in January 1940, was at a veterinary practice in Sunderland. He moved to work in a rural practice the following July, based at 23 Kirkgate in [[Thirsk]], Yorkshire, near the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[North York Moors]]. Owner [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]] offered him a salaried partnership in the practice, an excellent position at that time for a young veterinarian with little experience.

He did well in his training, and was one of the first men in his regiment to fly solo. After undergoing surgery on an [[anal fistula]] in July 1943, he was deemed unfit to fly combat aircraft and was discharged as a [[leading aircraftman]]. He joined his wife at her parents' house, where she had lived since he left Thirsk. They lived there until the summer of 1945, when they moved back to 23 Kirkgate after Sinclair and his wife moved to another location. In 1953, they moved to a house on Topcliffe Road, Thirsk, opposite the secondary school. The family later moved to the village of [[Thirlby]], about four miles from Thirsk, where Wight resided until his death.<ref name = \"memoir\"/>\n\nWight enjoyed athletics; he boxed and played football in college, and played cricket and tennis throughout his life.<ref name=\"jamesobit\">{{cite web |title=James Alfred Wight OBE ( James Herriot ) |url=https://www.thirsk.org.uk/james-herriot |website=Thirsk & Sowerby North Yorkshire |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref> He was also a strong supporter of [[Sunderland A.F.C.]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Farndale |first1=Nigel |title=James Herriot: the wild years |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8913071/James-Herriot-the-wild-years.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWight received an honorary doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1979.<ref name=\"heriot-watt\">{{cite web |title=Heriot-Watt University Honorary Graduates |url=https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/services/docs/secretariat/honorary-graduates-1966-present.pdf |website=Heriot-Watt University |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kingsx3.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]] Class 180 DMU named after James Herriot]]\n\nWight was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1991<ref name=\"memoir\" /> and was treated in the Lambert Memorial Hospital in Thirsk.

''If Only They Could Talk'' was published in the United Kingdom in 1970 by Michael Joseph Ltd, but sales were slow until [[Thomas McCormack (writer)|Thomas McCormack]] of [[St. Martin's Press]] in New York City received a copy and arranged to have the first two books published as a single volume in the United States. Wight named the volume ''All Creatures Great and Small'' from the second line of the hymn \"[[All Things Bright and Beautiful]]\", inspired by a punning suggestion from his daughter that the book be called ''Ill Creatures Great and Small''.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> The resulting book was a huge success, spawning numerous sequels and movies and a television adaptation. \n\nWight's books are partially autobiographical, with many of the stories loosely based on real events or people. The stories are set in the fictional town of [[Darrowby]], which is a composite of Thirsk and its nearby market towns [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[Leyburn]], and [[Middleham]].<ref>''James Herriot's Yorkshire'' (1979), James Herriot, St. Martin's</ref> Wight renamed Donald Sinclair and his brother [[Brian Sinclair (veterinary surgeon)|Brian]] as Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name \"Helen Alderson\" for his wife Joan Danbury.  Wight's son James stated in his memoir that many of the stories which are set in the 1930s\u20131950s in the books were inspired by cases that Wight attended in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=\"memoir\" /> \n\nThe books also document a transitional period in Britain's veterinary profession. Agriculture was moving from the use of draught animals (primarily horses) to the use of mechanical tractors, and medical science was on the verge of discovering antibiotics and other drugs that eliminated many of the ancient remedies still in use. These and other sociological factors (such as increased affluence) prompted a large-scale shift in veterinary practice over the course of the 20th century. At the beginning of the century, virtually all of a veterinarian's time was spent working with large animals such as horses, cattle and other livestock. By 2000, the majority of vets practised mostly on dogs, cats, and other pets belonging to a population having a larger disposable income. Wight (as Herriot) occasionally steps out of his narrative to comment on the primitive state of veterinary medicine at the time of the story he is relating.<ref name=\"thelordgodmadethemall:caesarian\">{{cite book|last1=Herriot|first1=James|title=The Lord God Made Them All|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=62\u201376}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''If Only They Could Talk'', Wight wrote seven more books. In the United States, the first six books of the original series were thought too short to publish independently and were collected into omnibus volumes: the final two books were published separately. The last book of the series, ''Every Living Thing'', immediately went into the top 10 best-seller list in Britain and had an 865,000 copy first edition printing in the United States.<ref name=\"But it did happen to a vet\">Margolis, Jonathan (12 December 2002 ''Time Magazine''{{Failed verification|date=March 2012}}<!--no such issue date, no such title in the magazine's online article index--></ref> \n\n[[File:AllCreaturesGreatAndSmallSet-1-GCR 7908.JPG|thumb|Part of the [[BBC]] TV set for ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' on permanent display at the [[World of James Herriot]] museum in Thirsk, North Yorkshire]]\n\n==Film and television adaptions==\nWight's books have been adapted for film and television, including the 1975 film ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (film)|All Creatures Great and Small]]'' followed by ''[[It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet]]'' in 1976, and the long-running [[BBC]] television series ''[[All Creatures Great and Small (TV series)|All Creatures Great and Small]]''.

Freight transport figures were particularly high on transport Routes 3, 5 and 9, which saw a combined total of 105 million tonnes carried in 2008. Further, Ukrzaliznytsia served around 518.8&nbsp;million passengers over the course of the year. The state railways ran with an annual consolidated budget of a little more than 40&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$5&nbsp;billion) in 2008.\n\nBy the end of 2005 the railways had produced a profit equivalent to 1.76&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$220&nbsp;million) from all their operations including freight, passenger service, associated services and the operation of subsidiaries. The total capital invested in fixed assets of the State Railways is thought to be equivalent to around 22&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$4.4&nbsp;billion). However, depreciation of these fixed assets is estimated to be around 57%, or in terms of rolling stock, closer to 66.7%.\n\nIn 2019, Ukrainian Railway confirms intention to issue new Eurobond. Ukrainian Railway (RAILUA) has the potential to increase its debt by [[United States dollar|US$]]1 billion, indicating a possible [[Eurobond (external bond)|Eurobond]] issue. Recall, Ukrainian Railway's existing US$500 million Eurobond will be amortized by US$150M both in March and September 2019 and then by US$50M semi-annually between March 2020 and September 2021. He also confirmed that Ukrainian Railway is now considering a Eurobond issue, on which he can further comment as soon as the government publishes a respective resolution (on its parameters). Kravtsov also highlighted that it's important for investors to have a clear understanding on how the borrowing will be serviced. Taking this into account, Ukrainian Railway has proposed a mechanism of automatic adjustment of freight railway rates based on Ukraine's producer price index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inventure.com.ua/en/news/ukraine/ukrainian-railway-confirms-intention-to-issue-new-eurobond|title=Ukrainian Railway confirms intention to issue new Eurobond|website=inventure.com.ua|language=en|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>\n\nUkrainian State Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) is the fourth company of the most profitable companies in [[Ukraine]] with a revenue of [[Ukrainian hryvnia|UAH]] 74 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biz.censor.net.ua/resonance/3084420/200_nayiblshih_kompanyi_ukrani_2017_roku|title=200 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 2017 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443|last=\u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440|website=\u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440|language=ru|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative structure ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Railways (subdivisions).png|thumb|260x260px|Subdivisions of Ukrainian Railways|alt=]]\nThe railways are split into six territorial railway companies: Donetsk, [[Lviv Railways|Lviv]], Odessa, [[Southern Railways (Ukraine)|Southern]], [[Southwestern Railways|South-Western]] and Near-Dnipro.

Freight transport figures were particularly high on transport Routes 3, 5 and 9, which saw a combined total of 105 million tonnes carried in 2008. Further, Ukrzaliznytsia served around 518.8&nbsp;million passengers over the course of the year. The state railways ran with an annual consolidated budget of a little more than 40&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$5&nbsp;billion) in 2008.\n\nBy the end of 2005 the railways had produced a profit equivalent to 1.76&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$220&nbsp;million) from all their operations including freight, passenger service, associated services and the operation of subsidiaries. The total capital invested in fixed assets of the State Railways is thought to be equivalent to around 22&nbsp;billion \u20b4 (US$4.4&nbsp;billion). However, depreciation of these fixed assets is estimated to be around 57%, or in terms of rolling stock, closer to 66.7%.\n\nIn 2019, Ukrainian Railway confirms intention to issue new Eurobond. Ukrainian Railway (RAILUA) has the potential to increase its debt by [[United States dollar|US$]]1 billion, indicating a possible [[Eurobond (external bond)|Eurobond]] issue. Recall, Ukrainian Railway's existing US$500 million Eurobond will be amortized by US$150M both in March and September 2019 and then by US$50M semi-annually between March 2020 and September 2021. He also confirmed that Ukrainian Railway is now considering a Eurobond issue, on which he can further comment as soon as the government publishes a respective resolution (on its parameters). Kravtsov also highlighted that it's important for investors to have a clear understanding on how the borrowing will be serviced. Taking this into account, Ukrainian Railway has proposed a mechanism of automatic adjustment of freight railway rates based on Ukraine's producer price index.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inventure.com.ua/en/news/ukraine/ukrainian-railway-confirms-intention-to-issue-new-eurobond|title=Ukrainian Railway confirms intention to issue new Eurobond|website=inventure.com.ua|language=en|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>\n\nUkrainian State Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia) is the fourth company of the most profitable companies in [[Ukraine]] with a revenue of [[Ukrainian hryvnia|UAH]] 74 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biz.censor.net.ua/resonance/3084420/200_nayiblshih_kompanyi_ukrani_2017_roku|title=200 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 2017 \u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443|last=\u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440|website=\u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440|language=ru|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Administrative structure ===\n[[File:Ukrainian Railways (subdivisions).png|thumb|260x260px|Subdivisions of Ukrainian Railways|alt=]]\nThe railways are split into six territorial railway companies: Donetsk, [[Lviv Railways|Lviv]], Odessa, [[Southern Railways (Ukraine)|Southern]], [[Southwestern Railways|South-Western]] and Near-Dnipro.

North of the [[Mississippi River]], I-74 bisects [[Bettendorf, Iowa|Bettendorf]] and [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]].\n\n===Illinois===\n[[Image:Murray Baker Bridge from Caterpillar Lot, Peoria, Illinois.jpg|thumb|right|[[Murray Baker Bridge]] over the [[Illinois River]] in [[Peoria, Illinois]].]]\n{{Main|Interstate 74 in Illinois}}\nIn the state of [[Illinois]], Interstate 74 runs south from [[Moline, Illinois|Moline]] to [[Galesburg, Illinois|Galesburg]]; from this point it runs southeast through [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] to the [[Bloomington-Normal, Illinois|Bloomington-Normal]] area and [[Interstate 55]]. I-74 continues southeast to the [[Champaign-Urbana, Illinois|Champaign-Urbana]] area, intersecting with [[Interstate 57]]. The interstate then runs east past [[Danville, Illinois|Danville]] at the Illinois-Indiana state line. [[U.S. Route 150]] parallels Interstate 74 in Illinois for its entire length, save the last few miles on the eastern end (in Danville, when US 150 turns south on Illinois 1), where it parallels [[U.S. Route 136]].\n\n===Indiana===\n{{Main|Interstate 74 in Indiana}}\nIn the state of [[Indiana]], Interstate 74 runs east from the Illinois state line to the [[Crawfordsville, Indiana|Crawfordsville]] area before turning southeast. It then runs around the city center of [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] along [[Interstate 465]]. Once I-74 reaches the southeast side of Indianapolis it diverges from I-465 and continues to the southeast. It then enters Ohio in Harrison, Ohio.\n\n===Ohio===\n{{Main|Interstate 74 in Ohio}}\nIn the state of [[Ohio]], Interstate 74 runs southeast from the Indiana border to the western segment's current eastern terminus at [[Interstate 75]] just north of downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. It is also signed with [[U.S. Route 52]] for its entire length. While planned to continue through West Virginia and Virginia to [[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|the Interstate 74]] section in North Carolina, the route remains unsigned or [[List of gaps in Interstate Highways|unbuilt]] past Cincinnati. At this point, I-74 would follow [[U.S. Route 52 in Ohio|U.S. Route 52]] east from Cincinnati and the current [[Interstate 74 (west)|Interstate 74]].\n\n===North Carolina===\n{{Main|Interstate 74 in North Carolina}}\nIn the state of [[North Carolina]], as of the end of 2018, I-74 exists in several segments, starting with a concurrency with [[Interstate 77 in North Carolina|I-77]] at the Virginia border. This includes the most western portion from [[Interstate 77]] to [[US 52]] just south of [[Mount Airy, North Carolina|Mount Airy]], a segment first opened to traffic as a bypass of High Point then extended west to I-40 east of Winston-Salem and east to [[Interstate 73]] near [[Randleman, North Carolina|Randleman]], then another along the southern segment of [[Interstate 73]] and [[U.S. Route 220]] from just north of [[Asheboro, North Carolina|Asheboro]] to south of [[Ellerbe, North Carolina|Ellerbe]], and finally a more eastern segment that runs from [[Laurinburg, North Carolina|Laurinburg]] to an end at NC 41 near [[Lumberton, North Carolina|Lumberton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The latest segment to be signed, from I-40 to High Point, occurred after the federal government approved signing this section as I-74 in the summer of 2013, despite the highway not being up to current interstate standards. It was uncertain why the Federal Highway Administration made an exception, but this might have been the result of a misinterpretation when a state highway administrator asked for interstate designation for another section and \"Future Interstate\" for the section already completed that did not meet standards.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mistaken Identity|last=Young|first=Wesley|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=August 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\n\n===Southeast extension===\n{{see also|U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|Interstate 77 in Virginia}}\n\n[[File:I73-I74End-Ellerbe.jpg|thumb|right|200px|I-73/I-74 end near [[Ellerbe, North Carolina|Ellerbe, NC]]]]\n\nThe 1991 plan to build [[Interstate 73]] soon included an extension of I-74 from where it ended in [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] to I-73 at [[Portsmouth, Ohio]], possibly along [[Ohio State Route 32]].<ref>{{cite news|title=I-73 Plan Would Link I-74 with Ohio 32|last=Hunter|first=Ginny|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=March 28, 1991|page=1}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1991, the [[United States Congress]] passed the $151 billion [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act]] that included the [[I-73/74 North-South Corridor]] and made I-73 a priority and included an extension of I-74 from Hamilton County to I-73 at Portsmouth.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress Puts I-74 on Fast Lane to Coast|last=Condo|first=Adam|work=The Cincinnati Post|date=November 30, 1991|page=7A}}</ref>\n\nOn August 31, 1992, the Ohio Turnpike Commission passed a resolution to study making the extension of I-74 a toll road.

These include building the first part of a bypass of [[Rockingham, North Carolina|Rockingham]] with Interstate 73 by reconstructing US 220 to interstate standards for 4 miles south of Ellerbe and is scheduled to be completed in 2018<ref name=\"Seg11\">{{cite web |last= Malme |first= Robert H. |year= 2015 |url= http://www.gribblenation.net/i7374nc/i73seg11.html |title= I-73 Segment&nbsp;11 |work= Gribble Nation |accessdate= May 30, 2015}}{{self-published source|date=February 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|certain=yes|date=February 2017}} and the first segment of the Eastern Half of the [[Winston-Salem Beltway|Winston-Salem Northern Beltway]] which is constructing {{convert|4|mi|km}} of the future I-74 freeway between Business 40/US 421 and U.S. 158, this project should also be completed by 2018.<ref name=\"Seg4\">{{cite web |last= Malme |first= Robert H. |year= 2015 |url=http://www.gribblenation.net/i7374nc/i74seg4.html|title=I-74 Segment&nbsp;4 |work= Gribble Nation |accessdate= May 30, 2015}}{{self-published source|date=February 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|certain=yes|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe proposed path of I-74 east of I-95 in North Carolina is still being debated.

It is an auxiliary route of parent [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]] that also carries portions of [[U.S. Route 24 in Indiana|US Highway&nbsp;24]] (US&nbsp;24), [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]], and [[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|US&nbsp;33]] around the urban parts of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]]. It is {{Convert|30.83|mi||abbr=}} in length.  The Interstate was originally conceived as a bypass for US&nbsp;24 around the south and east ends of Fort Wayne. Due to heavy traffic on US&nbsp;30 through the city, support was gained to connect the bypass to I-69 on the city's north end.  I-469 was given the name '''Ronald Reagan Expressway''' in 2005.\n\nI-469 was the most expensive civic project in the history of [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]], costing over $207 million. As a bypass route, I-469 has been ineffective at helping with north\u2013south traffic along I-69. However, the route has served effectively as an east\u2013west bypass around the city, removing heavy truck traffic from passing through Fort Wayne.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-469 East - Exit 0AB - I-69 US33 North (40221693010).jpg|left|thumb|I-469 at its southern terminus with I-69]]\nI-469 begins at I-69 exit&nbsp;296 and Lafayette Center Road in southwestern [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]]. The freeway heads east as a four-lane freeway, [[concurrency (road)|running concurrently]] with US&nbsp;33. The highway begins to turn southeast, passing through farmland. The route has a [[diamond interchange]] at Lafayette Center Road East and at Indianapolis Road, before turning due east and passing just south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]]. The next interchange is at the northern terminus of the southern section of [[Indiana State Road 1|State Road 1]] (SR&nbsp;1) and serves the airport via Bluffton Road. After curving northeasterly, I-469 has an interchange with Winchester Road and another with [[U.S. Route 27 in Indiana|US&nbsp;27]]. At the interchange with US&nbsp;27, US&nbsp;33 leaves I-469 heading south concurrently with US&nbsp;27.<ref name=\"INDOT 2012\">{{INDOT map|year=2012|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe freeway then curves northeasterly, with interchanges at Marion Center Road and Tillman Road. Then, I-469 passes southeast of [[New Haven, Indiana|New Haven]], with an interchange at Minnich Road. After the Minnich Road exit, the road begins to curve due north along the east side of New Haven. The freeway has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]]/[[Indiana State Road 930|SR&nbsp;930]], at SR 930's eastern terminus;  US&nbsp;30 begins running concurrently with I-469. After the interchange at US&nbsp;30 is a bridge over [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] railroad tracks and an interchange with US&nbsp;24. This is the eastern end of the concurrency with US&nbsp;24.<ref name=\"INDOT 2012\" /><ref name=\"RR map\">{{INDOT ref|title=RR Map|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nI-469 proceeds north, concurrent with both US&nbsp;24 and US&nbsp;30. The freeway crosses the [[Maumee River]] and begins to curve to the northwest, entering commercial areas. The next interchange is with the southern terminus of the northern section of [[Indiana State Road 37|SR&nbsp;37]], after which the route enters residential areas with a small amount of farmland. The highway then curves further west to an interchange at Maplecrest Road. At I-469's northern terminus, it has an interchange with I-69; US&nbsp;24 and US&nbsp;30 continue to the south along I-69.<ref name=\"INDOT 2012\" />\n\n=== Traffic flow ===\nI-469 is maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] (INDOT). As of 2017, I-469's [[annual average daily traffic]] was 46,161 vehicles per day between Maplecrest Road and I-469's northern terminus, 34,651 near its interchange with US&nbsp;30, 14,821 near its interchange with Marion Center Road, and 22,142 between the highway's southern terminus and its interchange with Lafayette Center Road East. By comparison, in 2017 I-69 saw over 60,000 vehicles per day in a majority of sections between the termini of I-469.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indot.ms2soft.com/tcds/tsearch.asp?loc=Indot&mod=|title=Traffic Count Database System|author=Indiana Department of Transportation|publisher= Indiana Department of Transportation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628170649/http://indot.ms2soft.com/tcds/tsearch.asp?loc=Indot&mod=|archive-date=June 28, 2018|url-status = live|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA 2007 traffic count along I-469 found that only one section of the highway, between Maplecrest Road and I-469's northern terminus, saw traffic numbers close to anywhere along I-69's route around the city, while other sections are much more lightly traveled. John Stafford, who formerly worked for Allen County Plan Commission during planning for I-469, stated in 2008 that the highway was relatively new and would eventually spur growth. Since its construction, I-469 has been ineffective as a north\u2013south bypass around Fort Wayne, in part because its length is {{convert|12|mi|km}} longer than I-69's route around the city.  However, officials have stated that heavy truck traffic along [[Indiana State Road 930|Coliseum Boulevard]] has almost entirely disappeared, and some have stated that I-469 functions better as an east-west bypass around Fort Wayne.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-469 West US33 North Signs - MM8 (40221692820).jpg|thumb|I-469 West near mile marker 8]]\nIn the 1950s, Coliseum Boulevard was built as a \"circumurban\" highway, and US&nbsp;30 was rerouted onto it to bypass the downtown area of Fort Wayne.<ref name=\"busy Coliseum Boulevard\">{{cite news |url = http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090924/NEWS/909240315/0/FRONTPAGE |title = We Need Solution for Indiana 930 |last = Leininger |first = Kevin |date = September 8, 2009 |newspaper = [[The News-Sentinel]] |accessdate = November 19, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170917171435/http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090924%2FNEWS%2F909240315%2F0%2FFRONTPAGE |archive-date = September 17, 2017 |location = Fort Wayne |oclc = 8807796 |url-status = dead |df = }}</ref> I-69 was constructed in the 1960s around the west side of the city;<ref name=\":0\" /> its first section opened in October 1962.<ref>{{cite book |title = History of the Interstate System in Indiana |volume = 4 |last = Ripple |first = David Alan |publisher = Purdue University |year = 1975 |location = West Lafayette, Indiana |at = Appendix, table&nbsp;41, p.&nbsp;876 |chapter = Chapters VII and VIII: Cost, Funding and General Benefits |doi = 10.5703/1288284313910 |id = Publication FHWA/IN/JHRP-75/29. }}</ref> In 1970, Eli Samaan created a transportation plan for Fort Wayne, including north\u2013south and east\u2013west expressways through the city, along with a route along the city's south and east edges. Fort Wayne mayor Ivan Lebamoff supported the east\u2013west expressway, and the route was approved by the state. However, the estimated $110 million needed for the project could not be allocated, so the project was scrapped. When the state began looking for a solution to traffic issues on US&nbsp;24 through Fort Wayne, plans for a bypass began. In large part due to heavy traffic on Coliseum Boulevard, which became known for its commercial properties and issues with [[Traffic bottleneck|bottlenecks]], the idea gained support.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe original plans for the bypass were to connect I-69 to US&nbsp;24 east of Fort Wayne.  By 1981, these plans were expanded to connect to I-69 on the city's north side. Samaan stated that he had to convince Governor [[Otis Bowen]] in 1978 to expedite construction of the bypass. An additional factor appeared as contracts for the project were being awarded, when [[General Motors]] announced construction of an automotive plant in 1984 on Lafayette Center Road, where the bypass was planned to interchange with I-69. According to Samaan, this helped to accelerate construction when the state decided it would be beneficial to the new employer in the area, stating \"I never have seen anything move that fast in my whole life.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nConstruction began in 1988, with the first section built between I-69 and Lafayette Center Road.

It is an auxiliary route of parent [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]] that also carries portions of [[U.S. Route 24 in Indiana|US Highway&nbsp;24]] (US&nbsp;24), [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]], and [[U.S. Route 33 in Indiana|US&nbsp;33]] around the urban parts of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]]. It is {{Convert|30.83|mi||abbr=}} in length.  The Interstate was originally conceived as a bypass for US&nbsp;24 around the south and east ends of Fort Wayne. Due to heavy traffic on US&nbsp;30 through the city, support was gained to connect the bypass to I-69 on the city's north end.  I-469 was given the name '''Ronald Reagan Expressway''' in 2005.\n\nI-469 was the most expensive civic project in the history of [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]], costing over $207 million. As a bypass route, I-469 has been ineffective at helping with north\u2013south traffic along I-69. However, the route has served effectively as an east\u2013west bypass around the city, removing heavy truck traffic from passing through Fort Wayne.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-469 East - Exit 0AB - I-69 US33 North (40221693010).jpg|left|thumb|I-469 at its southern terminus with I-69]]\nI-469 begins at I-69 exit&nbsp;296 and Lafayette Center Road in southwestern [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]]. The freeway heads east as a four-lane freeway, [[concurrency (road)|running concurrently]] with US&nbsp;33. The highway begins to turn southeast, passing through farmland. The route has a [[diamond interchange]] at Lafayette Center Road East and at Indianapolis Road, before turning due east and passing just south of [[Fort Wayne International Airport]]. The next interchange is at the northern terminus of the southern section of [[Indiana State Road 1|State Road 1]] (SR&nbsp;1) and serves the airport via Bluffton Road. After curving northeasterly, I-469 has an interchange with Winchester Road and another with [[U.S. Route 27 in Indiana|US&nbsp;27]]. At the interchange with US&nbsp;27, US&nbsp;33 leaves I-469 heading south concurrently with US&nbsp;27.<ref name=\"INDOT 2012\">{{INDOT map|year=2012|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe freeway then curves northeasterly, with interchanges at Marion Center Road and Tillman Road. Then, I-469 passes southeast of [[New Haven, Indiana|New Haven]], with an interchange at Minnich Road. After the Minnich Road exit, the road begins to curve due north along the east side of New Haven. The freeway has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 30 in Indiana|US&nbsp;30]]/[[Indiana State Road 930|SR&nbsp;930]], at SR 930's eastern terminus;  US&nbsp;30 begins running concurrently with I-469. After the interchange at US&nbsp;30 is a bridge over [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] railroad tracks and an interchange with US&nbsp;24. This is the eastern end of the concurrency with US&nbsp;24.<ref name=\"INDOT 2012\" /><ref name=\"RR map\">{{INDOT ref|title=RR Map|accessdate=September 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nI-469 proceeds north, concurrent with both US&nbsp;24 and US&nbsp;30. The freeway crosses the [[Maumee River]] and begins to curve to the northwest, entering commercial areas. The next interchange is with the southern terminus of the northern section of [[Indiana State Road 37|SR&nbsp;37]], after which the route enters residential areas with a small amount of farmland. The highway then curves further west to an interchange at Maplecrest Road. At I-469's northern terminus, it has an interchange with I-69; US&nbsp;24 and US&nbsp;30 continue to the south along I-69.<ref name=\"INDOT 2012\" />\n\n=== Traffic flow ===\nI-469 is maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]] (INDOT). As of 2017, I-469's [[annual average daily traffic]] was 46,161 vehicles per day between Maplecrest Road and I-469's northern terminus, 34,651 near its interchange with US&nbsp;30, 14,821 near its interchange with Marion Center Road, and 22,142 between the highway's southern terminus and its interchange with Lafayette Center Road East. By comparison, in 2017 I-69 saw over 60,000 vehicles per day in a majority of sections between the termini of I-469.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indot.ms2soft.com/tcds/tsearch.asp?loc=Indot&mod=|title=Traffic Count Database System|author=Indiana Department of Transportation|publisher= Indiana Department of Transportation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628170649/http://indot.ms2soft.com/tcds/tsearch.asp?loc=Indot&mod=|archive-date=June 28, 2018|url-status = live|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA 2007 traffic count along I-469 found that only one section of the highway, between Maplecrest Road and I-469's northern terminus, saw traffic numbers close to anywhere along I-69's route around the city, while other sections are much more lightly traveled. John Stafford, who formerly worked for Allen County Plan Commission during planning for I-469, stated in 2008 that the highway was relatively new and would eventually spur growth. Since its construction, I-469 has been ineffective as a north\u2013south bypass around Fort Wayne, in part because its length is {{convert|12|mi|km}} longer than I-69's route around the city.  However, officials have stated that heavy truck traffic along [[Indiana State Road 930|Coliseum Boulevard]] has almost entirely disappeared, and some have stated that I-469 functions better as an east-west bypass around Fort Wayne.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-469 West US33 North Signs - MM8 (40221692820).jpg|thumb|I-469 West near mile marker 8]]\nIn the 1950s, Coliseum Boulevard was built as a \"circumurban\" highway, and US&nbsp;30 was rerouted onto it to bypass the downtown area of Fort Wayne.<ref name=\"busy Coliseum Boulevard\">{{cite news |url = http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090924/NEWS/909240315/0/FRONTPAGE |title = We Need Solution for Indiana 930 |last = Leininger |first = Kevin |date = September 8, 2009 |newspaper = [[The News-Sentinel]] |accessdate = November 19, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170917171435/http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090924%2FNEWS%2F909240315%2F0%2FFRONTPAGE |archive-date = September 17, 2017 |location = Fort Wayne |oclc = 8807796 |url-status = dead |df = }}</ref> I-69 was constructed in the 1960s around the west side of the city;<ref name=\":0\" /> its first section opened in October 1962.<ref>{{cite book |title = History of the Interstate System in Indiana |volume = 4 |last = Ripple |first = David Alan |publisher = Purdue University |year = 1975 |location = West Lafayette, Indiana |at = Appendix, table&nbsp;41, p.&nbsp;876 |chapter = Chapters VII and VIII: Cost, Funding and General Benefits |doi = 10.5703/1288284313910 |id = Publication FHWA/IN/JHRP-75/29. }}</ref> In 1970, Eli Samaan created a transportation plan for Fort Wayne, including north\u2013south and east\u2013west expressways through the city, along with a route along the city's south and east edges. Fort Wayne mayor Ivan Lebamoff supported the east\u2013west expressway, and the route was approved by the state. However, the estimated $110 million needed for the project could not be allocated, so the project was scrapped. When the state began looking for a solution to traffic issues on US&nbsp;24 through Fort Wayne, plans for a bypass began. In large part due to heavy traffic on Coliseum Boulevard, which became known for its commercial properties and issues with [[Traffic bottleneck|bottlenecks]], the idea gained support.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe original plans for the bypass were to connect I-69 to US&nbsp;24 east of Fort Wayne.  By 1981, these plans were expanded to connect to I-69 on the city's north side. Samaan stated that he had to convince Governor [[Otis Bowen]] in 1978 to expedite construction of the bypass. An additional factor appeared as contracts for the project were being awarded, when [[General Motors]] announced construction of an automotive plant in 1984 on Lafayette Center Road, where the bypass was planned to interchange with I-69. According to Samaan, this helped to accelerate construction when the state decided it would be beneficial to the new employer in the area, stating \"I never have seen anything move that fast in my whole life.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nConstruction began in 1988, with the first section built between I-69 and Lafayette Center Road.

Some populations have only multiple-male groups as mixed sex groups, while others have only one-male groups as mixed sexed groups.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 1992\"/>\n\nSome evidence suggests multiple-male groups are temporary and exist only after a takeover, and subsequently split into one-male and all-male groups.<ref name=r7/>\n\nSocial hierarchies exist for all group types.<ref name= \"Srivastava 1992\"/><ref name= \"Rajpurohit 2005\"/> In all-male groups, dominance is attained through aggression and mating success.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 2008\"/> With sexually mature females, rank is based on physical condition and age.<ref name=\"Koenig 2000\"/><ref name= \"Borries 1991\"/> The younger the female, the higher the rank. Dominance rituals are most common among high-ranking langurs.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 2005\"/> Most changes in social rank in males take place during changes in group members. An adult male may remain in a one-male group for 45 months.<ref name= \"Newton 1987\"/> The rate of male replacement can occur quickly or slowly depending on the group.<ref name=r8/>\n\nFemales within a group are matrilineally related. Female memberships are also stable, but less so in larger groups.<ref name= \"Newton 1994\"/><ref name=\"Koenig 2000\"/> Relationships between the females tend to be friendly. They will do various activities with each together, such as foraging, traveling and resting. They will also groom each other regardless of their rank. However, higher-ranking females give out and receive grooming the most.<ref name=r9/> In addition, females groom males more often than the other way around.<ref name=r10/> Male and female relationships are usually positive. Relationships between males can range from peaceful to violent. While females remain in their natal groups, males will leave when they reach adulthood.<ref name= \"Newton 1994\"/> Relationships between groups tend to be hostile. High-ranking males from different groups will display, vocalize, and fight among themselves.\n\n===Reproduction and parenting===\n\n[[File:Juvenile Indian Grey Langur.jpg|thumb|Juvenile gray langur]]\n[[File:Semnopithecus priam.jpg|thumb|right|Tufted gray langur with young]]\n[[File:GrayLangurWithNewBorn1.JPG|thumb|Gray langur with newborn]]\nIn one-male groups, the resident male is usually the sole breeder of the females and sires all the young. In multiple-male groups, the highest-ranking male fathers most of the offspring, followed by the next-ranking males and even outside males will father young.<ref name=r11/> Higher-ranking females are more reproductively successful than lower-ranking ones.<ref name= \"Borries 1991\"/>\n\nFemale gray langurs do not make it obvious that they are in [[estrous]]. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the reproduction state of females.<ref name=r12/> Females signal that they are ready to mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their anogenital regions.<ref name= \"Sommer 1992\"/> Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members.<ref name= \"Newton 1987\"/> Females have even been recorded mounting other females.<ref name=b1/>\n\nThe [[gestation]] period of gray langur lasts around 200 days, at least at Jodhpur, India. In some areas, reproduction is year-around.<ref name= \"Sommer 1992\"/> Year-round reproduction appears to occur in populations that capitalize on human-made foods. Other populations have seasonal reproduction.<ref name= \"Newton 1987\"/>\n\n[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] is common among gray langurs. Most infanticidal langurs are males that have recently immigrated to a group and driven out the prior male. These males only kill infants that are not their own.<ref name=b2/> Infanticide is more commonly reported in one-male groups, perhaps because one male monopolizing matings drives the evolution of this trait. In multiple-male groups, the costs for infanticidal males are likely to be high as the other males may protect the infants and they can't ensure that they'll sire young with other males around. Nevertheless, infanticide does occur in these groups, and is suggested that such practices serve to return a female to estrous and gain the opportunity to mate.<ref name= \"Borries 1997\"/>\n\nFemales usually give birth to a single infant, although twins do occur. Most births occur during the night.<ref name= \"Agoramoorthy 1992\"/> Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attached to their mothers' chests and mostly just suckle or sleep.<ref name= \"Sugiyama 1965\"/> They do not move much in terms of locomotion for the first two weeks of their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more.<ref name=r13/> They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. [[Alloparenting]] occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows.<ref name= \"Sugiyama 1965\"/> Langurs are weaned by 13 months.\n\n===Vocalizations===\nGray langurs are recorded to make a number of vocalizations:<ref name= \"Bhaker 2004\"/><ref name= \"Hohmann 1989\"/>\n*loud calls or whoops made only by adult males during displays;\n*harsh barks made by adult and subadult males when surprised by a predator;\n*cough barks made by adults and subadults during group movements;\n*grunt barks made mostly by adult males during group movements and agonistic interactions;\n*rumble screams made in agonistic interactions;\n*pant barks made with loud calls when groups are interacting;\n*grunts made in many different situations, usually in agonistic ones;\n*honks made by adult males when groups are interacting;\n*rumbles made during approaches, embraces, and mounts;\n*hiccups made by most members of a group when they find another group.\n\n==Status and conservation==\nGray langurs have stable populations in some areas and declining ones in others.<ref name=r14/> Both the [[black-footed gray langur]] and [[Kashmir gray langur]] are considered [[Threatened species|threatened]].<ref name=IUCNKashmir/><ref>{{Cite iucn | author = Singh, M. | author2 = Molur, S. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Semnopithecus hypoleucos'' | volume = 2008 | page = e.T39838A10275235 | date = 2008 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T39838A10275235.en }}</ref> The latter is the rarest species of gray langur, with less than 250 mature individuals remaining.<ref name=IUCNKashmir/>\n\nIn India, gray langurs number at around 300,000.<ref name=r15/> India has laws prohibiting the capturing or killing of langurs, but they are still hunted in some parts of the country.<ref name=Nag/> Enforcement of these laws has proven to be difficult and it seems most people are unaware of their protection.<ref name= \"Choudhury 2001\"/> Populations are also threatened by mining, forest fires and deforestation for wood.<ref name=r16/>\n\nLangurs can be found near roads and can become victims of automobile accidents. This happens even in protected areas, with deaths by automobile collisions making nearly a quarter of mortality in Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary in Rajasthan, India.<ref name=r17/> Langurs are considered sacred in the Hindu religion and are sometimes kept for religious purposes by Hindu priests and for roadside performances.

Despite this, research in some areas show high levels of support for the removal of langurs from villages, their sacred status no longer important.<ref name=r18/> Langurs will raid crops and steal food from houses, and this causes people to persecute them.<ref name=r18/> While people may feed them in temples, they do not extend such care to monkeys at their homes.<ref name=b3/> Langurs stealing and biting people to get food in urban areas may also contribute to more persecutions.<ref name=r19/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mammals|Animals|Primates}}\n* [[Lion-tailed macaque]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=r1>{{Cite iucn |title=''Semnopithecus schistaceus'' |author=Kumar, A. |author2=Yongzu, Z. |author3=Molur, S. |last-author-amp=yes |page=e.T39840A10275563 |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=IUCNKashmir>{{Cite iucn|title=''Semnopithecus ajax'' |author=Groves, C.P. |author2=Molur, S. |last-author-amp=yes |page=e.T39833A10274370 |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Burnie\">Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), ''Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife''.

(1977) ''Primates of South Asia: ecology, sociobiology, and behavior''.

They are found at sea level to altitudes up to {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=r1/><ref name=IUCNKashmir/> They can adapt well to human settlements, and are found in villages, towns and areas with housing or agriculture.<ref name= \"Bennett 1994\"/> They live in densely populated cities like [[Jodhpur]], which has a population numbering up to a million.<ref name=r2/>\n\n== Ecology and behavior ==\nGray langurs are [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. They sleep during the night in trees but also on man-made structures like towers and electric poles when in human settlements.<ref name=r3/> When resting in trees, they generally prefer the highest branches.<ref name=r4/>\n\n[[Ungulate]]s like [[bovine]] and [[deer]] will eat food dropped by foraging langurs.<ref name=r5/> Langurs are preyed upon by [[Indian leopard|leopards]], [[dhole]]s and [[Bengal tiger|tigers]].<ref>Boggess, JE.

However, unlike some other colobines they do not depend on leaves and leaf buds of herbs, but will also eat [[conifer]]ous needles and cones, fruits and fruit buds, evergreen [[petiole (botany)|petioles]], shoots and roots, seeds, grass, [[bamboo]], [[fern]] rhizomes, [[moss]]es, and [[lichen]]s. Leaves of trees and shrubs rank at the top of preferred food, followed by herbs and grasses. Non-plant material consumed include spider webs, termite mounds and insect larvae.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Srivastava | first1 = A. | title = Insectivory and its significance to langur diets | doi = 10.1007/BF02381181 | journal = Primates | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 237\u2013241 | year = 1991 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> They forage on agricultural crops and other human foods, and even accept handouts.<ref name= \"Vogel 1977\"/> Although they occasionally drink, langurs get most of their water from the moisture in their food.<ref name=r6/>\n\n===Social structure===\n\n[[File:GREY LANGUR.jpg|thumb|Gray langur]]\nGray langurs exist in three types of groups:\n* one-male groups, comprising one adult male, several females and offspring;\n* multiple-male groups, comprising males and females of all ages;\n* all-male groups.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 1992\"/><ref name= \"Newton 1994\"/>\nAll-male groups tend to be the smallest of the groups and can consist of adults, subadults, and juveniles. Some populations have only multiple-male groups as mixed sex groups, while others have only one-male groups as mixed sexed groups.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 1992\"/>\n\nSome evidence suggests multiple-male groups are temporary and exist only after a takeover, and subsequently split into one-male and all-male groups.<ref name=r7/>\n\nSocial hierarchies exist for all group types.<ref name= \"Srivastava 1992\"/><ref name= \"Rajpurohit 2005\"/> In all-male groups, dominance is attained through aggression and mating success.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 2008\"/> With sexually mature females, rank is based on physical condition and age.<ref name=\"Koenig 2000\"/><ref name= \"Borries 1991\"/> The younger the female, the higher the rank. Dominance rituals are most common among high-ranking langurs.<ref name= \"Rajpurohit 2005\"/> Most changes in social rank in males take place during changes in group members. An adult male may remain in a one-male group for 45 months.<ref name= \"Newton 1987\"/> The rate of male replacement can occur quickly or slowly depending on the group.<ref name=r8/>\n\nFemales within a group are matrilineally related. Female memberships are also stable, but less so in larger groups.<ref name= \"Newton 1994\"/><ref name=\"Koenig 2000\"/> Relationships between the females tend to be friendly. They will do various activities with each together, such as foraging, traveling and resting. They will also groom each other regardless of their rank. However, higher-ranking females give out and receive grooming the most.<ref name=r9/> In addition, females groom males more often than the other way around.<ref name=r10/> Male and female relationships are usually positive. Relationships between males can range from peaceful to violent. While females remain in their natal groups, males will leave when they reach adulthood.<ref name= \"Newton 1994\"/> Relationships between groups tend to be hostile. High-ranking males from different groups will display, vocalize, and fight among themselves.\n\n===Reproduction and parenting===\n\n[[File:Juvenile Indian Grey Langur.jpg|thumb|Juvenile gray langur]]\n[[File:Semnopithecus priam.jpg|thumb|right|Tufted gray langur with young]]\n[[File:GrayLangurWithNewBorn1.JPG|thumb|Gray langur with newborn]]\nIn one-male groups, the resident male is usually the sole breeder of the females and sires all the young. In multiple-male groups, the highest-ranking male fathers most of the offspring, followed by the next-ranking males and even outside males will father young.<ref name=r11/> Higher-ranking females are more reproductively successful than lower-ranking ones.<ref name= \"Borries 1991\"/>\n\nFemale gray langurs do not make it obvious that they are in [[estrous]]. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the reproduction state of females.<ref name=r12/> Females signal that they are ready to mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their anogenital regions.<ref name= \"Sommer 1992\"/> Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members.<ref name= \"Newton 1987\"/> Females have even been recorded mounting other females.<ref name=b1/>\n\nThe [[gestation]] period of gray langur lasts around 200 days, at least at Jodhpur, India. In some areas, reproduction is year-around.<ref name= \"Sommer 1992\"/> Year-round reproduction appears to occur in populations that capitalize on human-made foods. Other populations have seasonal reproduction.<ref name= \"Newton 1987\"/>\n\n[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] is common among gray langurs. Most infanticidal langurs are males that have recently immigrated to a group and driven out the prior male. These males only kill infants that are not their own.<ref name=b2/> Infanticide is more commonly reported in one-male groups, perhaps because one male monopolizing matings drives the evolution of this trait. In multiple-male groups, the costs for infanticidal males are likely to be high as the other males may protect the infants and they can't ensure that they'll sire young with other males around. Nevertheless, infanticide does occur in these groups, and is suggested that such practices serve to return a female to estrous and gain the opportunity to mate.<ref name= \"Borries 1997\"/>\n\nFemales usually give birth to a single infant, although twins do occur. Most births occur during the night.<ref name= \"Agoramoorthy 1992\"/> Infants are born with thin, dark brown or black hair and pale skin. Infants spend their first week attached to their mothers' chests and mostly just suckle or sleep.<ref name= \"Sugiyama 1965\"/> They do not move much in terms of locomotion for the first two weeks of their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more.<ref name=r13/> They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. [[Alloparenting]] occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows.<ref name= \"Sugiyama 1965\"/> Langurs are weaned by 13 months.\n\n===Vocalizations===\nGray langurs are recorded to make a number of vocalizations:<ref name= \"Bhaker 2004\"/><ref name= \"Hohmann 1989\"/>\n*loud calls or whoops made only by adult males during displays;\n*harsh barks made by adult and subadult males when surprised by a predator;\n*cough barks made by adults and subadults during group movements;\n*grunt barks made mostly by adult males during group movements and agonistic interactions;\n*rumble screams made in agonistic interactions;\n*pant barks made with loud calls when groups are interacting;\n*grunts made in many different situations, usually in agonistic ones;\n*honks made by adult males when groups are interacting;\n*rumbles made during approaches, embraces, and mounts;\n*hiccups made by most members of a group when they find another group.\n\n==Status and conservation==\nGray langurs have stable populations in some areas and declining ones in others.<ref name=r14/> Both the [[black-footed gray langur]] and [[Kashmir gray langur]] are considered [[Threatened species|threatened]].<ref name=IUCNKashmir/><ref>{{Cite iucn | author = Singh, M. | author2 = Molur, S. | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Semnopithecus hypoleucos'' | volume = 2008 | page = e.T39838A10275235 | date = 2008 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T39838A10275235.en }}</ref> The latter is the rarest species of gray langur, with less than 250 mature individuals remaining.<ref name=IUCNKashmir/>\n\nIn India, gray langurs number at around 300,000.<ref name=r15/> India has laws prohibiting the capturing or killing of langurs, but they are still hunted in some parts of the country.<ref name=Nag/> Enforcement of these laws has proven to be difficult and it seems most people are unaware of their protection.<ref name= \"Choudhury 2001\"/> Populations are also threatened by mining, forest fires and deforestation for wood.<ref name=r16/>\n\nLangurs can be found near roads and can become victims of automobile accidents.
