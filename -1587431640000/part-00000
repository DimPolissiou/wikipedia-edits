It lays out the system of [[Classified information|classification]], [[declassification]], and handling of [[national security]] information generated by the U.S. government and its employees and contractors, as well as information received from other governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html#13526 |title=Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, ''Classified National Security Information'' |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|The National Archives]] |accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>\n\nThe desired degree of secrecy about such information is known as its [[Information sensitivity|sensitivity]]. Sensitivity is based upon a calculation of the damage to national security that the release of the information would cause. The United States has three levels of classification: Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Each level of classification indicates an increasing degree of sensitivity. Thus, if one holds a Top Secret [[security clearance]], one is allowed to handle information up to the level of Top Secret, including Secret and Confidential information. If one holds a Secret clearance, one may not then handle Top Secret information, but may handle Secret and Confidential classified information.\n\nThe United States does not have a British-style [[Official Secrets Act]]; instead, several laws protect classified information, including the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] and the [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]] of 1982. \nA 2013 report to Congress noted that the relevant laws have been mostly used to prosecute foreign agents, or those passing classified information to them, and that leaks to the press have rarely been prosecuted.<ref name=elsea/> The legislative and executive branches of government, including US presidents, have frequently leaked classified information to journalists.<ref>Stansfield Turner, ''Burn Before Reading'', 2006</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref>The Deadly Bet, Walter LaFaber</ref><ref>Seeds of Terror, Gretchen Peters</ref><ref>[http://stephenkim.org/2011/09/03/classified-information-in-woodwards-obamas-wars/ Classified Information in \"Obama's Wars\"], September 29, 2010, Jack Goldsmith, Lawfare, via stephenkim.org</ref> Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to pass a law that generally outlaws disclosing classified information. Most espionage law criminalizes only national defense information; only a jury can decide if a given document meets that criterion, and judges have repeatedly said that being \"classified\" does not necessarily make information become related to the \"national defense\".<ref name=edgsch/><ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/jud/aipac/franklin061109.html Judge T.S.

Examples include information on [[Augusto Pinochet]] to the government of [[Chile]]. In October 2015, US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] provided [[Michelle Bachelet]], Chile's president, with a [[USB flash drive|pen drive]] containing hundreds of newly declassified documents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21707587-united-states-tries-win-friends-revealing-past-misdeeds-sunlight-diplomacy|title=Sunlight diplomacy|date=2016-09-24|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) 2011 Annual Report to the President.pdf|thumb|page=12|Derivative classification activity 1996\u20132011]]\nIn the U.S., information is called \"classified\" if it has been assigned one of the three levels: Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Information that is not so labeled is called \"Unclassified information\". The term ''declassified'' is used for information that has had its classification removed, and ''downgraded'' refers to information that has been assigned a lower classification level but is still classified. Many documents are automatically downgraded and then declassified after some number of years.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The U.S. government uses the terms ''[[Sensitive but unclassified|Sensitive But Unclassified]]'' (SBU), ''[[Sensitive Security Information]]'' (SSI), ''Critical Program Information'' (CPI), ''For Official Use Only'' (FOUO), or ''Law Enforcement Sensitive'' (LES) to refer to information that is not Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret, but whose dissemination is still restricted. Reasons for such restrictions can include [[Wassenaar Arrangement|export controls]], [[privacy]] regulations, court orders, and ongoing criminal investigations, as well as national security. Information that was never classified is sometimes referred to as \"open source\" by those who work in classified activities. ''Public Safety Sensitive'' (PSS) refers to information that is similar to Law Enforcement Sensitive but could be shared between the various public safety disciplines (Law Enforcement, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services).

Having Top Secret clearance does not allow one to view all Top Secret documents. The user of the information must possess the clearance necessary for the sensitivity of the information, as well as a [[need to know|legitimate need]] to obtain the information. For example, all US military pilots are required to obtain at least a Secret clearance, but they may only access documents directly related to their orders. Secret information might have additional access controls that could prevent someone with a Top Secret clearance from seeing it.{{citation needed lead|date=October 2014}}\n\nSince all federal departments are part of the Executive Branch, the classification system is governed by Executive Order rather than by law. Typically each president will issue a new executive order, either tightening classification or loosening it. The Clinton administration made a major change in the classification system by issuing an executive order that for the first time required all classified documents to be declassified after 25 years unless they were reviewed by the agency that created the information and determined to require continuing classification.<ref>EXECUTIVE ORDER 12958 https://fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12958.html</ref>\n\n===Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data===\n\nRestricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are classification markings that concern nuclear information. These are the only two classifications that are established by federal law, being defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Nuclear information is not automatically declassified after 25 years. Documents with nuclear information covered under the Atomic Energy Act will be marked with a classification level (confidential, secret or top secret) and a restricted data or formerly restricted data marking. Nuclear information as specified in the act may inadvertently appear in unclassified documents and must be reclassified when discovered. Even documents created by private individuals have been seized for containing nuclear information and classified. Only the Department of Energy may declassify nuclear information.<ref>CLASSIFICATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS-RELATED INFORMATION, http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/hss/Classification/docs/CTI-Training-RD-FRD-Briefing.pdf</ref>\n\n===Code Word classifications===\nTop Secret is the highest level of classification. However some information is compartmentalized by adding a code word so that only those who have been cleared for each code word can see it. This information is also known as \"[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]]\" (SCI). A document marked SECRET (CODE WORD) could be viewed only by a person with a secret or top secret clearance and that specific code word clearance. Each code word deals with a different kind of information. The CIA administers code word clearances.<ref>\nIRoss Anderson. \"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, First Edition, Chapter 8.2: Compartmentation, the Chinese Wall, and the BMA Model\" www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-08.pdf</ref>\n\n===Top Secret===\n[[Image:NSALibertyReport.p13.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a U.S. classified document; page 13 of a [[United States]] [[National Security Agency]] report<ref>William D.

Certain positions which require access to sensitive information, but not information which is classified, must obtain this designation through a background check. Public Trust Positions can either be moderate-risk or high-risk.<ref name=USDA>{{cite web|title=National Security Positions vs. Public Trust Positions|url=http://www.dm.usda.gov/ohsec/pdsd/securityVStrust.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=FEDERAL SECURITY/SUITABILITY CLEARANCE CHART|url=http://fedcas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Federal-Suitability-Security-Clearance-Chart.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Unclassified===\n''Unclassified'' is not technically a classification; this is the default and refers to information that can be released to individuals without a clearance. Information that is unclassified is sometimes restricted in its dissemination as [[Sensitive But Unclassified]] (SBU) or [[For Official Use Only]] (FOUO). For example, the law enforcement bulletins reported by the U.S. media when the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] raised the U.S. [[Homeland Security Advisory System|terror threat level]] were usually classified as \"<nowiki>U//LES</nowiki>\", or \"Unclassified \u2013 Law Enforcement Sensitive\". This information is supposed to be released only to law enforcement agencies (sheriff, police, etc.), but, because the information is unclassified, it is sometimes released to the public as well. Information that is unclassified but which the government does not believe should be subject to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests is often classified as <nowiki>U//FOUO</nowiki>\u2014\"Unclassified\u2014For Official Use Only\". In addition to FOUO information, information can be categorized according to its availability to be distributed (e.g., Distribution D may only be released to approved Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Defense contractor personnel<ref>U.S. Department of Defense Directive DoDD 5230.24, March 18, 1987</ref>). Also, the statement of NOFORN (meaning \"no [[foreign national]]s\") is applied to any information that may not be released to any non-U.S. citizen. NOFORN and distribution statements are often used in conjunction with classified information or alone on SBU information. Documents subject to export controls have a specific warning to that effect. Information which is \"personally identifiable\" is governed by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]] and is also subject to strict controls regardless of its level of classification.\n\nFinally, information at one level of classification may be \"upgraded by aggregation\" to a higher level. For example, a specific technical capability of a weapons system might be classified Secret, but the aggregation of all technical capabilities of the system into a single document could be deemed Top Secret.\n\nUse of information restrictions outside the classification system is growing in the U.S. government. In September 2005 J. William Leonard, director of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]] [[Information Security Oversight Office]], was quoted in the press as saying, \"No one individual in government can identify all the controlled, unclassified [categories], let alone describe their rules.\"<ref>Michael J.

Bush issued a Presidential memorandum on May 9, 2008, in an attempt to consolidate the various designations in use into a new category known as [[Controlled Unclassified Information]] (CUI). The CUI categories and subcategories were hoped to serve as the exclusive designations for identifying unclassified information throughout the executive branch not covered by [[Executive Order 12958]] or the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] (as amended) but still required safeguarding or dissemination controls, pursuant to and consistent with any applicable laws, regulations, and government-wide policies in place at the time. CUI would replace categories such as [[Sensitive but unclassified|For Official Use Only]] (FOUO), [[Sensitive but unclassified|Sensitive But Unclassified]] (SBU) and Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES).<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Casteli\n  | first = Elise\n  | title = New policy expected soon for sensitive information\n  | newspaper = Federal Times\n  | date = January 22, 2008\n  | url = http://www.federaltimes.com/index.php?S=3323622\n  | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130102142248/http://www.federaltimes.com/index.php?S=3323622\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archive-date = January 2, 2013\n  | ref = harv}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite press release\n  | title = Memorandum For The Heads Of Executive Departments And Agencies - Designation and Sharing of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)\n  | publisher = The Office of the White House\n  | date = May 9, 2008\n  | url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/05/20080509-6.html\n  | accessdate = October 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Presidential memorandum]] also designated the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] as responsible for overseeing and managing the implementation of the new CUI framework.<ref>{{cite press release\n  | title = Archivist of the United States Establishes \"Controlled Unclassified Information Office\"\n  | publisher = The National Archives\n  | date = May 22, 2008\n  | url = https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-107.html\n  | accessdate = October 21, 2008}}\n</ref>\n\nThis memorandum has since been rescinded by [[s:Executive Order 13556|Executive Order 13556]] of November 4, 2010 and the guidelines previously outlined within the memo were expanded upon in a further attempt to improve the management of information across all federal agencies as well as establish a more standard, government-wide program regarding the controlled unclassification designation process itself.<ref name=\"eo13556\">[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&page=68675&dbname=2010_register Executive Order 13556 of November 4, 2010, ''Controlled Unclassified Information''], Federal Register - U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Vol. 75, No. 216, November 9, 2010, p. 68675.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Congress has attempted to take steps to resolve this, but did not succeed. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] passed the Reducing Information Control Designations Act {{USBill|111|HR|1323}} on March 17, 2009. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Because no action was taken in committee<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1323/all-actions|title=Actions - H.R.1323 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Reducing Information Control Designations Act|first=Driehaus|last=Steve|date=March 18, 2009|website=www.congress.gov|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and bills expire at the end of every Congress, there is currently no bill to solve unclassified designations.\n\n===Restricted===\nDuring and before [[World War II]], the U.S. had a category of classified information called Restricted, which was below confidential. The U.S. no longer has a Restricted classification, but many other nations and [[NATO]] do. The U.S. treats Restricted information it receives from other governments as Confidential. The U.S. does use the term ''restricted data'' in a completely different way to refer to [[nuclear secret]]s, as described above.\n\n===Classified classifications===\nExecutive Order 13526, which forms the legal basis for the U.S. classification system, states that \"information may be classified at one of the following three levels\", with Top Secret as the highest level ([[s:Executive Order 13526#Sec. 1.2|Sec. 1.2]]). However, this executive order provides for [[special access program]]s that further restricted access to a small number of individuals and permit additional security measures ([[s:Executive Order 13526#Sec. 4.3|Sec. 4.3]]). These practices can be compared with (and may have inspired) the concepts [[multilevel security]] and [[role-based access control]]. U.S. law also has special provisions protecting information related to [[cryptography]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/798.html 18 USC 798]), nuclear weapons and atomic energy (''see'' [[#Controls on atomic-energy information|Controls on atomic-energy information]]) and the identity of covert intelligence agents (''see'' [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]]).\n\n==Proper procedure for classifying U.S. government documents==\nTo be properly classified, a classification authority (an individual charged by the U.S. government with the right and responsibility to properly determine the level of classification and the reason for classification) must determine the appropriate classification level, as well as the reason information is to be classified. A determination must be made as to how and when the document will be declassified, and the document marked accordingly. Executive Order 13526 describes the reasons and requirements for information to be classified and declassified ([[s:Executive Order 13526#Part 1|Part 1]]). Individual agencies within the government develop guidelines for what information is classified and at what level.\n\nThe former decision is original classification. A great majority of classified documents are created by derivative classification. For example, if one piece of information, taken from a secret document, is put into a document along with 100 pages of unclassified information, the document, as a whole, will be secret. Proper rules stipulate that every paragraph will bear a classification marking of (U) for Unclassified, (C) for Confidential, (S) for Secret, and (TS) for Top Secret. Therefore, in this example, only one paragraph will have the (S) marking. If the page containing that paragraph is double-sided, the page should be marked SECRET on top and bottom of both sides.<ref name=\"5FAH-3H700EO12958\">{{cite web| url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/05FAH03/05FAH030710.html| title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Handbook Volume 5 Handbook 3 - TAGS/Terms Handbook: 5 FAH-3 H-700 E.O. 12958, AS AMENDED, TELEGRAM CLASSIFICATION MARKING | publisher = U.S. Department of State | date= 14 July 2009 | accessdate= January 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA review of classification policies by the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] aimed at developing a uniform classification policy and a single classification guide that could be used by the entire [[U.S. intelligence community]] found significant interagency differences that impaired cooperation and performance.

The U.S. government specifies in some detail the procedures for protecting classified information. The rooms or buildings for holding and handling classified material must have a facility clearance at the same level as the most sensitive material to be handled. Good quality commercial [[physical security]] standards generally suffice for lower levels of classification; at the highest levels, people sometimes must work in rooms designed like [[bank vault]]s (''see'' [[Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility]] \u2013 SCIF). The [[U.S. Congress]] has such facilities inside the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], among other Congressional handling procedures for protecting confidentiality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RS20748.pdf |title=Protection of Classified Information by Congress: Practices and Proposals |last=Kaiser |first=Frederick M. |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2008-06-22}}</ref> The U.S. [[General Services Administration]] sets standards for locks and containers used to store classified material. The most commonly-approved security containers resemble heavy-duty [[file cabinet]]s with a [[combination lock]] in the middle of one drawer. In response to advances in methods to defeat mechanical combination locks, the U.S. government switched to electromechanical locks that limit the rate of attempts to unlock them. After a specific number of failed attempts, they will permanently lock, requiring a locksmith to reset them.\n\nClassified U.S. government documents typically must be stamped with their classification on the cover and at the top and bottom of each page. Authors must mark each paragraph, title and caption in a document with the highest level of information it contains, usually by placing appropriate initials in parentheses at the beginning of the paragraph, title, or caption. Commonly, one must affix a brightly colored cover sheet to the cover of each classified document to prevent unauthorized observation of classified material ([[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]]) and to remind users to lock up unattended documents. The most sensitive material requires [[Two-man rule|two-person integrity]], where two cleared individuals are responsible for the material at all times. Approved containers for such material have two separate combination locks, both of which must be opened to access the contents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nRestrictions dictate shipment methods for classified documents. Top Secret material must go by special courier; Secret material within the U.S. via [[registered mail]]; and, Confidential material by [[Certified Mail|certified mail]]. Electronic transmission of classified information largely requires the use of National Security Agency approved/certified [[Type 1 product|\"Type 1\"]] cryptosystems using NSA's unpublished and classified [[NSA Suite A Cryptography|Suite A]] algorithms. The classification of the Suite A algorithms categorizes the hardware that store them as a [[Controlled Cryptographic Item]] (CCI) under the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]], or ITAR. CCI equipment and keying material must be controlled and stored with heightened physical security, even when the device is not processing classified information or contains no cryptographic key. NSA is currently implementing what it's calling [[Suite B]] which is a group of commercial algorithms such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), [[Secure Hash Algorithm (disambiguation)|Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)]], [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] (ECDSA) and [[Elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (ECDH). Suite B provides protection for data up to Top Secret on non-CCI devices, which is especially useful in high risk environments or operations needed to prevent Suite A compromise. These less stringent hardware requirements stem from the device not having to \"protect\" classified Suite A algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/ |title=NSA Suite B Cryptography \u2013 NSA/CSS |publisher=Nsa.gov |accessdate=2013-07-04}}</ref>\n\nSpecialized computer [[operating system]]s known as [[trusted operating system]]s are available for processing classified information. These systems enforce the classification and labeling rules described above in software. Since 2005, however, they are not considered secure enough to allow uncleared users to share computers with classified activities. Thus, if one creates an unclassified document on a secret device, the resultant data is classified secret until it can be manually reviewed. Computer networks for sharing classified information are segregated by the highest sensitivity level they are allowed to transmit, for example, [[SIPRNet]] (Secret) and [[JWICS]] (Top Secret-SCI).\n\nThe destruction of certain types of classified documents requires burning, [[paper shredder|shredding]], pulping or pulverizing using approved procedures and must be witnessed and logged.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Classified computer data presents special problems. ''See'' [[Data remanence]].\n\n===Lifetime commitment===\nWhen a cleared individual leaves the job or employer for which they were granted access to classified information, they are formally debriefed from the program. [[Debriefing]] is an administrative process that accomplishes two main goals: it creates a formal record that the individual no longer has access to the classified information for that program; and it reminds the individual of their lifetime commitment to protect that information. Typically, the individual is asked to sign another [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA), similar to that which they signed when initially briefed, and this document serves as the formal record. The debriefed individual does not lose their [[security clearance]]; they have only surrendered the need to know for information related to that particular job.\n\n==Classifications and clearances between U.S. government agencies==\n\n[[File:Goldwater casey nyt leak.png|right|thumb|250px|Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] reprimanding CIA director [[William J. Casey]] for Secret info showing up in ''[[The New York Times]]'', but then saying it was over-classified to begin with. 1983]]\n\nIn the past, clearances did not necessarily transfer between various U.S. government agencies. For example, an individual cleared for Department of Defense Top Secret had to undergo another investigation before being granted a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] [[Q clearance]]. Agencies are now supposed to honor background investigations by other agencies if they are still current. Because most security clearances only apply inside the agency where the holder works, if one needs to meet with another agency to discuss classified matters, it is possible and necessary to pass one's clearance to the other agency. For example, officials visiting at the White House from other government agencies would pass their clearances to the Executive Office of the President (EOP).\n\nThe Department of Energy security clearance required to access Top Secret Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, and National Security Information, as well as Secret Restricted Data, is a [[Q clearance]]. The lower-level [[L clearance]] is sufficient for access to Secret Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information, as well as Confidential Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.<ref>Los Alamos National Laboratory, [http://www.lanl.gov/security/clearances/index.shtml Clearance Processing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011093349/http://www.lanl.gov/security/clearances/index.shtml |date=October 11, 2006 }}. Retrieved December 15, 2006.</ref> In practice, access to Restricted Data is granted, on a need-to-know basis, to personnel with appropriate clearances. At one time, a person might hold both a TS and a Q clearance, but that duplication and cost is no longer required. For all practical purposes, Q is equivalent to Top Secret, and L is equivalent to Secret.\n\nContrary to popular lore, the [[Yankee White]] clearance given to personnel who work directly with the President is not a classification. Individuals having Yankee White clearances undergo extensive background investigations. The criteria include U.S. citizenship, unquestionable loyalty, and an absolute absence of any foreign influence over the individual, his family, or \"persons to whom the individual is closely linked\".<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/nuclear-football.htm The Football], GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref name=\"dtic.mil-5210.87\">[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/521087p.pdf Selection of DoD Military and Civilian Personnel and Contractor Employees for Assignment to Presidential Support Activities (PSAs)], Department of Defense Instruction No. 5210.87 (November 30, 1998).</ref> Also, they must not have traveled (save while in government employ and at the instructions of the United States) to countries that are considered to be unfriendly to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Yankee White cleared personnel are granted access to any information for which they have a need to know, regardless of which organization classified it or at what level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSee also the Single Scope Background Investigation below, along with explicit compartmented access indoctrination. Some compartments, especially intelligence-related, may require a [[polygraph]] examination, although the reliability of the polygraph is controversial. The NSA uses the polygraph early in the clearance process{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} while the CIA uses it at the end, which may suggest divergent opinions on the proper use of the polygraph.\n\n==Categories that are not classifications==\n[[compartmentalization (information security)|Compartments]] also exist, that employ [[code name|code words]] pertaining to specific projects and are used to more easily manage individual access requirements. Code words are not levels of classification themselves, but a person working on a project may have the code word for that project added to his file, and then will be given access to the relevant documents. Code words may also label the sources of various documents; for example, code words are used to indicate that a document may break the cover of intelligence operatives if its content becomes known. The [[World War II|WWII]] code word ''[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]'' identified information found by decrypting German ciphers, such as the [[Enigma machine]], and which\u2014regardless of its own significance\u2014might inform the Germans that Enigma was broken if they became aware that it was known.\n\n===Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP)===\nThe terms \"[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]]\" (SCI)<ref>{{cite web\n  | author = Director of Central Intelligence\n  | title = Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/7: Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information\n  | date=June 1998\n  | url = https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/dcid1-7.html\n  | id = sci\n  | accessdate = September 30, 2007| author-link = Director of Central Intelligence\n }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510521m_vol3.pdf|title=Directives Division|author=|date=|website=www.dtic.mil|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and \"[[Special Access Program]]\" (SAP)<ref>{{cite web\n  | author = United States Department of Defense\n  | title = Department of Defense Overprint to the National Industrial Security Program\n  | date=February 1995\n  | url = https://fas.org/sgp/library/nispom_dod_overprint.pdf\n  | id = nispom\n  }}</ref> are widely misunderstood as classification levels or specific clearances.\n\nIn fact, the terms refer to methods of handling certain types of classified information that relate to specific national-security topics or programs (whose existence may not be publicly acknowledged) or the sensitive nature of which requires special handling, and thereby those accessing it require special approval to access it.\n\nThe paradigms for these two categories, SCI originating in the intelligence community and SAP in the Department of Defense, formalize 'Need to Know' and addresses two key logistical issues encountered in the day-to-day control of classified information:\n\n:* Individuals with a legitimate need to know may not be able to function effectively without knowing certain facts about their work. However, granting all such individuals a blanket DoD clearance (often known as a \"collateral\" clearance) at the Top Secret level would be undesirable, not to mention prohibitively expensive.\n\n:* The government may wish to limit certain types of sensitive information only to those who work directly on related programs, regardless of the collateral clearance they hold. Thus, even someone with a Top Secret clearance cannot gain access to its Confidential information unless it is specifically granted.\n\nTo be clear, \"collateral\" simply means one lacks special access (e.g. SCI, SAP, COMSEC, NATO, etc.). Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret are all, by themselves, collateral clearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs|title=Security Clearance FAQs - ClearedJobs.Net|author=|date=|website=clearedjobs.net|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nSAP and SCI are usually found at the Top Secret classification, but there is no prohibition of applying such segregation to Confidential and Secret information.<ref>http://www.nicoe.capmed.mil/About%20Us/Shared%20Documents/security_clearance_faq.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/536733|title=GSA Clearance Verification-Passing Procedures|author=|date=|website=www.gsa.gov|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSAP and SCI implementation are roughly equivalent, and it is reasonable to discuss their implementation as one topic. For example, SAP material needs to be stored and used in a facility much like the SCIF described below.\n\nDepartment of Energy information, especially the more sensitive SIGMA categories, may be treated as SAP or SCI.\n\n====Access to compartmented information====\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2008}}\nPersonnel who require knowledge of SCI or SAP information fall into two general categories:\n* Persons with a need to know\n* Persons with actual access\n\nAccess to classified information is not authorized based on clearance status. Access is only permitted to individuals after determining they have a need to know. Need-to-know is a determination that an individual requires access to specific classified information in the performance of (or assist in the performance of) lawful and authorized government functions and duties.\n\nTo achieve selective separation of program information while still allowing full access to those working on the program, a separate compartment, identified by a unique codeword, is created for the information. This entails establishing communication channels, data storage, and work locations (SCIF\u2014[[Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility]]), which are physically and logically separated not only from the unclassified world, but from general Department of Defense classified channels as well.\n\nThus established, all information generated within the compartment is classified according to the general rules above. However, to emphasize that the information is compartmented, all documents are marked with both the classification level and the codeword (and the caveat \"Handle via <compartment name> Channels Only\", or \"Handle via <compartment names> Jointly\" if the document contains material from multiple programs).\n\n[[File:BYEMAN Coversheet.jpg|thumb|right|Cover sheet for information protected by the [[Byeman Control System|BYEMAN control system]]]]\nExamples of such SCI control systems are:<ref>Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-us-classification-system.html The US Classification System]</ref>\n* COMINT or Special Intelligence (SI)\n* ENDSEAL (EL)\n* TALENT KEYHOLE (TK)\n* HUMINT Control System (HCS)\n* KLONDIKE (KDK)\n* RESERVE (RSV)\n* [[BYEMAN]] (BYE or B)\n\nThe COMINT control system is for sensitive [[signals intelligence]] information and contains several compartments, like:\n* Very Restricted Knowledge (VRK)\n* Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI), which is used by NSA and restricted to very few people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/nsa-surveillance-revelations-encryption-expert-chat | title=Explaining the latest NSA revelations \u2013 Q&A with internet privacy experts | publisher=The Guardian newspaper | date=September 6, 2013 | author=Ball, James | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>\n* GAMMA\n\nA person is granted access to a specific compartment after the individual has: (a) had a [[Single Scope Background Investigation]] similar to that required for a collateral Top Secret clearance; (b) been \"read into\" or briefed on the nature and sensitivity of the compartment; and (c) signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA).\n\nThe individual then has access to all information in the compartment, regardless of its classification (and assuming a need to know). However, access does not extend to any other compartment; i.e., there is no single \"SCI clearance\" analogous to DoD collateral Top Secret. The requirements for DCID 6/4 eligibility (a determination that an individual is eligible for access to SCI), subsumes the requirements for a TS collateral clearance. Being granted DCID 6/4 eligibility includes the simultaneous granting of a TS collateral clearance, as adjudicators are required to adjudicate to the highest level that the investigation (SSBI) supports.\n\n====Groups of compartmented information====\n{{Page numbers needed|section|date=September 2008}}\nSAPs in the Department of Defense are subdivided into three further groups, as defined in {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|10|119}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/nispom.htm |title=National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThere is no public reference to whether SCI is divided in the same manner, but news reports reflecting that only the [[Gang of Eight (intelligence)|Gang of Eight]] members of Congress are briefed on certain intelligence activities, it may be assumed that similar rules apply for SCI or for programs with overlapping SAP and SCI content.\n\nThe groups for Department of Defense SAPs are:\n\n:* '''Acknowledged''': appears as a line item as \"classified project\" or the equivalent in the federal budget, although details of its content are not revealed. The budget element will associate the SAP with a Department of Defense component organization, such as a Military Department (e.g. [[Department of the Navy]]), a Combatant Command (e.g. [[U.S. Special Operations Command]]) or a Defense Agency (e.g. [[Defense Information Systems Agency]].)\n:* '''Unacknowledged''': no reference to such SAPs is found in the publicly published federal budget; its funding is hidden in a classified annex, often called the \"black budget\". The Congressional defense committees, however, are briefed on the specifics of such SAPs.\n:* '''Waived''': At the sole discretion of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], on a case-by-case basis in the interest of national security, there is no mention in the budget at all, and only the \"Big 6\" members of Congress; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the armed services committees, the appropriations committees and the defense appropriations subcommittees; receive notification of such SAPs.\n\nExamples of SCI topics are human intelligence, communications intelligence, and intelligence collected by satellites. One or more compartments may be created for each area, and each of these compartments may contain multiple subcompartments (e.g., a specific HUMINT operation), themselves with their own code names.\n\nSpecific compartmented programs will have their own specific rules. For example, it is standard that no person is allowed unaccompanied access to a nuclear weapon or to command-and-control systems for nuclear weapons. Personnel with nuclear-weapons access are under the [[Personnel Reliability Program]].\n\nSome highly sensitive SAP or SCI programs may also use the \"no lone zone\" method (that is, a physical location into which no one is allowed to enter unaccompanied) described for nuclear weapons.\n\n===Handling caveats===\nThe United States also has a system of restrictive [[:wikt:caveat|caveats]] that can be added to a document: these are constantly changing, but can include (in abbreviated form) a requirement that the document not be shared with a civilian contractor or not leave a specific room. These restrictions are not classifications in and of themselves; rather, they restrict the dissemination of information within those who have the appropriate clearance level and possibly the need to know the information. Remarks such as \"EYES ONLY\" and \"DO NOT COPY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf|title=Memorandum of July 25, 2019, telephone conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\" also limit the restriction. One violating these directives might be guilty of violating a lawful order or mishandling classified information.\n\nFor ease of use, caveats and abbreviations have been adopted that can be included in the summary classification marking (header/footer) to enable the restrictions to be identified at a glance.

Such information is \"[[born secret|classified from birth]]\", unlike all other sensitive information, which must be classified by some authorized individual. However, authorized classifiers still must determine whether documents or material are classified or restricted.\n\nThe [[U.S. Department of Energy]] recognizes two types of Restricted Data:<ref>Los Alamos National Laboratory, [http://www.hr.lanl.gov/SCourses/All/PortionMarking/define.htm ''Guide to Portion Marking Documents and Material'', Appendix B, Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011093350/http://www.hr.lanl.gov/SCourses/All/PortionMarking/define.htm |date=October 11, 2006 }}. Retrieved December 15, 2006.</ref>\n* '''Restricted Data.''' Data concerning the design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy.\n* '''Formerly Restricted Data.''' Classified information jointly determined by the DOE and the Department of Defense to be related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and removed from the Restricted Data category.\n\nDocuments containing such information must be marked \"RESTRICTED DATA\" (RD) or \"FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA\" (FRD) in addition to any other classification marking. Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are further categorized as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential.\n\n====SIGMA categories and Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information====\nRESTRICTED DATA contains further compartments. The Department of Energy establishes a list of SIGMA Categories<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = [no title, apparent extract from University of California laboratory security briefing]\n  | publisher = University of California\n  | date = n.d.\n  | url = http://labs.ucop.edu/internet/security/brief04/docs/sigmas.pdf\n  | id = sigmas\n  | accessdate = 2007-09-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908141749/http://labs.ucop.edu/internet/security/brief04/docs/sigmas.pdf |archivedate = 2006-09-08}}</ref> for more fine-grained control than RESTRICTED DATA.\n[[Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information]] (CNWDI, colloquially pronounced ''\"Sin-Widdy\"'') reveals the theory of operation or design of the components of a nuclear weapon. As such, it would be SIGMA 1 or SIGMA 2 material, assuming [[laser fusion]] is not involved in the information.\n\nAccess to CNWDI is supposed to be kept to the minimum number of individuals needed. In written documents, paragraphs containing the material, assuming it is Top Secret, would be marked (TS//RD-CNWDI). SIGMA information of special sensitivity may be handled much like SAP or SCI material (q.v.)\n\n====Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information====\nWhile most [[Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information]] is sensitive, it may or may not be classified. The desired power densities of naval reactors make their design peculiar to military use, specifically high-displacement, high-speed vessels. The proliferation of quieter- or higher-performance marine propulsion systems presents a national-security threat to the United States. Due to this fact, all but the most basic information concerning NNPI is classified. The [[United States Navy]] recognizes that the public has an interest in environmental, safety, and health information, and that the basic research the Navy carries out can be useful to industry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n==Sharing of classified information with other countries==\nIn cases where the United States wishes to share classified information bilaterally (or multilaterally) with a country that has a sharing agreement, the information is marked with \"REL TO USA\", (release) and the three-letter country code.<ref>See the WATERWITCH document at right for an example of a document marked REL TO USA, FVEY</ref> For example, if the U.S. wanted to release classified information to the government of [[Canada]], it would mark the document \"REL TO USA, CAN\".

Their article was entitled \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\". In it, they point out that Espionage law '''does not criminalize classified information''', only '''national defense''' information. They point out that Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to make the disclosing of classified information illegal, in and of itself. Instead, Congress has strictly limited which sort of classified information is illegal, and under which specific circumstances it is illegal. i.e. in {{uscsub|18|798}} Congress specifically criminalized leaking cryptographic information that is classified, but when it passed the law it specifically stated the law didn't criminalize disclosing other types of classified information.<ref name=edgsch>The Edgar & Schmidt 1973 ''Columbia Law Review'', \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\".

They suggest such a classification is intended to apply to information relating to things whose possible existence is to be denied, such as aliens, as opposed to things whose potential existence may be recognized, but for which access to information regarding specific programs would be denied as classified. The British government, for example, denied for several decades that they were either involved or interested in UFO sightings. However, in 2008, the government revealed they have monitored UFO activity for at least the past 30 years.<ref>{{cite web \n |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/\n |title=UFOs - The National Archives \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009043543/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/\n |archivedate=October 9, 2018 \n }}</ref> The existence of an \"Above Top Secret\" classification is considered by some as unnecessary to keep the existence of aliens a secret, as they say information at the Top Secret level, or any level for that matter, can be restricted on the basis of [[need to know]]. Thus, the U.S. government could conceal an alien project without having to resort to another level of clearance, as need to know would limit the ability to have access to the information. Some suggest that claims of the existence of such a classification level may be based on the unsubstantiated belief that the levels of classification are themselves classified. As such, they feel that books claiming to contain \"Above Top Secret\" information on UFOs or [[remote viewing]] should arguably be taken with a [[grain of salt]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.topsecretwriters.com/2009/11/above-top-secret/\n|title=Above Top Secret\n|first=Ryan\n|last=Dube\n|publisher=Top Secret Writers\n|date=November 2009}}</ref>\n\nWithout making a judgment on if such classifications have been used for space aliens, it is a reality that even the names of some compartments were classified, and certainly the meaning of the code names.

BYEMAN, the main NRO compartment, was classified as a full word, although the special security offices could refer, in an unclassified way, to \"B policy\".\n\n==Responsible agencies==\n\nAny agency designated by the President can originate classified information if it meets the content criteria; each agency is responsible for safeguarding and declassifying its own documents. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) has custody of classified documents from defunct agencies, and also houses the National Declassification Center (since 2010) and [[Information Security Oversight Office]]. The [[Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel]] has representatives from the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice; the National Archives, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; the National Security Advisor; the Central Intelligence Agency; and Information Security Oversight Office.<ref>[[Executive Order 13526]], Sec. 5.3.</ref>\n\n==Declassification==\n\n[[Declassification]] is the process of removing the classification of a document and opening it for public inspection.\n\n===Automatic declassification===\nIn accordance with [[Executive Order 13526]], published January 5, 2010 (which superseded [[Executive Order 12958]], as amended), an executive agency must declassify its documents after 25 years unless they fall under one of the nine narrow exemptions outlined by section 3.3 of the order. Classified documents 25 years or older must be reviewed by any and all agencies that possess an interest in the sensitive information found in the document. Documents classified for longer than 50 years must concern human intelligence sources or weapons of mass destruction, or get special permission.<ref>[[Executive Order 12958]], Section 3.3 (h)</ref> All documents older than 75 years must have special permission.<ref>[[Executive Order 12958]], Section 3.3 (h)(3)</ref>\n\n===Systematic declassification===\nThe Order also requires that agencies establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review, based on the new and narrower criteria. This only applies to records that are of permanent historical value and less than 25 years old. Section 3.4 of Order 13526, directs agencies to prioritize the systematic review of records based upon the degree of researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review.\n\n=== Mandatory Declassification Review ===\nA Mandatory Declassification Review, or MDR, is requested by an individual in an attempt to declassify a document for release to the public. These challenges are presented to the agency whose equity, or \"ownership\", is invested in the document. Once an MDR request has been submitted to an agency for the review of a particular document, the agency must respond either with an approval, a denial, or the inability to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of the requested document. After the initial request, an appeal can be filed with the agency by the requester. If the agency refuses to declassify that document, then a decision from a higher authority can be provided by the appellate panel, the [[Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel]] (ISCAP).\n\n===Freedom of Information Act===\n\nThe U.S. [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on July 4, 1966, took effect the following year, and was amended in 1974, 1976, 1986, 1996 and 2002 (in 1974 over President Ford's veto). This act allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the U.S. government. Any member of the public may ask for a classified document to be declassified and made available for any reason. The requestor is required to specify with reasonable certainty the documents of interest. If the agency refuses to declassify, the decision can be taken to the courts for a review. The FOIA does not guarantee that requested documents will be released; refusals usually fall under one of the nine of the declassification exemptions that protect highly sensitive information.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===History of National Archives and Records Administration role===\n\nAfter declassification, the documents from many agencies are accessioned at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] and put on the open shelves for the public. NARA also reviews documents for declassification.\n\nNARA first established a formal declassification program for records in 1972, and between 1973 and 1996 reviewed nearly 650 million pages of historically valuable federal records related to World War II, the Korean War, and American foreign policy in the 1950s as part of its systematic declassification review program. From 1996 to 2006, NARA had processed and released close to 460 million pages of federal records, working in partnership with the agencies that originated the records. Over the years, NARA has processed more than 1.1 billion pages of national security classified federal records, resulting in the declassification and release of ninety-one percent of the records.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nNARA has also provided significant support to several special projects to review and release federal records on topics of extraordinary public interest such as [[Prisoner of war|POW]]/[[Missing in action|MIAs]] or [[Nazi war crime]]s. Additionally, NARA works closely with reference archivists to ensure that the federal records most in demand by researchers receive priority for declassification review and performs review on demand for individuals who need records that do not fall into a priority category. NARA has improved or developed electronic systems to support declassification, automating some processes and thus ensuring a more complete record of declassification actions. With assistance from the Air Force, NARA established{{when|date=March 2013}} the Interagency Referral Center (IRC) in order to support agencies as they seek access to their equities in federal records at the National Archives at College Park and to ensure that high-demand records are processed first.\n\nIn 2009, [[Executive Order 13526]] created the [[National Declassification Center]] at NARA, which also houses the [[Information Security Oversight Office]].\n\n==== Presidential libraries ====\n\n[[Presidential libraries]] hold in excess of 30 million classified pages, including approximately 8 million pages from the administrations of Presidents Hoover through Carter, that were subject to automatic declassification on December 31, 2006. The foreign policy materials in Presidential collections are among the highest-level foreign policy documents in the Federal government and are of significant historical value.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2006, the national [[Presidential Library]] system reviewed, declassified, and released 1,603,429 pages of presidential materials using systematic guidelines delegated to the Archivist of the United States. NARA has also hosted on-site agency review teams at the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Ford Presidential Libraries to manage classified equities and all presidential libraries have robust mandatory declassification review programs to support requests of individual researchers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Controlled Cryptographic Item]]\n* [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]]\n* [[Espionage Act of 1917]]\n* [[FAA 1600.2]]\n* [[Invention Secrecy Act]]\n* [[List of U.S. security clearance terms]]\n* [[McCollum memo]]\n* ''[[Secrecy News]]'', a newsletter that covers U.S. classification policy\n* ''[[United States v.

Sensitivity is based upon a calculation of the damage to national security that the release of the information would cause. The United States has three levels of classification: Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Each level of classification indicates an increasing degree of sensitivity. Thus, if one holds a Top Secret [[security clearance]], one is allowed to handle information up to the level of Top Secret, including Secret and Confidential information. If one holds a Secret clearance, one may not then handle Top Secret information, but may handle Secret and Confidential classified information.\n\nThe United States does not have a British-style [[Official Secrets Act]]; instead, several laws protect classified information, including the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] and the [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]] of 1982. \nA 2013 report to Congress noted that the relevant laws have been mostly used to prosecute foreign agents, or those passing classified information to them, and that leaks to the press have rarely been prosecuted.<ref name=elsea/> The legislative and executive branches of government, including US presidents, have frequently leaked classified information to journalists.<ref>Stansfield Turner, ''Burn Before Reading'', 2006</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref>The Deadly Bet, Walter LaFaber</ref><ref>Seeds of Terror, Gretchen Peters</ref><ref>[http://stephenkim.org/2011/09/03/classified-information-in-woodwards-obamas-wars/ Classified Information in \"Obama's Wars\"], September 29, 2010, Jack Goldsmith, Lawfare, via stephenkim.org</ref> Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to pass a law that generally outlaws disclosing classified information.

Examples include information on [[Augusto Pinochet]] to the government of [[Chile]]. In October 2015, US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] provided [[Michelle Bachelet]], Chile's president, with a [[USB flash drive|pen drive]] containing hundreds of newly declassified documents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21707587-united-states-tries-win-friends-revealing-past-misdeeds-sunlight-diplomacy|title=Sunlight diplomacy|date=2016-09-24|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|accessdate=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) 2011 Annual Report to the President.pdf|thumb|page=12|Derivative classification activity 1996\u20132011]]\nIn the U.S., information is called \"classified\" if it has been assigned one of the three levels: Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Information that is not so labeled is called \"Unclassified information\". The term ''declassified'' is used for information that has had its classification removed, and ''downgraded'' refers to information that has been assigned a lower classification level but is still classified. Many documents are automatically downgraded and then declassified after some number of years.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The U.S. government uses the terms ''[[Sensitive but unclassified|Sensitive But Unclassified]]'' (SBU), ''[[Sensitive Security Information]]'' (SSI), ''Critical Program Information'' (CPI), ''For Official Use Only'' (FOUO), or ''Law Enforcement Sensitive'' (LES) to refer to information that is not Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret, but whose dissemination is still restricted. Reasons for such restrictions can include [[Wassenaar Arrangement|export controls]], [[privacy]] regulations, court orders, and ongoing criminal investigations, as well as national security. Information that was never classified is sometimes referred to as \"open source\" by those who work in classified activities. ''Public Safety Sensitive'' (PSS) refers to information that is similar to Law Enforcement Sensitive but could be shared between the various public safety disciplines (Law Enforcement, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services).

Having Top Secret clearance does not allow one to view all Top Secret documents. The user of the information must possess the clearance necessary for the sensitivity of the information, as well as a [[need to know|legitimate need]] to obtain the information. For example, all US military pilots are required to obtain at least a Secret clearance, but they may only access documents directly related to their orders. Secret information might have additional access controls that could prevent someone with a Top Secret clearance from seeing it.{{citation needed lead|date=October 2014}}\n\nSince all federal departments are part of the Executive Branch, the classification system is governed by Executive Order rather than by law. Typically each president will issue a new executive order, either tightening classification or loosening it. The Clinton administration made a major change in the classification system by issuing an executive order that for the first time required all classified documents to be declassified after 25 years unless they were reviewed by the agency that created the information and determined to require continuing classification.<ref>EXECUTIVE ORDER 12958 https://fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12958.html</ref>\n\n===Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data===\n\nRestricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are classification markings that concern nuclear information. These are the only two classifications that are established by federal law, being defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Nuclear information is not automatically declassified after 25 years. Documents with nuclear information covered under the Atomic Energy Act will be marked with a classification level (confidential, secret or top secret) and a restricted data or formerly restricted data marking. Nuclear information as specified in the act may inadvertently appear in unclassified documents and must be reclassified when discovered. Even documents created by private individuals have been seized for containing nuclear information and classified. Only the Department of Energy may declassify nuclear information.<ref>CLASSIFICATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS-RELATED INFORMATION, http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/hss/Classification/docs/CTI-Training-RD-FRD-Briefing.pdf</ref>\n\n===Code Word classifications===\nTop Secret is the highest level of classification. However some information is compartmentalized by adding a code word so that only those who have been cleared for each code word can see it. This information is also known as \"[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]]\" (SCI). A document marked SECRET (CODE WORD) could be viewed only by a person with a secret or top secret clearance and that specific code word clearance. Each code word deals with a different kind of information. The CIA administers code word clearances.<ref>\nIRoss Anderson. \"Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, First Edition, Chapter 8.2: Compartmentation, the Chinese Wall, and the BMA Model\" www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-08.pdf</ref>\n\n===Top Secret===\n[[Image:NSALibertyReport.p13.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a U.S. classified document; page 13 of a [[United States]] [[National Security Agency]] report<ref>William D.

This information is supposed to be released only to law enforcement agencies (sheriff, police, etc.), but, because the information is unclassified, it is sometimes released to the public as well. Information that is unclassified but which the government does not believe should be subject to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests is often classified as <nowiki>U//FOUO</nowiki>\u2014\"Unclassified\u2014For Official Use Only\". In addition to FOUO information, information can be categorized according to its availability to be distributed (e.g., Distribution D may only be released to approved Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Defense contractor personnel<ref>U.S. Department of Defense Directive DoDD 5230.24, March 18, 1987</ref>). Also, the statement of NOFORN (meaning \"no [[foreign national]]s\") is applied to any information that may not be released to any non-U.S. citizen. NOFORN and distribution statements are often used in conjunction with classified information or alone on SBU information. Documents subject to export controls have a specific warning to that effect. Information which is \"personally identifiable\" is governed by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]] and is also subject to strict controls regardless of its level of classification.\n\nFinally, information at one level of classification may be \"upgraded by aggregation\" to a higher level. For example, a specific technical capability of a weapons system might be classified Secret, but the aggregation of all technical capabilities of the system into a single document could be deemed Top Secret.\n\nUse of information restrictions outside the classification system is growing in the U.S. government. In September 2005 J. William Leonard, director of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|U.S. National Archives]] [[Information Security Oversight Office]], was quoted in the press as saying, \"No one individual in government can identify all the controlled, unclassified [categories], let alone describe their rules.\"<ref>Michael J.

The CUI categories and subcategories were hoped to serve as the exclusive designations for identifying unclassified information throughout the executive branch not covered by [[Executive Order 12958]] or the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]] (as amended) but still required safeguarding or dissemination controls, pursuant to and consistent with any applicable laws, regulations, and government-wide policies in place at the time.

The U.S. no longer has a Restricted classification, but many other nations and [[NATO]] do. The U.S. treats Restricted information it receives from other governments as Confidential. The U.S. does use the term ''restricted data'' in a completely different way to refer to [[nuclear secret]]s, as described above.\n\n===Classified classifications===\nExecutive Order 13526, which forms the legal basis for the U.S. classification system, states that \"information may be classified at one of the following three levels\", with Top Secret as the highest level ([[s:Executive Order 13526#Sec. 1.2|Sec. 1.2]]). However, this executive order provides for [[special access program]]s that further restricted access to a small number of individuals and permit additional security measures ([[s:Executive Order 13526#Sec. 4.3|Sec. 4.3]]). These practices can be compared with (and may have inspired) the concepts [[multilevel security]] and [[role-based access control]]. U.S. law also has special provisions protecting information related to [[cryptography]] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/798.html 18 USC 798]), nuclear weapons and atomic energy (''see'' [[#Controls on atomic-energy information|Controls on atomic-energy information]]) and the identity of covert intelligence agents (''see'' [[Intelligence Identities Protection Act]]).\n\n==Proper procedure for classifying U.S. government documents==\nTo be properly classified, a classification authority (an individual charged by the U.S. government with the right and responsibility to properly determine the level of classification and the reason for classification) must determine the appropriate classification level, as well as the reason information is to be classified. A determination must be made as to how and when the document will be declassified, and the document marked accordingly. Executive Order 13526 describes the reasons and requirements for information to be classified and declassified ([[s:Executive Order 13526#Part 1|Part 1]]). Individual agencies within the government develop guidelines for what information is classified and at what level.\n\nThe former decision is original classification. A great majority of classified documents are created by derivative classification. For example, if one piece of information, taken from a secret document, is put into a document along with 100 pages of unclassified information, the document, as a whole, will be secret. Proper rules stipulate that every paragraph will bear a classification marking of (U) for Unclassified, (C) for Confidential, (S) for Secret, and (TS) for Top Secret. Therefore, in this example, only one paragraph will have the (S) marking. If the page containing that paragraph is double-sided, the page should be marked SECRET on top and bottom of both sides.<ref name=\"5FAH-3H700EO12958\">{{cite web| url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/05FAH03/05FAH030710.html| title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Handbook Volume 5 Handbook 3 - TAGS/Terms Handbook: 5 FAH-3 H-700 E.O. 12958, AS AMENDED, TELEGRAM CLASSIFICATION MARKING | publisher = U.S. Department of State | date= 14 July 2009 | accessdate= January 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA review of classification policies by the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] aimed at developing a uniform classification policy and a single classification guide that could be used by the entire [[U.S. intelligence community]] found significant interagency differences that impaired cooperation and performance.

Many interpretations exist concerning what constitutes harm or the degree of harm that might result from improper disclosure of the information, often leading to inconsistent or contradictory guidelines from different agencies. ... There appears to be no common understanding of classification levels among the classification guides reviewed by the team, nor any consistent guidance as to what constitutes 'damage,' 'serious damage,' or 'exceptionally grave damage' to national security. ...

Current policy requires that the classifier be \"able\" to describe the basis for classification but not that he or she in fact do so.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/intel/class.pdf\n|title=Intelligence Community Classification Guidance: Findings and Recommendations Report\n|publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence\n|date=January 2008\n|accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===Classification categories===\nStep 3 in the classification process is to assign a reason for the classification.

The U.S. government specifies in some detail the procedures for protecting classified information. The rooms or buildings for holding and handling classified material must have a facility clearance at the same level as the most sensitive material to be handled. Good quality commercial [[physical security]] standards generally suffice for lower levels of classification; at the highest levels, people sometimes must work in rooms designed like [[bank vault]]s (''see'' [[Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility]] \u2013 SCIF). The [[U.S. Congress]] has such facilities inside the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], among other Congressional handling procedures for protecting confidentiality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RS20748.pdf |title=Protection of Classified Information by Congress: Practices and Proposals |last=Kaiser |first=Frederick M. |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2008-06-22}}</ref> The U.S. [[General Services Administration]] sets standards for locks and containers used to store classified material. The most commonly-approved security containers resemble heavy-duty [[file cabinet]]s with a [[combination lock]] in the middle of one drawer. In response to advances in methods to defeat mechanical combination locks, the U.S. government switched to electromechanical locks that limit the rate of attempts to unlock them. After a specific number of failed attempts, they will permanently lock, requiring a locksmith to reset them.\n\nClassified U.S. government documents typically must be stamped with their classification on the cover and at the top and bottom of each page. Authors must mark each paragraph, title and caption in a document with the highest level of information it contains, usually by placing appropriate initials in parentheses at the beginning of the paragraph, title, or caption. Commonly, one must affix a brightly colored cover sheet to the cover of each classified document to prevent unauthorized observation of classified material ([[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|shoulder surfing]]) and to remind users to lock up unattended documents. The most sensitive material requires [[Two-man rule|two-person integrity]], where two cleared individuals are responsible for the material at all times. Approved containers for such material have two separate combination locks, both of which must be opened to access the contents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nRestrictions dictate shipment methods for classified documents. Top Secret material must go by special courier; Secret material within the U.S. via [[registered mail]]; and, Confidential material by [[Certified Mail|certified mail]]. Electronic transmission of classified information largely requires the use of National Security Agency approved/certified [[Type 1 product|\"Type 1\"]] cryptosystems using NSA's unpublished and classified [[NSA Suite A Cryptography|Suite A]] algorithms. The classification of the Suite A algorithms categorizes the hardware that store them as a [[Controlled Cryptographic Item]] (CCI) under the [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]], or ITAR. CCI equipment and keying material must be controlled and stored with heightened physical security, even when the device is not processing classified information or contains no cryptographic key. NSA is currently implementing what it's calling [[Suite B]] which is a group of commercial algorithms such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES), [[Secure Hash Algorithm (disambiguation)|Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)]], [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]] (ECDSA) and [[Elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] (ECDH). Suite B provides protection for data up to Top Secret on non-CCI devices, which is especially useful in high risk environments or operations needed to prevent Suite A compromise. These less stringent hardware requirements stem from the device not having to \"protect\" classified Suite A algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/ |title=NSA Suite B Cryptography \u2013 NSA/CSS |publisher=Nsa.gov |accessdate=2013-07-04}}</ref>\n\nSpecialized computer [[operating system]]s known as [[trusted operating system]]s are available for processing classified information. These systems enforce the classification and labeling rules described above in software. Since 2005, however, they are not considered secure enough to allow uncleared users to share computers with classified activities. Thus, if one creates an unclassified document on a secret device, the resultant data is classified secret until it can be manually reviewed. Computer networks for sharing classified information are segregated by the highest sensitivity level they are allowed to transmit, for example, [[SIPRNet]] (Secret) and [[JWICS]] (Top Secret-SCI).\n\nThe destruction of certain types of classified documents requires burning, [[paper shredder|shredding]], pulping or pulverizing using approved procedures and must be witnessed and logged.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Classified computer data presents special problems. ''See'' [[Data remanence]].\n\n===Lifetime commitment===\nWhen a cleared individual leaves the job or employer for which they were granted access to classified information, they are formally debriefed from the program. [[Debriefing]] is an administrative process that accomplishes two main goals: it creates a formal record that the individual no longer has access to the classified information for that program; and it reminds the individual of their lifetime commitment to protect that information. Typically, the individual is asked to sign another [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA), similar to that which they signed when initially briefed, and this document serves as the formal record. The debriefed individual does not lose their [[security clearance]]; they have only surrendered the need to know for information related to that particular job.\n\n==Classifications and clearances between U.S. government agencies==\n\n[[File:Goldwater casey nyt leak.png|right|thumb|250px|Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] reprimanding CIA director [[William J. Casey]] for Secret info showing up in ''[[The New York Times]]'', but then saying it was over-classified to begin with. 1983]]\n\nIn the past, clearances did not necessarily transfer between various U.S. government agencies. For example, an individual cleared for Department of Defense Top Secret had to undergo another investigation before being granted a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] [[Q clearance]]. Agencies are now supposed to honor background investigations by other agencies if they are still current. Because most security clearances only apply inside the agency where the holder works, if one needs to meet with another agency to discuss classified matters, it is possible and necessary to pass one's clearance to the other agency. For example, officials visiting at the White House from other government agencies would pass their clearances to the Executive Office of the President (EOP).\n\nThe Department of Energy security clearance required to access Top Secret Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, and National Security Information, as well as Secret Restricted Data, is a [[Q clearance]]. The lower-level [[L clearance]] is sufficient for access to Secret Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information, as well as Confidential Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.<ref>Los Alamos National Laboratory, [http://www.lanl.gov/security/clearances/index.shtml Clearance Processing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011093349/http://www.lanl.gov/security/clearances/index.shtml |date=October 11, 2006 }}.

At one time, a person might hold both a TS and a Q clearance, but that duplication and cost is no longer required. For all practical purposes, Q is equivalent to Top Secret, and L is equivalent to Secret.\n\nContrary to popular lore, the [[Yankee White]] clearance given to personnel who work directly with the President is not a classification. Individuals having Yankee White clearances undergo extensive background investigations. The criteria include U.S. citizenship, unquestionable loyalty, and an absolute absence of any foreign influence over the individual, his family, or \"persons to whom the individual is closely linked\".<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/nuclear-football.htm The Football], GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref name=\"dtic.mil-5210.87\">[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/521087p.pdf Selection of DoD Military and Civilian Personnel and Contractor Employees for Assignment to Presidential Support Activities (PSAs)], Department of Defense Instruction No. 5210.87 (November 30, 1998).</ref> Also, they must not have traveled (save while in government employ and at the instructions of the United States) to countries that are considered to be unfriendly to the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Yankee White cleared personnel are granted access to any information for which they have a need to know, regardless of which organization classified it or at what level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSee also the Single Scope Background Investigation below, along with explicit compartmented access indoctrination. Some compartments, especially intelligence-related, may require a [[polygraph]] examination, although the reliability of the polygraph is controversial. The NSA uses the polygraph early in the clearance process{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} while the CIA uses it at the end, which may suggest divergent opinions on the proper use of the polygraph.\n\n==Categories that are not classifications==\n[[compartmentalization (information security)|Compartments]] also exist, that employ [[code name|code words]] pertaining to specific projects and are used to more easily manage individual access requirements. Code words are not levels of classification themselves, but a person working on a project may have the code word for that project added to his file, and then will be given access to the relevant documents. Code words may also label the sources of various documents; for example, code words are used to indicate that a document may break the cover of intelligence operatives if its content becomes known. The [[World War II|WWII]] code word ''[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]'' identified information found by decrypting German ciphers, such as the [[Enigma machine]], and which\u2014regardless of its own significance\u2014might inform the Germans that Enigma was broken if they became aware that it was known.\n\n===Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP)===\nThe terms \"[[Sensitive Compartmented Information]]\" (SCI)<ref>{{cite web\n  | author = Director of Central Intelligence\n  | title = Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/7: Security Controls on the Dissemination of Intelligence Information\n  | date=June 1998\n  | url = https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/dcid1-7.html\n  | id = sci\n  | accessdate = September 30, 2007| author-link = Director of Central Intelligence\n }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510521m_vol3.pdf|title=Directives Division|author=|date=|website=www.dtic.mil|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and \"[[Special Access Program]]\" (SAP)<ref>{{cite web\n  | author = United States Department of Defense\n  | title = Department of Defense Overprint to the National Industrial Security Program\n  | date=February 1995\n  | url = https://fas.org/sgp/library/nispom_dod_overprint.pdf\n  | id = nispom\n  }}</ref> are widely misunderstood as classification levels or specific clearances.\n\nIn fact, the terms refer to methods of handling certain types of classified information that relate to specific national-security topics or programs (whose existence may not be publicly acknowledged) or the sensitive nature of which requires special handling, and thereby those accessing it require special approval to access it.\n\nThe paradigms for these two categories, SCI originating in the intelligence community and SAP in the Department of Defense, formalize 'Need to Know' and addresses two key logistical issues encountered in the day-to-day control of classified information:\n\n:* Individuals with a legitimate need to know may not be able to function effectively without knowing certain facts about their work. However, granting all such individuals a blanket DoD clearance (often known as a \"collateral\" clearance) at the Top Secret level would be undesirable, not to mention prohibitively expensive.\n\n:* The government may wish to limit certain types of sensitive information only to those who work directly on related programs, regardless of the collateral clearance they hold. Thus, even someone with a Top Secret clearance cannot gain access to its Confidential information unless it is specifically granted.\n\nTo be clear, \"collateral\" simply means one lacks special access (e.g. SCI, SAP, COMSEC, NATO, etc.). Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret are all, by themselves, collateral clearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs|title=Security Clearance FAQs - ClearedJobs.Net|author=|date=|website=clearedjobs.net|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nSAP and SCI are usually found at the Top Secret classification, but there is no prohibition of applying such segregation to Confidential and Secret information.<ref>http://www.nicoe.capmed.mil/About%20Us/Shared%20Documents/security_clearance_faq.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/536733|title=GSA Clearance Verification-Passing Procedures|author=|date=|website=www.gsa.gov|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSAP and SCI implementation are roughly equivalent, and it is reasonable to discuss their implementation as one topic. For example, SAP material needs to be stored and used in a facility much like the SCIF described below.\n\nDepartment of Energy information, especially the more sensitive SIGMA categories, may be treated as SAP or SCI.\n\n====Access to compartmented information====\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2008}}\nPersonnel who require knowledge of SCI or SAP information fall into two general categories:\n* Persons with a need to know\n* Persons with actual access\n\nAccess to classified information is not authorized based on clearance status. Access is only permitted to individuals after determining they have a need to know. Need-to-know is a determination that an individual requires access to specific classified information in the performance of (or assist in the performance of) lawful and authorized government functions and duties.\n\nTo achieve selective separation of program information while still allowing full access to those working on the program, a separate compartment, identified by a unique codeword, is created for the information. This entails establishing communication channels, data storage, and work locations (SCIF\u2014[[Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility]]), which are physically and logically separated not only from the unclassified world, but from general Department of Defense classified channels as well.\n\nThus established, all information generated within the compartment is classified according to the general rules above. However, to emphasize that the information is compartmented, all documents are marked with both the classification level and the codeword (and the caveat \"Handle via <compartment name> Channels Only\", or \"Handle via <compartment names> Jointly\" if the document contains material from multiple programs).\n\n[[File:BYEMAN Coversheet.jpg|thumb|right|Cover sheet for information protected by the [[Byeman Control System|BYEMAN control system]]]]\nExamples of such SCI control systems are:<ref>Top Level Telecommunications, [http://electrospaces.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-us-classification-system.html The US Classification System]</ref>\n* COMINT or Special Intelligence (SI)\n* ENDSEAL (EL)\n* TALENT KEYHOLE (TK)\n* HUMINT Control System (HCS)\n* KLONDIKE (KDK)\n* RESERVE (RSV)\n* [[BYEMAN]] (BYE or B)\n\nThe COMINT control system is for sensitive [[signals intelligence]] information and contains several compartments, like:\n* Very Restricted Knowledge (VRK)\n* Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI), which is used by NSA and restricted to very few people.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/nsa-surveillance-revelations-encryption-expert-chat | title=Explaining the latest NSA revelations \u2013 Q&A with internet privacy experts | publisher=The Guardian newspaper | date=September 6, 2013 | author=Ball, James | accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>\n* GAMMA\n\nA person is granted access to a specific compartment after the individual has: (a) had a [[Single Scope Background Investigation]] similar to that required for a collateral Top Secret clearance; (b) been \"read into\" or briefed on the nature and sensitivity of the compartment; and (c) signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA).\n\nThe individual then has access to all information in the compartment, regardless of its classification (and assuming a need to know). However, access does not extend to any other compartment; i.e., there is no single \"SCI clearance\" analogous to DoD collateral Top Secret. The requirements for DCID 6/4 eligibility (a determination that an individual is eligible for access to SCI), subsumes the requirements for a TS collateral clearance. Being granted DCID 6/4 eligibility includes the simultaneous granting of a TS collateral clearance, as adjudicators are required to adjudicate to the highest level that the investigation (SSBI) supports.\n\n====Groups of compartmented information====\n{{Page numbers needed|section|date=September 2008}}\nSAPs in the Department of Defense are subdivided into three further groups, as defined in {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|10|119}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/nispom.htm |title=National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThere is no public reference to whether SCI is divided in the same manner, but news reports reflecting that only the [[Gang of Eight (intelligence)|Gang of Eight]] members of Congress are briefed on certain intelligence activities, it may be assumed that similar rules apply for SCI or for programs with overlapping SAP and SCI content.\n\nThe groups for Department of Defense SAPs are:\n\n:* '''Acknowledged''': appears as a line item as \"classified project\" or the equivalent in the federal budget, although details of its content are not revealed. The budget element will associate the SAP with a Department of Defense component organization, such as a Military Department (e.g. [[Department of the Navy]]), a Combatant Command (e.g. [[U.S. Special Operations Command]]) or a Defense Agency (e.g. [[Defense Information Systems Agency]].)\n:* '''Unacknowledged''': no reference to such SAPs is found in the publicly published federal budget; its funding is hidden in a classified annex, often called the \"black budget\". The Congressional defense committees, however, are briefed on the specifics of such SAPs.\n:* '''Waived''': At the sole discretion of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], on a case-by-case basis in the interest of national security, there is no mention in the budget at all, and only the \"Big 6\" members of Congress; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the armed services committees, the appropriations committees and the defense appropriations subcommittees; receive notification of such SAPs.\n\nExamples of SCI topics are human intelligence, communications intelligence, and intelligence collected by satellites. One or more compartments may be created for each area, and each of these compartments may contain multiple subcompartments (e.g., a specific HUMINT operation), themselves with their own code names.\n\nSpecific compartmented programs will have their own specific rules. For example, it is standard that no person is allowed unaccompanied access to a nuclear weapon or to command-and-control systems for nuclear weapons. Personnel with nuclear-weapons access are under the [[Personnel Reliability Program]].\n\nSome highly sensitive SAP or SCI programs may also use the \"no lone zone\" method (that is, a physical location into which no one is allowed to enter unaccompanied) described for nuclear weapons.\n\n===Handling caveats===\nThe United States also has a system of restrictive [[:wikt:caveat|caveats]] that can be added to a document: these are constantly changing, but can include (in abbreviated form) a requirement that the document not be shared with a civilian contractor or not leave a specific room. These restrictions are not classifications in and of themselves; rather, they restrict the dissemination of information within those who have the appropriate clearance level and possibly the need to know the information. Remarks such as \"EYES ONLY\" and \"DO NOT COPY<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf|title=Memorandum of July 25, 2019, telephone conversation between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\" also limit the restriction. One violating these directives might be guilty of violating a lawful order or mishandling classified information.\n\nFor ease of use, caveats and abbreviations have been adopted that can be included in the summary classification marking (header/footer) to enable the restrictions to be identified at a glance. They are sometimes known as Dissemination Control Abbreviations.<ref name=\"CIA_1977_ag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov|title=Agriculture-Related Pollution in the USSR |date=November 1977 |publisher=CIA |accessdate=2010-01-18 }}</ref> Some of these caveats are (or were):\n:*FOUO: [[For Official Use Only]].

Such information is \"[[born secret|classified from birth]]\", unlike all other sensitive information, which must be classified by some authorized individual. However, authorized classifiers still must determine whether documents or material are classified or restricted.\n\nThe [[U.S. Department of Energy]] recognizes two types of Restricted Data:<ref>Los Alamos National Laboratory, [http://www.hr.lanl.gov/SCourses/All/PortionMarking/define.htm ''Guide to Portion Marking Documents and Material'', Appendix B, Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011093350/http://www.hr.lanl.gov/SCourses/All/PortionMarking/define.htm |date=October 11, 2006 }}. Retrieved December 15, 2006.</ref>\n* '''Restricted Data.''' Data concerning the design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy.\n* '''Formerly Restricted Data.''' Classified information jointly determined by the DOE and the Department of Defense to be related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and removed from the Restricted Data category.\n\nDocuments containing such information must be marked \"RESTRICTED DATA\" (RD) or \"FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA\" (FRD) in addition to any other classification marking. Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are further categorized as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential.\n\n====SIGMA categories and Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information====\nRESTRICTED DATA contains further compartments. The Department of Energy establishes a list of SIGMA Categories<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = [no title, apparent extract from University of California laboratory security briefing]\n  | publisher = University of California\n  | date = n.d.\n  | url = http://labs.ucop.edu/internet/security/brief04/docs/sigmas.pdf\n  | id = sigmas\n  | accessdate = 2007-09-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908141749/http://labs.ucop.edu/internet/security/brief04/docs/sigmas.pdf |archivedate = 2006-09-08}}</ref> for more fine-grained control than RESTRICTED DATA.\n[[Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information]] (CNWDI, colloquially pronounced ''\"Sin-Widdy\"'') reveals the theory of operation or design of the components of a nuclear weapon. As such, it would be SIGMA 1 or SIGMA 2 material, assuming [[laser fusion]] is not involved in the information.\n\nAccess to CNWDI is supposed to be kept to the minimum number of individuals needed. In written documents, paragraphs containing the material, assuming it is Top Secret, would be marked (TS//RD-CNWDI). SIGMA information of special sensitivity may be handled much like SAP or SCI material (q.v.)\n\n====Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information====\nWhile most [[Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information]] is sensitive, it may or may not be classified. The desired power densities of naval reactors make their design peculiar to military use, specifically high-displacement, high-speed vessels. The proliferation of quieter- or higher-performance marine propulsion systems presents a national-security threat to the United States. Due to this fact, all but the most basic information concerning NNPI is classified. The [[United States Navy]] recognizes that the public has an interest in environmental, safety, and health information, and that the basic research the Navy carries out can be useful to industry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n==Sharing of classified information with other countries==\nIn cases where the United States wishes to share classified information bilaterally (or multilaterally) with a country that has a sharing agreement, the information is marked with \"REL TO USA\", (release) and the three-letter country code.<ref>See the WATERWITCH document at right for an example of a document marked REL TO USA, FVEY</ref> For example, if the U.S. wanted to release classified information to the government of [[Canada]], it would mark the document \"REL TO USA, CAN\". There are also group releases, such as [[NATO]], [[Five Eyes|FVEY]] or [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA]]. Those countries would have to maintain the classification of the document at the level originally classified (Top Secret, Secret, etc.).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Claims of U.S. government misuse of the classification system==\n\n{{quote box|quote=It is desired that no document be released which refers to [[Unethical human experimentation in the United States|experiments with humans]] and might have adverse effect on public opinion or result in legal suits.

Russo and Ellsberg were prosecuted under Espionage Law. The case prompted Harold Edgar & Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. to write a review of Espionage law in the 1973 ''Columbia Law Review''. Their article was entitled \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\". In it, they point out that Espionage law '''does not criminalize classified information''', only '''national defense''' information. They point out that Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to make the disclosing of classified information illegal, in and of itself. Instead, Congress has strictly limited which sort of classified information is illegal, and under which specific circumstances it is illegal. i.e. in {{uscsub|18|798}} Congress specifically criminalized leaking cryptographic information that is classified, but when it passed the law it specifically stated the law didn't criminalize disclosing other types of classified information.<ref name=edgsch>The Edgar & Schmidt 1973 ''Columbia Law Review'', \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\".

They suggest such a classification is intended to apply to information relating to things whose possible existence is to be denied, such as aliens, as opposed to things whose potential existence may be recognized, but for which access to information regarding specific programs would be denied as classified. The British government, for example, denied for several decades that they were either involved or interested in UFO sightings. However, in 2008, the government revealed they have monitored UFO activity for at least the past 30 years.<ref>{{cite web \n |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/\n |title=UFOs - The National Archives \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009043543/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos/\n |archivedate=October 9, 2018 \n }}</ref> The existence of an \"Above Top Secret\" classification is considered by some as unnecessary to keep the existence of aliens a secret, as they say information at the Top Secret level, or any level for that matter, can be restricted on the basis of [[need to know]]. Thus, the U.S. government could conceal an alien project without having to resort to another level of clearance, as need to know would limit the ability to have access to the information. Some suggest that claims of the existence of such a classification level may be based on the unsubstantiated belief that the levels of classification are themselves classified. As such, they feel that books claiming to contain \"Above Top Secret\" information on UFOs or [[remote viewing]] should arguably be taken with a [[grain of salt]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.topsecretwriters.com/2009/11/above-top-secret/\n|title=Above Top Secret\n|first=Ryan\n|last=Dube\n|publisher=Top Secret Writers\n|date=November 2009}}</ref>\n\nWithout making a judgment on if such classifications have been used for space aliens, it is a reality that even the names of some compartments were classified, and certainly the meaning of the code names.

BYEMAN, the main NRO compartment, was classified as a full word, although the special security offices could refer, in an unclassified way, to \"B policy\".\n\n==Responsible agencies==\n\nAny agency designated by the President can originate classified information if it meets the content criteria; each agency is responsible for safeguarding and declassifying its own documents. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA) has custody of classified documents from defunct agencies, and also houses the National Declassification Center (since 2010) and [[Information Security Oversight Office]]. The [[Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel]] has representatives from the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice; the National Archives, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; the National Security Advisor; the Central Intelligence Agency; and Information Security Oversight Office.<ref>[[Executive Order 13526]], Sec. 5.3.</ref>\n\n==Declassification==\n\n[[Declassification]] is the process of removing the classification of a document and opening it for public inspection.\n\n===Automatic declassification===\nIn accordance with [[Executive Order 13526]], published January 5, 2010 (which superseded [[Executive Order 12958]], as amended), an executive agency must declassify its documents after 25 years unless they fall under one of the nine narrow exemptions outlined by section 3.3 of the order. Classified documents 25 years or older must be reviewed by any and all agencies that possess an interest in the sensitive information found in the document. Documents classified for longer than 50 years must concern human intelligence sources or weapons of mass destruction, or get special permission.<ref>[[Executive Order 12958]], Section 3.3 (h)</ref> All documents older than 75 years must have special permission.<ref>[[Executive Order 12958]], Section 3.3 (h)(3)</ref>\n\n===Systematic declassification===\nThe Order also requires that agencies establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review, based on the new and narrower criteria. This only applies to records that are of permanent historical value and less than 25 years old. Section 3.4 of Order 13526, directs agencies to prioritize the systematic review of records based upon the degree of researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review.\n\n=== Mandatory Declassification Review ===\nA Mandatory Declassification Review, or MDR, is requested by an individual in an attempt to declassify a document for release to the public. These challenges are presented to the agency whose equity, or \"ownership\", is invested in the document. Once an MDR request has been submitted to an agency for the review of a particular document, the agency must respond either with an approval, a denial, or the inability to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of the requested document. After the initial request, an appeal can be filed with the agency by the requester. If the agency refuses to declassify that document, then a decision from a higher authority can be provided by the appellate panel, the [[Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel]] (ISCAP).\n\n===Freedom of Information Act===\n\nThe U.S. [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on July 4, 1966, took effect the following year, and was amended in 1974, 1976, 1986, 1996 and 2002 (in 1974 over President Ford's veto). This act allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the U.S. government. Any member of the public may ask for a classified document to be declassified and made available for any reason. The requestor is required to specify with reasonable certainty the documents of interest. If the agency refuses to declassify, the decision can be taken to the courts for a review. The FOIA does not guarantee that requested documents will be released; refusals usually fall under one of the nine of the declassification exemptions that protect highly sensitive information.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===History of National Archives and Records Administration role===\n\nAfter declassification, the documents from many agencies are accessioned at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] and put on the open shelves for the public. NARA also reviews documents for declassification.\n\nNARA first established a formal declassification program for records in 1972, and between 1973 and 1996 reviewed nearly 650 million pages of historically valuable federal records related to World War II, the Korean War, and American foreign policy in the 1950s as part of its systematic declassification review program. From 1996 to 2006, NARA had processed and released close to 460 million pages of federal records, working in partnership with the agencies that originated the records. Over the years, NARA has processed more than 1.1 billion pages of national security classified federal records, resulting in the declassification and release of ninety-one percent of the records.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nNARA has also provided significant support to several special projects to review and release federal records on topics of extraordinary public interest such as [[Prisoner of war|POW]]/[[Missing in action|MIAs]] or [[Nazi war crime]]s. Additionally, NARA works closely with reference archivists to ensure that the federal records most in demand by researchers receive priority for declassification review and performs review on demand for individuals who need records that do not fall into a priority category. NARA has improved or developed electronic systems to support declassification, automating some processes and thus ensuring a more complete record of declassification actions. With assistance from the Air Force, NARA established{{when|date=March 2013}} the Interagency Referral Center (IRC) in order to support agencies as they seek access to their equities in federal records at the National Archives at College Park and to ensure that high-demand records are processed first.\n\nIn 2009, [[Executive Order 13526]] created the [[National Declassification Center]] at NARA, which also houses the [[Information Security Oversight Office]].\n\n==== Presidential libraries ====\n\n[[Presidential libraries]] hold in excess of 30 million classified pages, including approximately 8 million pages from the administrations of Presidents Hoover through Carter, that were subject to automatic declassification on December 31, 2006. The foreign policy materials in Presidential collections are among the highest-level foreign policy documents in the Federal government and are of significant historical value.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2006, the national [[Presidential Library]] system reviewed, declassified, and released 1,603,429 pages of presidential materials using systematic guidelines delegated to the Archivist of the United States.

Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt.

Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.  It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959\u20131962).\n* WWII U.S.N.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

The use of USMC organization allowed for smooth co-ordination, integration or interface between NCF and Marine Corps elements.  Additionally, CBs could be deployed individually or in multiples as the project scope and scale dictated. What distinguishes Seabees from [[Combat Engineers]] are the skill sets.

Moreell's model.\n\nSince creation Seabees have received all their advanced military training from the Marine Corps.  As  such, it is strictly standard conventional warfare.  Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt.

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt.

Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

From \"A\" School, trainees most often report to a NMCB or ACB. At those commands new Seabees will go through four-weeks of Expeditionary Combat Skills. ECS is also required for those who report to a unit in the [[Navy Expeditionary Combat Command]]. ECS is basic combat-training in: map reading, combat first aid, conducting recon, and other combat-related skills. Half of each course is spent learning basic marksmanship and qualifying with a [[M16 rifle#M16A2|M16A2]] or [[M16 rifle#M16A3|M16A3]] rifle and the [[Beretta M9|M9 service pistol]]. Those posted to Alfa Company of a NMCB may be assigned to a crew-served weapon: [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|MK 19]] 40mm grenade launcher, the [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] .50-caliber machine gun, or the [[M240 machine gun]]. Many reserve units still field the [[M60 machine gun]]. Until 2012, Seabees wore the [[U.S. Woodland]] camouflage uniform or the [[Desert Camouflage Uniform]], the last U.S. military to do so, but have transitioned to the Navy Working Uniform NWU Type III.

They had been in existence less than four years when this happened and the Navy had not created a Historical Branch or Archive for the NCF.  So, there was no central archive for Seabee history. As time passed, first with Korea and then Vietnam, Construction Battalions were reactivated with the units having no idea what the WWII insignia had been so they made new ones.\n\n==Seabee Combat Warfare Insignia and Peltier Award==\n[[File:Navy Seabee Combat Warfare Specialist Insignia.png|350px|right|thumb|SCW insignia: officer and enlisted]]\nThe military qualification badge for the Seabees is known as the Seabee combat warfare specialist insignia (SCW).

For requirements, see: Fleet Marine Force Warfare Specialist (EFMFWS) Program per [[OPNAV Instruction]] 1414.4B.\n\nThe Peltier Award is given to the \"best of type\" active duty Naval Construction Battalions.  It was instituted by Rear Admiral Eugene J. Peltier CEC and has been given annually since 1960. He is a former head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (1959\u20131962).\n* WWII U.S.N.

The NCF primarily uses the Seabee barges .  Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea. These ships have an elevator system for loading the barges out of the water at the stern onto the vessel.   Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

Head shaving has also appeared in other youth-oriented [[subculture]]s which include [[punk subculture|punk]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], [[black metal]], [[metalcore]], [[Nu metal]], [[hip hop]], [[techno music]], and [[neo-nazi]] scenes.\n\n===Sexuality, gender and LGBT===\n[[File:Amber Rose - 2014 People Magazine Awards (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Amber Rose]]]]\nA sexual fetish involving erotic head shaving is called [[trichophilia]]. While a shaved head on a man relates to virility, a shaved head on a woman typically connotes [[androgyny]], especially when combined with traditionally [[feminine]] [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]]. It may, but does not always, express membership in the [[bisexual]], [[lesbian]] and [[genderqueer]] communities. Similarly, [[gay men]] sometimes incorporate a shaven head into their overall look, particularly amongst the [[bear (gay culture)|bear]] subculture. Specifically, the [[stereotypical]] \"[[Castro clone]]\" look commonly shave their heads in order to project a [[homoerotic]] ultra-[[masculine]] image. [[Drag queen]]s have sometimes adopted shaven heads, again, to express a genderqueer image. In the [[BDSM]] community, shaving a submissive or slave's head is often used to demonstrate powerlessness, or submission to the will of a dominant.\n\n===Fundraising and support===\n====Cancer====\n[[File:46_mommas_shave.jpg|thumb|Women shaving their head in the 46 mommas event which is a fund-raising and awareness program of cancer]]\nIn solidarity with [[cancer]] sufferers, some people chose to shave their heads \u2013 particularly as part of fund-raising efforts. (Baldness is a well-known side-effect of the [[chemotherapy]] often used to treat cancer, and some people shave their heads before undergoing such treatment.)\n\n====Covhead-19 Challenge====\nDuring the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], many countries imposed strict [[lockdown]] procedures and actively encouraged members of the public to self-isolate.\n\nInitially many people, particularly men, began to shave their heads as a way of combatting boredom during self-isolation, in addition to the fact that lockdown prevented people from being able to see their [[barber]]. <ref>[https://news.sky.com/story/amp/coronavirus-why-are-so-many-people-shaving-their-heads-11968023 \"Why are so many people shaving their heads?\"]</ref> \n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], a fundraiser began in order to support the [[NHS]], which, like many other healthcare systems,suffered from the enormous pressure of the pandemic. The fundraiser was started by a user named 'Egg-head' on the fundraising website [[Just Giving]] with a goal of \u00a3100,000. Dubbed the 'Covhead-19 Challenge', it encourages people to shave their heads whilst also donating money for the NHS. Various celebrities have also taken part.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-covhead-challenge-what-is-it-charity-raise-money-nhs-a9433241.html</ref>\n\n===Fiction===\nIn modern settings, shaved heads are often associated with characters who display a stern and disciplined or hardcore attitude. Examples include those played by [[Yul Brynner]] and [[Vin Diesel]]; [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Kojak]]; [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in roles such as [[Mace Windu]] and [[Nick Fury in other media#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Nick Fury]]; and [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]] in ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992).\n\nShaved heads are also associated with [[villain]]s, such as [[Superman]]'s archenemy [[Lex Luthor]], [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', or [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.\n\n[[Goatee]] beards are often worn to complement the look or add sophistication. A look that was popularised in the mid-1990s by wrestler, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. For most of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', [[Bryan Cranston]] wore a Van Dyke beard along with a clean shaven head, contributing to the iconic image of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Heisenberg]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|title=Gateway Episodes: Breaking Bad|date=2013-09-27|first=Jeremy|last=Stahl|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/09/27/breaking_bad_finale_catch_up_by_starting_with_is_crazy_handful_of_nothin.html}}</ref>\n\nIn futuristic settings, shaved heads are often associated with bland uniformity, especially in sterile futuristic settings such as '' [[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=THX 1138|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/48303/THX-1138/overview}}</ref> In [[Fritz Lang]]'s early [[science fiction]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), hundreds of extras had their heads shaved to represent the oppressed masses of a future [[dystopia]].\n\nIt is less common for female characters to have shaved heads; however, some female characters are bald.

Head shaving has also appeared in other youth-oriented [[subculture]]s which include [[punk subculture|punk]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], [[black metal]], [[metalcore]], [[Nu metal]], [[hip hop]], [[techno music]], and [[neo-nazi]] scenes.\n\n===Sexuality, gender and LGBT===\n[[File:Amber Rose - 2014 People Magazine Awards (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Amber Rose]]]]\nA sexual fetish involving erotic head shaving is called [[trichophilia]]. While a shaved head on a man relates to virility, a shaved head on a woman typically connotes [[androgyny]], especially when combined with traditionally [[feminine]] [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]]. It may, but does not always, express membership in the [[bisexual]], [[lesbian]] and [[genderqueer]] communities. Similarly, [[gay men]] sometimes incorporate a shaven head into their overall look, particularly amongst the [[bear (gay culture)|bear]] subculture. Specifically, the [[stereotypical]] \"[[Castro clone]]\" look commonly shave their heads in order to project a [[homoerotic]] ultra-[[masculine]] image. [[Drag queen]]s have sometimes adopted shaven heads, again, to express a genderqueer image. In the [[BDSM]] community, shaving a submissive or slave's head is often used to demonstrate powerlessness, or submission to the will of a dominant.\n\n===Fundraising and support===\n====Cancer====\n[[File:46_mommas_shave.jpg|thumb|Women shaving their head in the 46 mommas event which is a fund-raising and awareness program of cancer]]\nIn solidarity with [[cancer]] sufferers, some people chose to shave their heads \u2013 particularly as part of fund-raising efforts. (Baldness is a well-known side-effect of the [[chemotherapy]] often used to treat cancer, and some people shave their heads before undergoing such treatment.)\n\n====Covhead-19 Challenge====\nDuring the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], many countries imposed strict [[lockdown]] procedures and actively encouraged members of the public to self-isolate.\n\nInitially many people, particularly men, began to shave their heads as a way of combatting boredom during self-isolation, in addition to the fact that lockdown prevented people from being able to see their [[barber]]. <ref>[https://www.news.sky.com/story/amp/coronavirus-why-are-so-many-people-shaving-their-heads-11968023 \"Why are so many people shaving their heads?\"]</ref> \n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], a fundraiser began in order to support the [[NHS]], which, like many other healthcare systems,suffered from the enormous pressure of the pandemic. The fundraiser was started by a user named 'Egg-head' on the fundraising website [[Just Giving]] with a goal of \u00a3100,000. Dubbed the 'Covhead-19 Challenge', it encourages people to shave their heads whilst also donating money for the NHS. Various celebrities have also taken part.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/coronavirus-covhead-challenge-what-is-it-charity-raise-money-nhs-a9433241.html</ref>\n\n===Fiction===\nIn modern settings, shaved heads are often associated with characters who display a stern and disciplined or hardcore attitude. Examples include those played by [[Yul Brynner]] and [[Vin Diesel]]; [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Kojak]]; [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in roles such as [[Mace Windu]] and [[Nick Fury in other media#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Nick Fury]]; and [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]] in ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992).\n\nShaved heads are also associated with [[villain]]s, such as [[Superman]]'s archenemy [[Lex Luthor]], [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz]] in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', or [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.\n\n[[Goatee]] beards are often worn to complement the look or add sophistication. A look that was popularised in the mid-1990s by wrestler, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]. For most of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', [[Bryan Cranston]] wore a Van Dyke beard along with a clean shaven head, contributing to the iconic image of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Heisenberg]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|title=Gateway Episodes: Breaking Bad|date=2013-09-27|first=Jeremy|last=Stahl|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/09/27/breaking_bad_finale_catch_up_by_starting_with_is_crazy_handful_of_nothin.html}}</ref>\n\nIn futuristic settings, shaved heads are often associated with bland uniformity, especially in sterile futuristic settings such as '' [[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=THX 1138|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/48303/THX-1138/overview}}</ref> In [[Fritz Lang]]'s early [[science fiction]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), hundreds of extras had their heads shaved to represent the oppressed masses of a future [[dystopia]].\n\nIt is less common for female characters to have shaved heads; however, some female characters are bald.
