The [[Crucifixion]] scene shows three figures: Christ on the cross, with Mary and Saint John are at the foot of the cross, one on each side. The figures are arranged in the shape of a triangle against the empty golden background. Each figure is separate and unified with the other figures. This balanced arrangement is similar to the way Greek sculptors placed their figures in the pediments of temples. The figure of St. John is depicted in a bending position, with his weight on one leg \u2013 a pose used by Greek sculptors. The body of Christ is depicted in a classic, athletic style, but unlike Greek sculpture, the anatomy is not true to life. The faces of Saint John and the Madonna have the flatness and heavy lines of the Byzantine style, but they express the calm of Greek statues.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', \"the ensemble represents a visualization of the Christian [[cosmos]], its effect created by an intricately conceived interplay of pictures and architecture. Space in fact fuses the decoration into one giant image, in which the ruler, hailed by the prophets surrounding him, presides in his sphere above the host of saints that people the lower part of the room.\"\n\nOther important mosaics include: Prayers of Joachim and Anna, Annunciation of Joachim, The Virgin with Anna, Annunciation of the Mother of God, The Baptism of Christ, The Washing of the Disciples, Entering Jerusalem, Christ at the Last Supper, The Crucifixion, The Resurrection, Dormition of the Mother of God, Angel to Receive the Mother of God, Prophet Sophonia, St. Bacchus.\n\nByzantine art often survives as an ecclesiastical art. The Daphni Monastery was built during a period of [[Macedonian Renaissance|renaissance in culture and art]] and a return to classical traditions. The figures in the mosaics are more naturalistically represented, and they blend more smoothly into their surroundings<ref name=\"Setton409\">''The Latins in Greece and the Aegean from the Fourth Crusade to the End of the Middle Ages'', K.

The bodies are heavy and rigid, common characteristics in depicting the icons of the Bishops, Monks and the Martyrs. The pictorial perspective, the figure styles and gestures, the modeling of the figures along with simplicity of design, and the dazzling splendor of color reflecting from the gold and silver tesserae distinguish the Daphni mosaics among the mosaics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries as particularly grand specimens of Byzantine art in general.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n*[[History of Roman and Byzantine domes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category|Monastery of Daphni}}\n* Cormack, Robin.

The figures are arranged in the shape of a triangle against the empty golden background. Each figure is separate and unified with the other figures. This balanced arrangement is similar to the way Greek sculptors placed their figures in the pediments of temples. The figure of St. John is depicted in a bending position, with his weight on one leg \u2013 a pose used by Greek sculptors. The body of Christ is depicted in a classic, athletic style, but unlike Greek sculpture, the anatomy is not true to life. The faces of Saint John and the Madonna have the flatness and heavy lines of the Byzantine style, but they express the calm of Greek statues.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', \"the ensemble represents a visualization of the Christian [[cosmos]], its effect created by an intricately conceived interplay of pictures and architecture. Space in fact fuses the decoration into one giant image, in which the ruler, hailed by the prophets surrounding him, presides in his sphere above the host of saints that people the lower part of the room.\"\n\nOther important mosaics include: Prayers of Joachim and Anna, Annunciation of Joachim, The Virgin with Anna, Annunciation of the Mother of God, The Baptism of Christ, The Washing of the Disciples, Entering Jerusalem, Christ at the Last Supper, The Crucifixion, The Resurrection, Dormition of the Mother of God, Angel to Receive the Mother of God, Prophet Sophonia, St. Bacchus.\n\nByzantine art often survives as an ecclesiastical art. The Daphni Monastery was built during a period of [[Macedonian Renaissance|renaissance in culture and art]] and a return to classical traditions. The figures in the mosaics are more naturalistically represented, and they blend more smoothly into their surroundings<ref name=\"Setton409\">''The Latins in Greece and the Aegean from the Fourth Crusade to the End of the Middle Ages'', K.

The bodies are heavy and rigid, common characteristics in depicting the icons of the Bishops, Monks and the Martyrs. The pictorial perspective, the figure styles and gestures, the modeling of the figures along with simplicity of design, and the dazzling splendor of color reflecting from the gold and silver tesserae distinguish the Daphni mosaics among the mosaics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries as particularly grand specimens of Byzantine art in general.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n*[[History of Roman and Byzantine domes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category|Monastery of Daphni}}\n* Cormack, Robin.

These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words\".<ref>St. Louis, K.

(pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.\n\nCluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>\n\nStutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.\n\nStuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.\n\nA clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:\n{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.<ref>{{cite web |url         = http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/cluttering/camil.html |title       = Interview with a Person who Clutters |last        = Reyes-Alami |first       = C. |date        = 2004-03-01 |accessdate  = 2006-01-01 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20051024000905/http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/cluttering/camil.html |archivedate = 2005-10-24 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\nCluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>{{cite book | last = Daly | first = David A. |author2=Burnett, Michelle L. | editor = Curlee, Richard F. | title= Stuttering and Related Disorders of Fluency | location = New York | publisher= Thieme | isbn=0-86577-764-0 | year = 1999 | page=233}}</ref>  Clutterers often have [[reading disabilities|reading]] and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.<ref>[http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 Fluency Disorders: Stuttering vs Cluttering<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729022709/http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 |date=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThe common goals of treatment for cluttering include slowing the rate of speech, heightening monitoring, using clear articulation, using acceptable and organized language, interacting with listeners, speaking naturally, and reducing excessive disfluencies.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Louis|first=Kenneth O. St|last2=Raphael|first2=Lawrence J.|last3=Myers|first3=Florence L.|last4=Bakker|first4=Klaas|date=2003|title=Cluttering Updated|url=https://leader.pubs.asha.org/doi/full/10.1044/leader.FTR1.08212003.4|journal=The ASHA Leader|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1044/leader.ftr1.08212003.4|via=}}</ref>\n\nSlowing the rate of speech can help many of the symptoms of cluttering, and can be achieved in a couple of different ways, though it is very important that Speech Language Pathologists do not nag their clients to \u201cslow down\u201d incessantly, as this does not help and can actually hinder progress. Additionally, it is important to remember that speech rate often increases when emotional arousal or stress increases. Instead of constant verbal reminders, clinicians may use a combination of [[Delayed Auditory Feedback|Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), giving out \u201cspeeding tickets\u201d (written reminders to slow down speech), or recording speech and having clients transcribe it, writing in where there is need for spaces and pauses. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany people who clutter are either unable or unwilling to think about their speech, particularly in casual speech. The strategies to slow speech down all require careful monitoring of speech, which can be very difficult for those who clutter. Imagination and careful observation are used to increase monitoring, for instance and adult who clutters may be asked to visualize themselves speaking slowly and clearly before they actually speak. Additionally, video and audio recordings may be used to show those who clutter where communication starts to break down in their speech. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn general, slowing the rate of speech and/or monitoring speech more effectively should lead to clearer articulation. However, if they do not, additional treatment is needed. These articulation treatment strategies include practicing short sentences with \u201cover-articulated\u201d, unnatural but technically correct, speech. Reading multisyllabic words and focusing on including each of the sounds is another strategy to enhance articulation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome individuals who clutter will need help learning to tell stories logically and sequentially. This can be aided by learning how to begin narratives with simple, short sentences, and slowly building to longer, more complex ones. Additionally, clinicians may transcribe cluttered speech to clients to show them run-ons and ramblings, and then ask them to just state the necessary, most important information in the utterance. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAdditional strategies that may help people who clutter include checking in, ensuring that they\u2019ve understood any non-verbal or turn-taking cues in the conversation, imitating clinician models of speech to improve natural speech, and treating any stuttering that may be co-occurring with cluttering. The two are separate disorders, but many people who clutter also stutter. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.

These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words\".<ref>St. Louis, K.

(pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.\n\nCluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>\n\nStutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.\n\nStuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.\n\nA clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:\n{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.<ref>{{cite web |url         = http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/cluttering/camil.html |title       = Interview with a Person who Clutters |last        = Reyes-Alami |first       = C. |date        = 2004-03-01 |accessdate  = 2006-01-01 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20051024000905/http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/cluttering/camil.html |archivedate = 2005-10-24 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\nCluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>{{cite book | last = Daly | first = David A. |author2=Burnett, Michelle L. | editor = Curlee, Richard F. | title= Stuttering and Related Disorders of Fluency | location = New York | publisher= Thieme | isbn=0-86577-764-0 | year = 1999 | page=233}}</ref>  Clutterers often have [[reading disabilities|reading]] and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.<ref>[http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 Fluency Disorders: Stuttering vs Cluttering<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729022709/http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 |date=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nThe common goals of treatment for cluttering include slowing the rate of speech, heightening monitoring, using clear articulation, using acceptable and organized language, interacting with listeners, speaking naturally, and reducing excessive disfluencies.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Louis|first=Kenneth O. St|last2=Raphael|first2=Lawrence J.|last3=Myers|first3=Florence L.|last4=Bakker|first4=Klaas|date=2003|title=Cluttering Updated|url=https://leader.pubs.asha.org/doi/full/10.1044/leader.FTR1.08212003.4|journal=The ASHA Leader|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1044/leader.ftr1.08212003.4|via=}}</ref>\n\nSlowing the rate of speech can help many of the symptoms of cluttering, and can be achieved in a couple of different ways, though it is very important that Speech Language Pathologists do not nag their clients to \u201cslow down\u201d incessantly, as this does not help and can actually hinder progress. Additionally, it is important to remember that speech rate often increases when emotional arousal or stress increases. Instead of constant verbal reminders, clinicians may use a combination of [[Delayed Auditory Feedback|Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), giving out \u201cspeeding tickets\u201d (written reminders to slow down speech), or recording speech and having clients transcribe it, writing in where there is need for spaces and pauses. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany people who clutter are either unable or unwilling to think about their speech, particularly in casual speech. The strategies to slow speech down all require careful monitoring of speech, which can be very difficult for those who clutter. Imagination and careful observation are used to increase monitoring, for instance and adult who clutters may be asked to visualize themselves speaking slowly and clearly before they actually speak. Additionally, video and audio recordings may be used to show those who clutter where communication starts to break down in their speech. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn general, slowing the rate of speech and/or monitoring speech more effectively should lead to clearer articulation. However, if they do not, additional treatment is needed. These articulation treatment strategies include practicing short sentences with \u201cover-articulated\u201d, unnatural but technically correct, speech. Reading multisyllabic words and focusing on including each of the sounds is another strategy to enhance articulation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSome individuals who clutter will need help learning to tell stories logically and sequentially. This can be aided by learning how to begin narratives with simple, short sentences, and slowly building to longer, more complex ones. Additionally, clinicians may transcribe cluttered speech to clients to show them run-ons and ramblings, and then ask them to just state the necessary, most important information in the utterance. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAdditional strategies that may help people who clutter include checking in, ensuring that they\u2019ve understood any non-verbal or turn-taking cues in the conversation, imitating clinician models of speech to improve natural speech, and treating any stuttering that may be co-occurring with cluttering. The two are separate disorders, but many people who clutter also stutter. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.

Varicose veins for example can now be treated by local anesthetic endovenous surgery.\n\n<!-- Epidemiology and history -->\nRates of CVI are higher in women than in men.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/53/3/149.long |title=Prevalence of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency in men and women in the general population: Edinburgh Vein Study.J Epidemiol Community Health. 1999 Mar;53(3):149-53. |journal=Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=149\u2013153 |vauthors=Evans CJ, Fowkes FG, Ruckley CV, Lee AJ |accessdate=January 8, 2015 |date=1999 |publisher=J Epidemiol Community Health.|doi=10.1136/jech.53.3.149 |pmid=10396491 |pmc=1756838 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ejves.com/article/S1078-5884(14)00271-8/abstract |title=Incidence and risk factors for venous reflux in the general population: Edinburgh Vein Study.
