The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

However, present-day Aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the [[Tiwanaku culture]] which had its capital at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western Bolivia.

Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.<ref name=\"Kolata, Alan L. 1993\"/>\n\n[[File:Inca_Expansion.svg|thumb|Inca Expansion (1438\u20131533)]]\n\nBetween 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire expanded from its capital at [[Cuzco]], [[Peru]].

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named the Republic of Bol\u00edvar in honor of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n\nIn 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis Jos\u00e9 de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica. In the battle of Tarapac\u00e1 on 7 January 1842, Peruvian militias formed by the commander Juan Buend\u00eda defeated a detachment led by Bolivian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who died in the confrontation.

The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.\n\nBetween January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices. On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ram\u00edrez]] completed the final year of his term.\n\n==== 2002\u20132005 S\u00e1nchez de Lozada / Mesa Presidency ====\nIn the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader [[Evo Morales]] ([[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Toward Socialism]], MAS) with 20.9%. A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], and social inclusion.\n\n[[File:Evo Morales in Ecuador (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Former President, [[Evo Morales]]]]\n\nIn 2003 the [[Bolivian gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, S\u00e1nchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.\n\nThe country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, [[Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez]], was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.\n\n====2005\u20132019 Morales Presidency====\n[[File:Evomorales 20050122 posesion01.jpg|thumb|Evo Morales' inauguration as President]]\n[[Evo Morales]] won the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] with 53.7% of the votes, an [[absolute majority]], unusual in Bolivian elections. On 1 May 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to [[Bolivian gas conflict|re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets]]. Fulfilling a campaign promise, on 6 August 2006, Morales opened the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly]] to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |title=Push for new Bolivia constitution |work=BBC News |date=6 August 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327011109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |archive-date=27 March 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, a conflict which came to be known as The Calancha Case arose in [[Sucre|Sucre.]] Local citizens demanded that an official discussion of the seat of government be included in the agenda of the full body of the Bolivian Constituent Assembly. The people of Sucre wanted to make Sucre the full capital of the country, including returning the executive and legislative branches to the city, but the government rejected the demand as impractical.

This also triggered a new general election in which Evo Morales was re-elected with 61.36% of the vote.

It is a region of flat land and small plateaus, all covered by extensive rain forests containing enormous biodiversity. The region is below {{convert|400|m|ft}} above sea level.\n\nBolivia has three [[drainage basin]]s:\n\n*The first is the [[Amazon River|Amazon Basin]], also called the North Basin ({{convert|724000|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/66% of the territory). The rivers of this basin generally have big [[meander]]s which form lakes such as [[Murillo Lake]] in [[Pando Department]].

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]].

The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]].

However, the country has the continent's lowest coverage levels and services are of low quality. Political and institutional instability have contributed to the weakening of the sector's institutions at the national and local levels.\n\nTwo concessions to foreign private companies in two of the three largest cities \u2013 [[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]] \u2013 were prematurely ended in 2000 and 2006 respectively. The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], manages its own water and sanitation system relatively successfully by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.\n\nAccording to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; \"technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects\"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is \"not consistent with the political change in the country\"; \"ambiguities in the social participation schemes\"; a reduction in the quantity and \nquality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.<ref name=\"PNSB\">Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008\u20132015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=28 February 2013 }}, retrieved on 30 September 2010</ref>\n\nOnly 27% of the population has access to [[improved sanitation]], 80 to 88% has access to [[improved water source]]s.

The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67\u201383|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}</ref>\n\nThe empire continued to grow with no end in sight.

Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites.

As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up.

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].

Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On 18 November 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Per\u00fa on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lavay\u00e9n organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodr\u00edguez Magari\u00f1os and threaten the port of Arica. In the battle of Tarapac\u00e1 on 7 January 1842, Peruvian militias formed by the commander Juan Buend\u00eda defeated a detachment led by Bolivian colonel Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who died in the confrontation. Bolivian troops left Tacna, Arica and Tarapac\u00e1 in February 1842, retreating towards Moquegua and Puno.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Albarrac\u00edn: La portentosa Heroicidad|last=Cavagnaro Orellana|first=Luis|publisher=Archivo Regional de Tacna|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The battles of Motoni and&nbsp; Orurillo forced the withdrawal of Bolivian forces occupying Peruvian territory and exposed Bolivia to the threat of counter-invasion.

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandior\u00e9 Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.\n*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km\u00b2|sqmi}}/13% of the territory).

Presidents [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] (1982\u201385) and [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985\u201389) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.\n\nBolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. On 11 November 2019, all senior governmental positions were vacated following a coup that forced [[Evo Morales' resignation|the resignation of Evo Morales and his government]].

The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]].
