The label was founded by [[Nuclear Blast]] CEO [[Markus Staiger]] and former vice president of [[Sumerian Records]] Shawn Keith. The label's roster includes an amalgamation of [[metalcore]] and [[rock music|rock]] bands composed of [[Don Broco]], [[Loathe (band)|Loathe]], [[Miss May I]], [[We Came as Romans]], World War Me, Holding Absence, Kingsmen, Send Request, Commonwealth, and [[Emmure]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Conception and first releases (2013) ===\nThe record label was conceptualized by the labels founders [[Markus Staiger]], the current CEO of [[Nuclear Blast|Nuclear Blast Records]], and Shawn Keith, the former vice president of [[Sumerian Records]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7415658/sharptone-records-attila-miss-may-i-we-came-as-romans|title=SharpTone Records Opens With Attila, Miss May I & We Came as Romans on Roster|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> The label has since been described as an offshoot label of Nuclear Blast that primarily focuses on rock and alternative music, similar to [[Arising Empire]] which has a focus on metalcore and punk bands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/nuclear-blast-metal-record-labels-30-year-history|title=Nuclear Blast: Metal record label\u2019s 30-year history|work=loudersound|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> In an interview, Keith spoke about the label: \"Developing this label has been very exciting for me. The opportunity to partner and cultivate new and established artists working toward broadening their global potential is thrilling. SharpTone will continue to diversify and evolve as a brand for music fans to truly identify with. We are not just another record label. We are a new-music company, allowing artists to be as creative and passionate as they choose to be.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe record label was first hinted at on September 11, 2013 when the several bands shared a mysterious teaser image reading \"A New Era of Music Begins...\" on their social media. These bands included; [[Attila (metalcore band)|Attila]], [[Don Broco]], [[Loathe (band)|Loathe]], [[Miss May I]] and [[We Came as Romans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/multiple_metalcore_bands_have_shared_this_image|title=Multiple metalcore bands have shared this image - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> The following day, the former mentioned bands, plus rock band Word War Me, were all confirmed to be members of the newly established independent music label that came to be known as SharpTone Records.<ref name=\"altpresswcar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/attila_we_came_as_romans_miss_may_i_others_leave_current_record_labels_for|title=Attila, We Came As Romans, Miss May I, others leave current record labels for new company - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> The first release of the label would be a re-issue of the debut [[EP album|EP]] ''[[Prepare Consume Proceed]]'' by UK metal band [[Loathe (band)|Loathe]] less than a month later, but the labels first [[studio album]] release would be Attila's sixth album titled ''[[Chaos (Attila album)|Chaos]]'', released November 4 the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrockreview.com/artist-news/loathe-re-release-new-ep-prepare-consume-proceed|title=Loathe Re-Release New EP, Prepare Consume Proceed - National Rock Review|website=www.nationalrockreview.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/attilas_chaos_is_as_much_a_celebration_as_it_is_a_confrontation|title=Attila\u2019s \"Chaos\" is as much a celebration as it is a confrontation - Reviews - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref> Other later releases for the year included the American release of Don Broco's ''[[Automatic (Don Broco album)|Automatic]]'', and a release of [[Craig Owens]] new side project, [[Craig Owens#badXchannels|badXchannels]], who was also signed later in 2016, with the EP being named ''WHYDFML''.

In 2018, along with singing on four new bands including [[Bleeding Through]], the label also experienced its first band to move away from the label, that band being [[Attila (metalcore band)|Attila]], who cited the want for absolute creative freedom as their reasoning for going solo without the help of any record label.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /> In 2018 the label issued [[Don Broco|Don Broco's]] ''[[Technology (Don Broco album)|Technology]]'', Sink the Ship's ''Persevere'' and [[Bleeding Through]]'s ''[[Love Will Kill All (album)|Love Will Kill All]]'' among others.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Everley|first=Dave|date=13 February 2018|title=Technology Sharptone Out Now Bedford Bro-Rock-Ers' Overdone Third Album|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/q-uk/20180213/textview|journal=Q|volume=|page=108|url-access=limited|access-date=8 May 2018|via=[[PressReader]]}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/persevere-mw0003154344/releases|title=Persevere - Sink the Ship {{!}} Releases {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n\nThe record label primarily focuses on different subgenres within [[rock music]], more specifically the [[post-hardcore]] and [[Progressive metalcore]] side of rock.<ref name=\":3\" /> Early signings included [[Attila (metalcore band)|Attila]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/attila_announce_new_album_headlining_tour|title=Attila announce new album, headlining tour - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> [[Emmure]],<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/emmure_drop_first_single_with_new_lineup_sign_deal_with_sharptone_recordsli|title=Emmure drop first single with new lineup, sign deal with SharpTone Records\u2014listen - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> Currents,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/sharptone_records_signs_new_band_and_other_news_you_might_have_missed_today|title=SharpTone Records signs new band and other news you might have missed today - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref> and LOATHE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/watch-loathes-crushing-video-for-new-song-dance-on-my-skin|title=Watch Loathe\u2019s Crushing Video For New Song \u2018Dance On My Skin\u2019 - Features - Rock Sound Magazine|website=Rock Sound Magazine|accessdate=January 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Roster==\n=== Current artists ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\nList of all current artists signed with Sharptone, listing 32 in total\n!Artist\n!Year Labelled\n!Origin\n!Genres\n|-\n\n|-\n!

The opportunity to partner and cultivate new and established artists working toward broadening their global potential is thrilling. SharpTone will continue to diversify and evolve as a brand for music fans to truly identify with. We are not just another record label. We are a new-music company, allowing artists to be as creative and passionate as they choose to be.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe record label was first hinted at on September 11, 2013 when the several bands shared a mysterious teaser image reading \"A New Era of Music Begins...\" on their social media.

Mozi.jpg|thumb|Mt. Mozi is a prominent peak at the Northern end of the range.]]\n\nThe '''Eastern Highlands''', also known as the '''Manica Highlands''', is a [[mountain range]] on the border of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]]. The Eastern Highlands extend north and south for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} through Zimbabwe's [[Manicaland Province]] and Mozambique's [[Manica Province]].<ref name=\"EnZim\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe highlands consist of three main mountain groups \u2013 The Nyanga, Bvumba, and Chimanimani mountains - and several smaller ranges. The mountains are mostly sparsely populated, covered in rich grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />\n\nThe [[Nyanga Mountains]] in the north contain Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]] (2,592 m), and [[Mutarazi Falls]], Africa's second-longest waterfall. Zimbabwe's agricultural [[Honde Valley]] lies southeast of the Nyanga range, and leads into Mozambique.\n\n[[Mutare]] is the largest city in the highlands. It is located on the Zimbabwean side of the Mutare Gap, a saddle between the Nyanga and Bvumba mountains. The main east-west road through the highlands is the [[R5 road (Zimbabwe)|A3]] (Zimbabwe) - N6 (Mozambique), which connects the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] in Mozambique to Zimbabwe's capital [[Harare]] via [[Chimoio]], [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and Mutare, with a border crossing at [[Machipanda]]. The [[Beira\u2013Bulawayo railway]] also crosses the highlands at Machipanda.\n\nThe [[Bvumba Mountains]] are centrally situated south of [[Mutare]]. They lie mostly in Zimbabwe, but a northeastern spur, Monte Vumba, reaches into Mozambique. Agricultural [[Burma Valley]] lies south and east of the Bvumba Mountains. \n\nSouth of Burma Valley, the Tsetsera, Gweni, and Tandara plateaus lie along the border, separated by east-west river valleys lying in fault rifts.<ref>Lister, L.A. (1987). \"The Erosion Surfaces of Zimbabwe\". Zimbabwe Geological Survey Bulletin #90.</ref><ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>\n\nThe [[Chimanimani Mountains]] lie south of the Mussapa Pequeno River, which divides them from the Tandara plateau. The Chimanimani range consists of a high plateau with several ridges running north and south. [[Monte Binga]] on the border is the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. Mussapa Gap is a pass through the mountains that follows the eastward-flowing Mussapa Grande River and westward-flowing Nyanyadzi River. Mussapa Gap was an important trade and migration route through the higlands for centuries.<ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>\n\nThe Rusitu-Tanganda fault, an east-west rift that carries the eastward-flowing Rusitu River and the westward flowing Tanganda River, marks the southern end of the Chimanimani Mountains. A hilly upland extends south from the fault into [[Chipinge District]], and the highest point is [[Mount Selinda]] at 1230 meters.<ref>Mapaure, Isaac (2012). \"Determinants of vegetation composition and diversity of a moist forest-savanna boundary in south-eastern Zimbabwe\". International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation Vol. 4(14), pp. 584-591, November, 2012</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Highlands are part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.\n\n==Climate==\nThe Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the  [[Zambezi River]], while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]].<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\".

The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, [[Chimanimani Mountains]], Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>\n\nThe highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.\n{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThe mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. \n\nLarge areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains. The Chimanimani park and reserve together form the core of the Chimanimani Transfrontier Conservation Area.\n\n==External Links==\n* [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006|Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic (terrestrial ecoregion)]\n* [https://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/563|Eastern Zimbabwe Highlands (freshwater ecoregion)]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|18.723|S|32.842|E|type:country|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Afromontane ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Afrotropic ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Great Rift Valley]]\n[[Category:Highlands]]\n[[Category:Montane grasslands and shrublands]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Physiographic divisions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|mountain range in Zimbabwe and Mozambique}}\n\n:''\"Eastern Highlands\" also refers to [[Eastern Highlands Province]] in Papua New Guinea, and part of the [[Great Dividing Range]], [[Australia]].''\n[[Image:Eastern higlands fromnyanga.jpg|thumb|300px|Northern part of the Eastern Highlands range as seen from Nyanga town.]]\n[[File:Eastern Highlands Nyanga.jpg|thumb|Eastern Highlands looking south towards Nyanga.]]\n[[File:Mt.

Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>\n\nThe highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.\n{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThe mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. \n\nLarge areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains. The Chimanimani park and reserve together form the core of the Chimanimani Transfrontier Conservation Area.\n\n==External Links==\n* [https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/at1006|Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic (terrestrial ecoregion)]\n* [https://www.feow.org/ecoregions/details/563|Eastern Zimbabwe Highlands (freshwater ecoregion)]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|18.723|S|32.842|E|type:country|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Afromontane ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Afrotropic ecoregions]]\n[[Category:Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Great Rift Valley]]\n[[Category:Highlands]]\n[[Category:Montane grasslands and shrublands]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Zimbabwe]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Physiographic divisions]]\n", "name_user": "Tom Radulovich", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGeography:link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Highlands"}
