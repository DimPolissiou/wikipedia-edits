{"title_page": "Uptown, Memphis", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=January 2011}}\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=October 2014}}\n}}\n\n'''Uptown Memphis''' is a neighborhood located near downtown [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]]. In 1999, the Uptown Partnership renamed the historic North Memphis Greenlaw neighborhood \"Uptown\" in concert with a public-private revitalization effort which defined Uptown as one hundred city blocks east of the Wolf River and North of A.W. Willis Avenue. The historic Greenlaw section of this neighborhood consists of the thirty city blocks closest to the Wolf River (this section is bordered by A.W. Willis Avenue to the south, North Seventh Street to the east, Keel Avenue and Chelsea Avenue to the north and the Wolf River to the west).\n\nAreas adjacent to Uptown include [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and the Pinch District.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1856, Greenlaw Addition was laid out by William B. Greenlaw, John O. Greenlaw, Robert F. Looney, John L. Saffarans, Isaac Saffarans and E.T. Keel.<ref>Keating, 1888</ref> These men owned the land north of Memphis across Bayou Gaoyoso from downtown. The Bayou was the original northern boundary of the City of Memphis.\n\nThe thirty block subdivision extended the grid patterns of downtown Memphis and included many desirable features of the time such as cobbled streets, granite curbs, and boulevards lined with sycamore trees. The names of the founders are familiar as the east-west streets honor them: Greenlaw, Saffarans, Looney, and Keel. Mill Street was appropriately named due to the mills that occupied the adjacent riverfront.\n\nThe namesakes of this new addition, the Greenlaw Brothers, arrived in Memphis during the early days of the city's growth where they built open-air markets in the downtown. The other partners in the project were prominent Memphis Businessmen in the 1850s: Robert Looney operated a dry goods store, John Saffarans owned a building supply company and sawmill and E.T. Keel owned grocery stores and property.<ref>Jemison, Dunaway & Kremer, 1979</ref> Many of the original Greenlaw residents were also prominent Memphis businessmen and citizens while the remaining residents were construction tradesmen <ref>Jemison et al., 1979</ref> \n\nBy the Civil War the area was prospering as remaining lots were being developed and businesses such as sawmills, brickyards and breweries were built on the banks of the Wolf River. In 1870, Greenlaw and Chelsea were annexed into Memphis.\n\nOnce Memphis recovered from the devastating effects of the Civil War, Greenlaw witnessed a major commercial and residential development <ref>Jemison et al., 1979</ref>. Small neighborhood businesses concentrated along North Second Street as the area west of North Main became more industrial <ref>Jemison et al., 1979 </ref>. Residences included a mix of larger homes on prominent corner locations, smaller duplexes on the inside blocks and shotgun style homes on the alleyways and near the bayou. Originally named High Street, Seventh Street was the prime location for expensive homes due to its topographical advantage. Seventh Street follows the line of a Native American Trail running north and until 1867 it was the only bridge crossing Bayou Gayoso <ref>Griffin, 2001 </ref>. George Love, a former Mayor of Memphis, built a grand home on North Seventh Street in 1888, which is currently the city's Non-Profit Housing Center. Mr. Love also built investment properties to include four \"Love cottages\" on North Sixth Street in 1890 that have been recently renovated by Memphis Heritage, a preservation nonprofit <ref>Davis, 2012 </ref>.\n\nIn its prosperous years, Greenlaw was inhabited by an ethnically and economically diverse population. First generation Irish, German, Jew and Italian immigrants and second generation Americans from the North and Midwest settled in the neighborhood.<ref>Jemison et al., 1979 </ref> By 1890, Greenlaw had a large African American population to include owners of neighborhood businesses and professionals living and working in the community.<ref>Jemison et al., 1979</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nThe 1912 Mississippi River Flood had a major impact on the Greenlaw neighborhood. It was at the epicenter of the flooding as indicated by four feet deep floodwaters at North Second Street and Mill Street <ref>Friends for our Riverfront, 2014 </ref>; 1,200 people fled as floods damaged over 714 homes and 25 manufacturing plants. \n\nGayoso Pumping station was built by the city in 1912 to prevent a recurrence but in 1913 the levee collapsed displacing over 1,000 families and covering twenty city block with water <ref> Williams, 2008 </ref>. The Flood Control Act of 1917 proposed more additional levee construction but changes were no enacted until the 1930s as New Deal Construction projects to include permanent concrete box culverts, chamber, and pump stations <ref>Williams, 2008 </ref>. \n\nBy the 1920s, many prominent and politically powerful families such as the Walshes, Loves and Guthries had moved out of the neighborhood. This population shift affected the city's support for the neighborhood; the Wolf River Bridge at the north end of Second Street was washed out in the 1930s and was never replaced. With the rapidly evaporating wealthy population, Greenlaw lost its political clout and its sense of being a \"special\" neighborhood <ref>Jemison et al., 1979</ref>. Large homes were sold and often redesigned for more cost effective options such as apartments, rooming houses or business uses. Newly constructed homes were modest, designed to attract blue collar workers who would find the neighborhood convenient and affordable <ref>Jemison et al., 1979</ref>. \n\nWith favorable geography and low property values, Greenlaw was a location of great industrial growth during World War II. By 1945, Philip Belz had built plants in North Memphis for General Motors, Bemis Bag, General Electric, Kroger, U.S. Rubber, and National Biscuit <ref>Jemison et al., 1979 </ref>. The neighborhood attracted [[blue-collar]] workers and African Americans. Bars, liquor stores and juke joints also opened up, tarnishing the family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nIn an effort to attract more white residents, the Memphis Housing Authority built an all-white housing development called Hurt Village in the 1950s.\n\nRacial tensions were at a high in the 1960s due to the sanitation strike and [[assassination of Martin Luther King]].  Most whites who lived in Hurt Village left the area. Since then, most businesses have closed as well as industries. Non-profit groups seek ways to assist the mainly African-American residents left in the area.\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2000, Memphis was awarded the Hope VI grant for demolition of Hurt Village. Uptown is currently becoming a mixed community that is rich in culture and people.\n''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' took place here.\n\n==Notable residents==\nAt one time, [[Elvis Presley]] lived in Lauderdale Courts, a small government housing project in this area which has since been renovated into a nicer apartment complex. [[Michael Oher]], a player in the NFL, spent most of his childhood growing up in Uptown Memphis, until the Tuohy family took him in.\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Uptown Memphis, Tennessee|Uptown Memphis}}\n<references/>\nDavis, Chris.

By the 1950s, the Seminaire de Rimouski had begun offering postsecondary level courses in partnership with [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seminairerimouski.com/index_histoire.html|title=Index, Histoire du S\u00e9minaire de Rimouski, des origines (1863) \u00e0 l'ouverture du C\u00e9gep (1968)|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> Following the onset of the [[Quiet Revolution]] in Qu\u00e9bec, postsecondary access expanded in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. The Parent Commission report established that Qu\u00e9bec's citizens were entitled to full educational opportunities at all levels.<ref name=\"mccord-museum.qc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/scripts/explore.php?Lang=1&tablename=theme&tableid=11&elementid=107__true&contentlong|title=Education in Qu\u00e9bec, before and after the Parent reform - Thematic Tours - Mus\u00e9e McCord Museum|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> Implementing the report's recommendations necessitated [[Secularization|secularizing]] the province's educational system, which had largely been run by religious organizations.<ref name=\"mccord-museum.qc.ca\" /> An act creating the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec was passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec|provincial legislative assembly]] in 1968. One year later, the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski opened on the grounds of the former monastery of the [[Ursulines of Quebec]].\n\n====2009 fire====\nDuring the night of May 14, 2009, at approximately 1:30, the [[fire alarm system]] was triggered and reported by the on-duty Rimouski campus security agent while at the same time smoke was spotted by patrolmen from the [[S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]] passing by. The fire resulted in a general alarm for the Rimouski fire department, prompting assistance from the fire departments of [[Le bic|Bic]] and [[Saint-Anaclet-de-Lessard, Quebec|St-Anaclet]]. By mid-day, the fire was contained and mostly put out. It resulted in the destruction of the main wing's [[Bell tower|belfry]] as well as major fire damage to the roof and water damage to the floors below.\n\nThe affected wing houses procurement and printing services, student's services, the student's bookstore, the [[Rector (academia)#Canada|rector]]'s and vice-rectors offices, finances and human resources as well as classes and working spaces of graduate students. The university's geography department uses the classes located on the 5th floor, directly under the fire-damaged part of the building, and the offices located directly under the collapsed belfry are occupied by researchers. Many graduate students are also working on the 5th floor.\n\nThe damage was estimated at the time at least $3 million.<ref>[http://www.uqar.qc.ca/uqar-info/0509/incendie_mai.asp Un incendie est survenu sur le toit de l'UQAR].

The fire resulted in a general alarm for the Rimouski fire department, prompting assistance from the fire departments of [[Le bic|Bic]] and [[Saint-Anaclet-de-Lessard, Quebec|St-Anaclet]]. By mid-day, the fire was contained and mostly put out. It resulted in the destruction of the main wing's [[Bell tower|belfry]] as well as major fire damage to the roof and water damage to the floors below.\n\nThe affected wing houses procurement and printing services, student's services, the student's bookstore, the [[Rector (academia)#Canada|rector]]'s and vice-rectors offices, finances and human resources as well as classes and working spaces of graduate students. The university's geography department uses the classes located on the 5th floor, directly under the fire-damaged part of the building, and the offices located directly under the collapsed belfry are occupied by researchers. Many graduate students are also working on the 5th floor.\n\nThe damage was estimated at the time at least $3 million.<ref>[http://www.uqar.qc.ca/uqar-info/0509/incendie_mai.asp Un incendie est survenu sur le toit de l'UQAR].

===\nFrom its beginning, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski has been at the forefront of the study and understanding of the marine environment.\n\nThe recognition of marine sciences as an area of excellence has enabled UQAR to develop a sizeable research capacity in the field. Today, UQAR has brought together a remarkably strong group of researchers, whose expertise touch on a vast array of questions in the field of marine sciences.\n\nThe Institut des sciences de la mer de Rimouski enjoys international recognition as the flagship of Quebec research in this field.\n\nUQAR has cutting-edge infrastructure that offers researchers unique research potential. Over the past decade, more than $50M have been invested in infrastructure, including equipment, to support the marine science sector in the Rimouski region, in particular at UQAR-ISMER<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ismer.ca/|title=Institut des sciences de la mer de Rimouski|website=Institut des sciences de la mer de Rimouski|language=fr-ca|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>.\n\nUQAR has a variety of research tools that allow it to position itself as a world leader in the vast field of marine science. In addition to high-performance oceanography instruments and laboratories equipped with the latest technologies, ISMER researchers enjoy two major infrastructures: an oceanography research vessel and an aquaculture station.\n<br />\n\n=== Regional development<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uqar.ca/a-propos/langues/english/research/regional-development|title=Regional development|last=Cormier|first=Francois|website=www.uqar.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> ===\nQAR\u2019s expertise in regional development is anything but a random process. It is the result of a long tradition of reflection and research that goes back several decades. At the beginning of the Quiet Revolution in the 1960s, the Quebec and Canadian governments identified the Lower St. Lawrence and Gasp\u00e9sie regions as future laboratories for social experimentation in the area of regional development.\n\nUQAR is looking to better grasp the issues and problems facing regions in connection with current economic and societal changes. Researchers associated with this line of research analyze socioterritorial dynamics affecting regions and create tools for development assistance.\n\nRegional development is a primary institutional focus in both basic and applied research, with a number of organized research units.

Of the 10 initial submissions, they were granted 8 Equipex facilities: BEDOFIH, D-FIH, Equip@Meso, ICGex, IPGG, Paris-en-Resonnance, Planaqua, Ultrabrain. These projects received funding in amounts ranging from \u20ac2 to \u20ac10 million. \n\nIn 2017, after a detailed process of consideration, 9 institutions agreed to set up an integrated budget and a multi-year strategy for academic recruitment, as well as to create a number of shared platforms and services.
