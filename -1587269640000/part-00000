It was the United States' fourth-largest [[media conglomerate]] until [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|its acquisition]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2019. The other company, the [[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|present-day News Corporation]], holds Murdoch's [[newspaper|print]] interests and other media assets in Australia (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39% interest in each). Murdoch was co-executive chairman, while his sons [[Lachlan Murdoch]] and [[James Murdoch]] were co-executive chairman and CEO, respectively.\n\n21st Century Fox's assets included the [[Fox Entertainment Group]]\u2014owners of the [[20th Century Fox]] film studio (the company's partial namesake), the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network,  and a majority stake in [[National Geographic Partners]]\u2014the commercial media arm of the [[National Geographic Society]], among other assets.

It was the United States' fourth-largest [[media conglomerate]] until [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|its acquisition]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2019. The other company, the [[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|present-day News Corporation]], holds Murdoch's [[newspaper|print]] interests and other media assets in Australia (both owned by him and his family via a family trust with 39% interest in each). Murdoch was co-executive chairman, while his sons [[Lachlan Murdoch]] and [[James Murdoch]] were co-executive chairman and CEO, respectively.\n\n21st Century Fox's assets included the [[Fox Entertainment Group]]\u2014owners of the [[20th Century Fox]] film studio (the company's partial namesake), the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television network,  and a majority stake in [[National Geographic Partners]]\u2014the commercial media arm of the [[National Geographic Society]], among other assets.

It was first released on their 1972 album ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. In 2004, the song was ranked number 434 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|the 500 greatest songs of all time]],<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> ranked number 4 in ''[[Total Guitar]]'' magazine's Greatest Guitar Riffs Ever,<ref name=\"BBC\"/> and in March 2005, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] placed \"Smoke on the Water\" at number 12 in its list of the 100 greatest guitar tracks.<ref name=\"QMagazine\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Smoke on the Water riff.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Smoke on the Water'' riff]] \"Smoke on the Water\" is easily identified by its central theme, developed by guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]]. It is a four-note [[blues scale]] melody in [[G minor]], harmonised in parallel fourths. The [[riff]], played on a [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]] by Blackmore, is later joined by hi-hat and distorted organ, then the rest of the [[Drum kit|drums]], then [[bass guitar|electric bass]] parts before the start of [[Ian Gillan]]'s vocal.\n\nBlackmore later claimed that the main power chord riff is an interpretation of inversion of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and that \"I owe him a lot of money\".<ref name=\"Thompson2004\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzzCw6xs9roC|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-618-8|page=128}}</ref>.  However, it is strikingly similar to the track \"Loose\" from [[The Stooges]] 1970 album ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', released the year before Smoke on the Water was written.  The guitar riffs from both songs also closely resemble a piano riff, played by [[Gil Evans]], from the 1966 [[Astrud Gilberto]] record \"Maria Quiet\"<ref>[http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/33884/Deep%20Purple-Smoke%20on%20the%20Water_Astrud%20Gilberto%20and%20Gil%20Evans-Maria%20Quiet%20(Maria%20Moite)/ Deep Purple's Smoke on the Water sample of Astrud Gilberto and Gil Evans's Maria Quiet (Maria Moite).

Blackmore played the intro on the 3rd and 5th fret of a [[Sunburst (finish)|3 tone sunburst]] [[Fender Stratocaster]], often turning his back to the camera or the audience. Later on, he can be seen using his thumb top-down on the E and A strings on 8th and 10th fret, as follows:\n\n<pre style=\"display:inline-block\">-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n------8-10-----8-11-10--------8-10--8------\n---10-8-10--10-8-11-10-----10-8-10--8-10---\n---10-------10-------------10---------10---</pre>\n\nThere are two solos in the song; the first was performed on guitar by Ritchie Blackmore, and the second was performed on an organ by Jon Lord until the song fades out.\n\n==History==\n{{quote box|width=27%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|align=right|quote=We all came out to Montreux,<br />\nOn the Lake Geneva shoreline.<br />To make records with a mobile,<br />We didn't have much time.<br />Frank Zappa and the Mothers,<br />Were at the best place around.<br />But some stupid with a flare gun,<br />Burned the place to the ground.<br />Smoke on the water, fire in the sky.|source=\u2014Opening verse and chorus of \"Smoke on the Water\", recollecting the fire.}}\nThe lyrics tell a true story: On 4 December 1971, Deep Purple were in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], to record an album using a mobile recording studio (rented from [[the Rolling Stones]] and known as the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]\u2014referred to as the \"Rolling truck Stones thing\" and \"a mobile\" in the lyrics) at the entertainment complex that was part of the [[Montreux Casino]] (referred to as \"the gambling house\" in the song lyric). On the eve of the recording session, a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] concert was held in the casino's theatre. This was to be the theatre's final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of [[Don Preston]]'s synthesizer solo on \"King Kong\", the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a [[flare gun]] toward the [[rattan]] covered ceiling, as mentioned in the \"some stupid with a flare gun\" line.<ref>''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso, pg. 112, {{ISBN|0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, page 26, {{ISBN|0-609-80732-3}}</ref> Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The \"smoke on the water\" that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist [[Roger Glover]], who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over [[Lake Geneva]] from the burning [[Montreux Casino|casino]] as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. \"It was probably the biggest fire I'd ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life\" said Glover. \"It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn't seem like much of a fire at first. But, when it caught, it went up like a fireworks display.\" The \"Funky Claude\" running in and out is referring to [[Claude Nobs]], the director of the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] who helped some of the audience escape the fire.<ref name=obit>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs, Montreux Jazz Festival founder, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20981739|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Claude Nobs1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Claude Nobs]] (2006), the \"Funky Claude\" mentioned in the song]]\nLeft with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named \"Title No.1\"), before local police shut them down.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty [[H\u00f4tel des Alpes-Grand H\u00f4tel|Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet]] and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu o\u00f9 est n\u00e9 \u00abSmoke on the Water\u00bb |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC. Retrieved 19 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe only song from ''Machine Head'' not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was \"Smoke on the Water\" itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover's title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d/>\n\nBecause of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when \"Smoke on the Water\" became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song is honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]]) with the band's name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall.\n\nOn the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode about ''Machine Head'', [[Ritchie Blackmore]] claimed friends of the band were not fans of the \"Smoke on the Water\" riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], which revolves around a similar four note arrangement.\n\n\"The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie's riff in particular,\" observed [[Ian Paice]], \"is that somebody hadn't done it before, because it's so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=To Infinity\u2026 and Beyond?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #234|date=April 2017|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\"Smoke on the Water\" was included on ''Machine Head'', which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (\"[[Never Before (song)|Never Before]]\" and \"[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]\" were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, and it propelled the album to the top 10. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore's guitar and [[Jon Lord]]'s [[Hammond organ]] would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple's live shows, and a version of the song from the live album ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]'' became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.\n\nThe principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist [[Bernie Torme]]. This song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore's post-Deep Purple band [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] during their tours 1981\u201383, and again after Rainbow was resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.\n\nDuring Ian Gillan's stint with [[Black Sabbath]] in 1983, they performed \"Smoke on the Water\" as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath has ever played live.\n\nThe song is popular amongst beginner guitarists, but Blackmore himself has demonstrated that most who attempt to play it do so improperly.

It is a four-note [[blues scale]] melody in [[G minor]], harmonised in parallel fourths. The [[riff]], played on a [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]] by Blackmore, is later joined by hi-hat and distorted organ, then the rest of the [[Drum kit|drums]], then [[bass guitar|electric bass]] parts before the start of [[Ian Gillan]]'s vocal.

However, it is strikingly similar to the track \"Loose\" from [[The Stooges]] 1970 album ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', released the year before Smoke on the Water was written.

On the eve of the recording session, a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] concert was held in the casino's theatre. This was to be the theatre's final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of [[Don Preston]]'s synthesizer solo on \"King Kong\", the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a [[flare gun]] toward the [[rattan]] covered ceiling, as mentioned in the \"some stupid with a flare gun\" line.<ref>''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso, pg. 112, {{ISBN|0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, page 26, {{ISBN|0-609-80732-3}}</ref> Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The \"smoke on the water\" that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist [[Roger Glover]], who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over [[Lake Geneva]] from the burning [[Montreux Casino|casino]] as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. \"It was probably the biggest fire I'd ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life\" said Glover. \"It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn't seem like much of a fire at first. But, when it caught, it went up like a fireworks display.\" The \"Funky Claude\" running in and out is referring to [[Claude Nobs]], the director of the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] who helped some of the audience escape the fire.<ref name=obit>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs, Montreux Jazz Festival founder, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20981739|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Claude Nobs1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Claude Nobs]] (2006), the \"Funky Claude\" mentioned in the song]]\nLeft with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named \"Title No.1\"), before local police shut them down.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty [[H\u00f4tel des Alpes-Grand H\u00f4tel|Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet]] and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu o\u00f9 est n\u00e9 \u00abSmoke on the Water\u00bb |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC. Retrieved 19 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe only song from ''Machine Head'' not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was \"Smoke on the Water\" itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover's title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d/>\n\nBecause of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when \"Smoke on the Water\" became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song is honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]]) with the band's name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall.\n\nOn the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode about ''Machine Head'', [[Ritchie Blackmore]] claimed friends of the band were not fans of the \"Smoke on the Water\" riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], which revolves around a similar four note arrangement.\n\n\"The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie's riff in particular,\" observed [[Ian Paice]], \"is that somebody hadn't done it before, because it's so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=To Infinity\u2026 and Beyond?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #234|date=April 2017|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\"Smoke on the Water\" was included on ''Machine Head'', which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (\"[[Never Before (song)|Never Before]]\" and \"[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]\" were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, and it propelled the album to the top 10. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore's guitar and [[Jon Lord]]'s [[Hammond organ]] would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple's live shows, and a version of the song from the live album ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]'' became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.\n\nThe principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist [[Bernie Torme]]. This song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore's post-Deep Purple band [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] during their tours 1981\u201383, and again after Rainbow was resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.\n\nDuring Ian Gillan's stint with [[Black Sabbath]] in 1983, they performed \"Smoke on the Water\" as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath has ever played live.\n\nThe song is popular amongst beginner guitarists, but Blackmore himself has demonstrated that most who attempt to play it do so improperly. Actually played using \"[[all fourths]]\" (or [[double stops]]) as specified by Blackmore, a [[power chord]]-driven variation on the main recognizable riff is not difficult, and is consequently often played by learners.\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" has received the following rankings:\n* 434 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] (2004)<ref name=\"RollingStone\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Deep Purple, 'Smoke on the Water'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703000445/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 |date=3 July 2012}} Rolling Stone.
