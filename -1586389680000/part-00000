{"title_page": "Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''Quartet''''' is [[Jean Rhys]]'s 1928 debut novel, set in Paris's bohemian [[caf\u00e9 society]]. Originally published by [[Chatto & Windus|Chatto and Windus]], ''Quartet'' was Rhys's first published book other than her short story collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'' (1927).\n\nIn the UK ''Quartet'' was released under the publisher's preferred title ''Postures'' which Rhys disliked. After it was well received in the US as ''Quartet'' (1929) Rhys had later UK editions re-titled to her original choice of ''Quartet'', which alludes to four central characters comprising two couples.\n\nLike various Jean Rhys novels, ''Quartet'' is autobiographical fiction. It is a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' based on her extramarital affair and acrimonious break up with her literary mentor [[Ford Madox Ford]], the English author and editor of ''[[The Transatlantic Review]]'' literary magazine.The affair occurred in Ford's Paris home under the eye of his common-law wife, Australian artist [[Stella Bowen]], while Rhys's husband Jean Lenglet was in jail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiesenfarth|first=Joseph|date=2016|title=\"Quartet\" With Variation: Ford Madox Ford, Stella Bowen, Jean Rhys, Jean Lenglet|journal=International Ford Madox Ford Studies|volume=15|pages=175\u2013187|jstor=44871879|issn=1569-4070}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Angier, Carole|title=Jean Rhys : life and work|date=February 2011|isbn=978-0-571-27641-7|location=London|oclc=727028081}}</ref><ref name=pizz2020>{{Cite book|author=Pizzichini, Lilian|title=The blue hour : a life of Jean Rhys|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

Reliant on Stephan as provider, Marya seldom questions his dealings. They live hand-to-mouth as his deal takes shape. When Stephan is charged with selling stolen artwork and sentenced to a year's jail Marya, stranded and alone in a foreign city, is destitute. At Stephan's urging from jail she moves in with avuncular Englishman H. J. Heidler and his painter wife Lois, who she knows socially. There she discovers Heidler's history of inviting young women to lodge in his spare room, initiating affairs with them as Lois turns a blind eye. When Marya visits Stephan in jail, Heidler and Lois object and discourage her from seeing him. Isolated under his roof and dependent on his charity, Marya succumbs to Heidler's advances. With Marya at their mercy, Heidler and Lois escort her around their social haunts in a charade of respectability, deflecting suspicion and gossip about the ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois''. Obliged to comply, Marya suspects people guess the truth regardless. Tension mounts between Marya and Lois, which Heidler ignores. Released from jail, the once self-assured Stephan is broken and Marya guilt-ridden. Heidler pushes Marya to choose between himself and Stephan, while refusing to forfeit his own marriage to Lois. Torn, Marya pities Stephan, which he resents. As her affair with Heidler breaks down, Stephan bolts leaving Marya's fate in the hands of Heidler and Lois.\n\n== Background ==\nRhys and her first of three husbands Jean Lenglet, a multilingual Dutch journalist and [[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau|French Intelligence Service]] spy, met in London in 1917.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Williams, Ella Gwendolen Rees (1890?\u20131979)|date=2018-02-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.31833|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref>  After [[World War I]] they roamed Europe, marrying in [[The Hague]] in 1919. They moved between [[Amsterdam]], [[Belgium]], [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]] where, from 1920, Lenglet was a secretary-interpreter with the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]]'s Japanese delegation, which monitored [[disarmament]] in [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rhys, Jean.|title=Smile please : an unfinished autobiography|date=1981|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-018405-8|location=London|oclc=34080068}}</ref> When the job transferred him to [[Budapest]], Lenglet was caught using Commission money for [[Speculation|currency speculation]]. When he failed to repay the money on time, he and Rhys absconded back to Paris, with the Inter-Allied Commission on his trail. French solicitors meanwhile pursued Lenglet over a previous undissolved marriage (Rhys being the third of his five wives). In Paris on 28 December 1924 Lenglet was arrested, accused by his new employer, American travel agency Exprinter, of embezzling 23,421 francs. He denied the charge, claiming the company had given him the money for a transaction, but his defence was dismissed and on 10 February 1925 he was sentenced to eight months at [[Fresnes Prison]].<ref name=pizz2020 />\n\nThis left Rhys destitute and panic-stricken. With Lenglet's agreement from jail, Rhys allowed herself to be taken in by Ford Madox Ford and Stella Bowen. She had met the couple in 1924 when, penniless with Lenglet working away as a journalist, she tried selling some of his articles through Mrs H Pearl Adam, a well connected British [[expatriate]] she met a tea party.<ref name=adam2020>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb106-7hpa|title=Papers of H Pearl Adam - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Wife of wartime ''[[The Times]]'' correspondent George Adam and daughter of ''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]'' columnist [[C.

Seeing literary potential, Mrs Adam allowed Rhys to live with her while helping edit and divide the diary into stories, then sent Jean to Ford Madox Ford, who helped new writers.<ref name=adam2020 />\n\nFord mentored Rhys, published her first short story ''Vienne in [[The Transatlantic Review]]'' and introduced her to other contributors''.''<ref name=frick1990>{{Cite book|title=Critical perspectives on Jean Rhys|date=1990|publisher=Three Continents Press|others=Frickey, Pierrette M.|isbn=0-89410-059-9|edition=1st|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=21600877}}</ref> At Ford and Stella's parties she met people like [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Gertrude Stein#Alice B. Toklas|Alice B. Toklas]] and painter [[Nina Hamnett]].\n\nUnder Ford and Bowen's roof, with Lenglet in jail, an affair developed between Jean Rhys and Ford, which Stella Bowen initially tolerated. She asked Rhys to pose for paintings, gave her clothes and confided in her, outwardly befriending her but silently disapproving.<ref name=bowen2020>{{Cite book|last=Bowen, Stella.|title=Drawn from life : a memoir|date=1999|publisher=Picador|isbn=0-330-36164-3|location=Sydney [Australia]|oclc=47706613}}</ref> Presenting a respectable front, the couple took Rhys to [[Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9]] and other intellectual gathering spots on the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse|Boulevarde du Montparnasse]], showing her off as Ford's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 while rivalry grew between Stella and Jean, and tension formed between Stella and Ford. The trio's nonchalant fa\u00e7ade was what ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s earlier title ''Postures'' alluded to.\n\nBy the time of Lenglet's prison release the Ford affair was unhidden and Lenglet felt betrayed. Soon after, due to his French criminal record Lenglet was expelled, returning to his native Holland without Rhys.\n\nFord and Stella sent Jean to [[Juan-les-Pins]], finding her a live-in job ghostwriting a book on reincarnation and interior design for [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s mother-in-law Winifred, second wife of American cosmetics millionaire [[Richard Hudnut]].\n\nWith that, the 'quartet' after which the novel is named was dissolved.\n\nJean Rhys revisited her relationships with Lenglet and Ford but neither lasted. Ford and Stella separated in 1927 after nine years together. Rhys and Lenglet remained intermittently estranged, formally separating in 1928 and divorcing in 1933. The pair remained close friends, bound by their daughter Maryvonne Lenglet, who was three and in care at the time of her father's imprisonment but later became his custodian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/genealogie_mostert/I63411.php|title=MARYVONNE LENGLET (1922-2000) \u00bb Genealogie Mostert \u00bb Genealogy Online|last=Mostert|first=S.

Originally published by [[Chatto & Windus|Chatto and Windus]], ''Quartet'' was Rhys's first published book other than her short story collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'' (1927).\n\nIn the UK ''Quartet'' was released under the publisher's preferred title ''Postures'' which Rhys disliked. After it was well received in the US as ''Quartet'' (1929) Rhys had later UK editions re-titled to her original choice of ''Quartet'', which alludes to four central characters comprising two couples.\n\nLike various Jean Rhys novels, ''Quartet'' is autobiographical fiction. It is a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' based on her extramarital affair and acrimonious break up with her literary mentor [[Ford Madox Ford]], the English author and editor of ''[[The Transatlantic Review]]'' literary magazine.The affair occurred in Ford's Paris home under the eye of his common-law wife, Australian artist [[Stella Bowen]], while Rhys's husband Jean Lenglet was in jail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiesenfarth|first=Joseph|date=2016|title=\"Quartet\" With Variation: Ford Madox Ford, Stella Bowen, Jean Rhys, Jean Lenglet|journal=International Ford Madox Ford Studies|volume=15|pages=175\u2013187|jstor=44871879|issn=1569-4070}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Angier, Carole|title=Jean Rhys : life and work|date=February 2011|isbn=978-0-571-27641-7|location=London|oclc=727028081}}</ref><ref name=pizz2020>{{Cite book|author=Pizzichini, Lilian|title=The blue hour : a life of Jean Rhys|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

Reliant on Stephan as provider, Marya seldom questions his dealings. They live hand-to-mouth as his deal takes shape. When Stephan is charged with selling stolen artwork and sentenced to a year's jail Marya, stranded and alone in a foreign city, is destitute. At Stephan's urging from jail she moves in with avuncular Englishman H. J. Heidler and his painter wife Lois, who she knows socially. There she discovers Heidler's history of inviting young women to lodge in his spare room, initiating affairs with them as Lois turns a blind eye. When Marya visits Stephan in jail, Heidler and Lois object and discourage her from seeing him. Isolated under his roof and dependent on his charity, Marya succumbs to Heidler's advances. With Marya at their mercy, Heidler and Lois escort her around their social haunts in a charade of respectability, deflecting suspicion and gossip about the ''m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois''. Obliged to comply, Marya suspects people guess the truth regardless. Tension mounts between Marya and Lois, which Heidler ignores. Released from jail, the once self-assured Stephan is broken and Marya guilt-ridden. Heidler pushes Marya to choose between himself and Stephan, while refusing to forfeit his own marriage to Lois. Torn, Marya pities Stephan, which he resents. As her affair with Heidler breaks down, Stephan bolts leaving Marya's fate in the hands of Heidler and Lois.\n\n== Background ==\nRhys and her first of three husbands Jean Lenglet, a multilingual Dutch journalist and [[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau|French Intelligence Service]] spy, met in London in 1917.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Williams, Ella Gwendolen Rees (1890?\u20131979)|date=2018-02-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.31833|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref>  After [[World War I]] they roamed Europe, marrying in [[The Hague]] in 1919. They moved between [[Amsterdam]], [[Belgium]], [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]] where, from 1920, Lenglet was a secretary-interpreter with the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]]'s Japanese delegation, which monitored [[disarmament]] in [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rhys, Jean.|title=Smile please : an unfinished autobiography|date=1981|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-018405-8|location=London|oclc=34080068}}</ref> When the job transferred him to [[Budapest]], Lenglet was caught using Commission money for [[Speculation|currency speculation]]. When he failed to repay the money on time, he and Rhys absconded back to Paris, with the Inter-Allied Commission on his trail. French solicitors meanwhile pursued Lenglet over a previous undissolved marriage (Rhys being the third of his five wives). In Paris on 28 December 1924 Lenglet was arrested, accused by his new employer, American travel agency Exprinter, of embezzling 23,421 francs. He denied the charge, claiming the company had given him the money for a transaction, but his defence was dismissed and on 10 February 1925 he was sentenced to eight months at [[Fresnes Prison]].<ref name=pizz2020 />\n\nThis left Rhys destitute and panic-stricken. With Lenglet's agreement from jail, Rhys allowed herself to be taken in by Ford Madox Ford and Stella Bowen. She had met the couple in 1924 when, penniless with Lenglet working away as a journalist, she tried selling some of his articles through Mrs H Pearl Adam, a well connected British [[expatriate]] she met a tea party.<ref name=adam2020>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb106-7hpa|title=Papers of H Pearl Adam - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Wife of wartime ''[[The Times]]'' correspondent George Adam and daughter of ''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]'' columnist [[C.

Seeing literary potential, Mrs Adam allowed Rhys to live with her while helping edit and divide the diary into stories, then sent Jean to Ford Madox Ford, who helped new writers.<ref name=adam2020 />\n\nFord mentored Rhys, published her first short story ''Vienne in [[The Transatlantic Review]]'' and introduced her to other contributors''.''<ref name=frick1990>{{Cite book|title=Critical perspectives on Jean Rhys|date=1990|publisher=Three Continents Press|others=Frickey, Pierrette M.|isbn=0-89410-059-9|edition=1st|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=21600877}}</ref> At Ford and Stella's parties she met people like [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Gertrude Stein#Alice%20B.%20Toklas|Alice B.

The trio's nonchalant fa\u00e7ade was what ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s earlier title ''Postures'' alluded to.\n\nBy the time of Lenglet's prison release the Ford affair was unhidden and Lenglet felt betrayed. Soon after, due to his French criminal record Lenglet was expelled, returning to his native Holland without Rhys.\n\nFord and Stella sent Jean to [[Juan-les-Pins]], finding her a live-in job ghostwriting a book on reincarnation and interior design for [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s mother-in-law Winifred, second wife of American cosmetics millionaire [[Richard Hudnut]].\n\nWith that, the 'quartet' after which the novel is named was dissolved.\n\nJean Rhys revisited her relationships with Lenglet and Ford but neither lasted. Ford and Stella separated in 1927 after nine years together. Rhys and Lenglet remained intermittently estranged, formally separating in 1928 and divorcing in 1933. The pair remained close friends, bound by their daughter Maryvonne Lenglet, who was three and in care at the time of her father's imprisonment but later became his custodian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/genealogie_mostert/I63411.php|title=MARYVONNE LENGLET (1922-2000) \u00bb Genealogie Mostert \u00bb Genealogy Online|last=Mostert|first=S.

After the death of his wife, King Gongmin even went so far as to create a ministry whose sole purpose was to seek out and recruit young men from all over the country to serve in his court. Others including [[Chungseon of Goryeo|King Chungseon]] had long-term relationships with men.

During this period, there were travelling theater groups known as ''[[namsadang]]'' which included underaged males called ''midong'' (\"beautiful boys\"). The troupes provided \"various types of entertainment, including band music, song, masked dance, circus, and puppet plays,\" sometimes with graphic representations of same-sex intercourse.

Within the army branch of the German ''Wehrmacht'', a rank of ''[[Obersch\u00fctze]]'' (senior rifleman) once existed between the ranks of ''Gefreiter'' and ''[[Sch\u00fctze]]/Soldat'' (\"[enlisted] ordinary-rank rifleman/soldier\"). In modern times the ''Unteroffizier'' rank is now considered in English the equivalent to a [[sergeant]] and less a corporal rank, under the [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO rank scale]] OR-5.\n\n====Bohemian corporal====\nThe best-known holder of the rank of ''Gefreiter'' was [[Adolf Hitler]], who held the rank in the [[6th Bavarian Reserve Division|Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16]] of the Royal [[Bavarian Army]] during [[World War I]].\n\n''Bohemian corporal'' was a derogatory term used (privately) in World War II for [[Adolf Hitler]] by German generals dissatisfied with Hitler\u2019s military leadership and detailed control, e.g.  [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], [[Erich von Manstein]] and [[Friedrich Paulus]]; many of the generals were Prussian aristocrats (''von''). [[Wilhelm Keitel]] once said to Hitler ''Do you realise that Rundsted called you a Bohemian corporal'' who replied ''Yes, but he\u2019s the best field marshall I have''. Von Rundsted used the term ''Dieser b\u00f6hmische Gefreiter'' which he got in the 1930s from World War I hero Chancellor [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. Von Hindenburg (he and Hitler took an instant dislike to each other on first meeting) mistook Hitler\u2019s home town of Braunau in Austria ([[Braunau am Inn]]) for another town of the same name ([[Broumov]]; \"Branau\" in German) in Bohemia; initially he said that ''Austrian corporal'' but later used ''Bohemian corporal''; a perjorative term as he regarded Bohemians as ''essentially gypsies'' unlike the more cultured Prussians or even Austrians.<ref>{{cite book |last=  Margaritis |first= Peter |title= Countdown to D-Day: The German perspective |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2019 |publisher= Casemate |location= Oxford, UK & PA, USA |isbn= 978-1-61200-769-4 |oclc= |page=xv |pages=  }} </ref>  \n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n!

Within the army branch of the German ''Wehrmacht'', a rank of ''[[Obersch\u00fctze]]'' (senior rifleman) once existed between the ranks of ''Gefreiter'' and ''[[Sch\u00fctze]]/Soldat'' (\"[enlisted] ordinary-rank rifleman/soldier\"). In modern times the ''Unteroffizier'' rank is now considered in English the equivalent to a [[sergeant]] and less a corporal rank, under the [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO rank scale]] OR-5.\n\n====Bohemian corporal====\nThe best-known holder of the rank of ''Gefreiter'' was [[Adolf Hitler]], who held the rank in the [[6th Bavarian Reserve Division|Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16]] of the Royal [[Bavarian Army]] during [[World War I]].\n\n''Bohemian corporal'' was a derogatory term used (privately) in World War II for [[Adolf Hitler]] by German generals dissatisfied with Hitler\u2019s military leadership and detailed control, e.g.  [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], [[Erich von Manstein]] and [[Friedrich Paulus]]. Many of the generals were Prussian aristocrats (''von''); [[Wilhelm Keitel]] once said to Hitler ''Do you realise that Rundsted called you a Bohemian corporal'' who replied ''Yes, but he\u2019s the best field marshall I have''. Von Rundsted used the term ''Dieser b\u00f6hmische Gefreiter'' which he got in the 1930s from World War I hero Chancellor [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. Von Hindenburg (he and Hitler took an instant dislike to each other on first meeting) mistook Hitler\u2019s home town of Braunau in Austria ([[Braunau am Inn]]) for another town of the same name ([[Broumov]]; \"Branau\" in German) in Bohemia; initially he said that ''Austrian corporal'' but later used ''Bohemian corporal''; a perjorative term as he regarded Bohemians as ''essentially gypsies'' unlike the more cultured Prussians or even Austrians.<ref>{{cite book |last=  Margaritis |first= Peter |title= Countdown to D-Day: The German perspective |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2019 |publisher= Casemate |location= Oxford, UK & PA, USA |isbn= 978-1-61200-769-4 |oclc= |page=xv |pages=  }} </ref>  \n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n!

Raja]] to get DB Realty promoter [[Shahid Balwa]] to circuitously route 2 billion (US$36.2 million) to Kalaignar TV. According to CBI, Kanimozhi was in regular touch with A. Raja regarding launching of Kalaignar TV channel and its other pending works. CBI alleges that A. Raja was further pursuing the cause of Kalaignar TV not only for getting registration of the company from Ministry of Information and Broadcasting but also for getting it in the DTH operator TATA Sky's bouquet. She was also summoned by the Income Tax Department, Chennai for alleged tax evasion charges.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn 3 July 2012, briefing the joint parliamentary committee probing the scam, ED claimed that it has enough evidence to convict DMK chief Karunanidhi's wife and daughter Kanimozhi.\n\nKanimozhi has defended herself by arguing that she is only a 20% shareholder in the company, who has no involvement in the financial aspects or the liability of a director.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-07/india/29519916_1_kalaignar-tv-mere-shareholder-kanimozhi | work=The Times Of India | title=I am not involved in day-to-day running of Kalaignar TV}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the trial, Kanimozhi's name was cleared by at least one witness who deposed that she had no involvement in the day-to-day affairs of Kalaignar TV and that she was initially reluctant to join the management of the channel. It was also admitted in court that Kanimozhi resigned from Kalaignar board after only two weeks to become a Member of Parliament. In an extraordinary twist, on 21 December 2017 a special CBI court acquitted her along with 19 others accused including A. Raja in 2G spectrum allocation cases. The Court said that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove any of its charge. Thus all accused are acquitted.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kanimozhi}}\n[[Category:1968 births]]\n[[Category:Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam politicians]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Indian atheists]]\n[[Category:Ethiraj College for Women alumni]]\n[[Category:Rajya Sabha members from Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:2G spectrum case]]\n[[Category:Karunanidhi family]]\n[[Category:Women in Tamil Nadu politics]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian women politicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian politicians]]\n[[Category:Women members of the Rajya Sabha]]\n[[Category:Women members of the Lok Sabha]]\n[[Category:17th Lok Sabha members]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian politician}}\n{{Indian name|Kanimozhi|Muthuvel Karunanidhi}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=December 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| image            =The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri M.
