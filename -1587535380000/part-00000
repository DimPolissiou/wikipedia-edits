Easter Island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called ''[[moai]]'', created by the early [[Rapa Nui people]]. In 1995, [[UNESCO]] named Easter Island a [[World Heritage Site]], with much of the island protected within [[Rapa Nui National Park]].\n\nIt is believed that Easter Island's Polynesian inhabitants arrived on Easter Island sometime near 1200 AD.<ref name=terry_hunt/> They created a thriving and industrious culture, as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone ''moai'' and other artifacts. However, land clearing for cultivation and the introduction of the [[Polynesian rat]] led to gradual [[deforestation]].<ref name=terry_hunt/> By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population was estimated to be 2,000\u20133,000.

The island was first scouted after Haumaka dreamed of such a far-off country; Hotu deemed it a worthwhile place to flee from a neighboring chief, one to whom he had already lost three battles.  At their time of arrival, the island had one lone settler, Nga Tavake 'a Te Rona.  After a brief stay at Anakena, the colonists settled in different parts of the island.  Hotu's heir, Tu'u ma Heke, was born on the island.  Tu'u ko Iho is viewed as the leader who brought the statues and caused them to walk.<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=Island at the End of the World|date=2005|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9781861892829|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islandatendofwor00stev/page/14 14], [https://archive.org/details/islandatendofwor00stev/page/38 38]}}</ref>\n\nThe Easter Islanders are considered to be South-East Polynesians.  Similar sacred zones with statuary (''[[marae]]'' and [[Ahu (Easter Island)|''ahu'']]) in East Polynesia demonstrates homology with most of Eastern Polynesia. At contact, populations were about 3,000-4,000.<ref name=Fischer/>{{rp|17\u201318,20\u201321,31,41\u201345}}\n\nBy the 15th century, two confederations, ''hanau'', of social groupings, ''mata'', existed, based on lineage.  The western and northern portion of the island belonged to the Tu'u, which included the royal Miru, with the royal center at Anakena, though Tahai and Te Peu served as earlier capitals.  The eastern portion of the island belonged to the 'Otu 'Itu.  Shortly after the Dutch visit, from 1724 until 1750, the 'Otu 'Itu fought the Tu'u for control of the island.  This fighting continued until the 1860s.  Famine followed the burning of huts and the destruction of fields.  Social control vanished as the ordered way of life gave way to lawlessness and predatory bands as the warrior class took over.  Homelessness prevailed, with many living underground.  After the Spanish visit, from 1770 onwards, a period of statue toppling, ''huri mo'ai'', commenced. This was an attempt by competing groups to destroy the socio-spiritual power, or ''mana'', represented by statues, making sure to break them in the fall to ensure they were dead and without power.  None were left standing by the time of the arrival of the French missionaries in the 1860s.<ref name=Fischer/>{{rp|21\u201324,27,54\u201356,64\u201365}}\n\nBetween 1862 and 1888, about 94% of the population perished or emigrated.  The island was victimized by [[blackbirding]] from 1862 to 1863, resulting in the abduction or killing of about 1,500, with 1,408 working as [[indentured servant]]s in Peru.  Only about a dozen eventually returned to Easter Island, but they brought smallpox, which decimated the remaining population of 1,500.  Those who perished included the island's ''tumu ivi 'atua'', bearers of the island's culture, history, and genealogy besides the ''rongorongo'' experts.<ref name=Fischer/>{{rp|86\u201391}}\n\n===Rapa Nui settlement===\nEstimated dates of initial settlement of Easter Island have ranged from 300 to 1200 AD, though the current best estimate for colonization is in the 12th century AD.  Easter Island colonization likely coincided with the arrival of the first settlers in Hawaii. Rectifications in [[radiocarbon dating]] have changed almost all of the previously posited early settlement dates in Polynesia. Ongoing archaeological studies provide this late date: \"Radiocarbon dates for the earliest stratigraphic layers at Anakena, Easter Island, and analysis of previous radiocarbon dates imply that the island was colonized late, about 1200 AD. Significant ecological impacts and major cultural investments in monumental architecture and statuary thus began soon after initial settlement.\"<ref name=\"huntlipo2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=T.

Researchers have noted that the Caleta Anakena landing point provides the island's best shelter from prevailing swells as well as a sandy beach for canoe landings and launchings, so it is a likely early place of settlement. However [[radiocarbon dating]] concludes that other sites preceded Anakena by many years, especially the [[Tahai]] by several centuries.\n\nThe island was most likely populated by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or [[catamaran]]s from the [[Gambier Islands]] (Mangareva, {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} away) or the [[Marquesas Islands]], {{convert|3200|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. According to some theories, such as the [[Polynesian Diaspora Theory]], there is a possibility that early Polynesian settlers arrived from [[South America]] due to their remarkable sea-navigation abilities. Theorists have supported this through the agricultural evidence of the [[sweet potato]]. The sweet potato was a favoured crop in Polynesian society for generations but it originated in South America, suggesting interaction between these two geographic areas.<ref>Rank, Michael (2013) ''Lost Civilizations''. Seattle: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. pp. 46\u201347.</ref> However, recent research suggests that sweet potatoes may have spread to Polynesia by long-distance dispersal long before the Polynesians arrived.<ref name=\"Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguezCarruthers2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez|first1=Pablo|last2=Carruthers|first2=Tom|last3=Wood|first3=John R.I.|last4=Williams|first4=Bethany R.M.|last5=Weitemier|first5=Kevin|last6=Kronmiller|first6=Brent|last7=Ellis|first7=David|last8=Anglin|first8=Noelle L.|last9=Longway|first9=Lucas|last10=Harris|first10=Stephen A.|last11=Rausher|first11=Mark D.|last12=Kelly|first12=Steven|last13=Liston|first13=Aaron|last14=Scotland|first14=Robert W.|title=Reconciling Conflicting Phylogenies in the Origin of Sweet Potato and Dispersal to Polynesia|journal=Current Biology|volume=28|issue=8|year=2018|pages=1246\u20131256.e12|issn=0960-9822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.020|pmid=29657119|doi-access=free}}</ref> When [[James Cook]] visited the island, one of his crew members, a Polynesian from [[Bora Bora]], Hitihiti, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|296\u2013297}} The language most similar to Rapa Nui is [[Mangarevan]], with an estimated 80% similar vocabulary.

The high chief was the eldest descendant through first-born lines of the island's legendary founder, [[Hotu Matu'a]]. The most visible element in the culture was the production of massive moai statues that some believe represented [[ancestor worship|deified ancestors]]. According to ''National Geographic'', \"Most scholars suspect that the moai were created to honor ancestors, chiefs, or other important personages, However, no written and little oral history exists on the island, so it\u2019s impossible to be certain.\"<ref>[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/easter-island/ Easter Island] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403193826/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/easter-island/ |date=3 April 2014 }}.

Most settlements were located on the coast, and most moai were erected along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea.\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] suggested that [[cannibalism]] took place on Easter Island after the construction of the moai contributed to [[Natural environment|environment]]al degradation when extreme deforestation destabilized an already precarious ecosystem.<ref>[[Bo Rothstein|Rothstein, Bo]] (2005).

The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 metres (10 feet). Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities.

The original [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] are now gone, but [[paleobotany|paleobotanical]] studies of [[fossil]] [[pollen]], tree moulds left by [[lava]] flows, and root casts found in local [[soil]]s indicate that the island was formerly forested, with a range of trees, shrubs, ferns, and grasses. A large [[extinction|extinct]] [[Arecaceae|palm]], ''[[Paschalococos|Paschalococos disperta]]'', related to the [[Chilean wine palm]] ''([[Jubaea]] chilensis)'', was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence. Like its Chilean counterpart it probably took close to 100 years to reach adult height. The [[Polynesian rat]], which the original settlers brought with them, played a very important role in the disappearance of the Rapa Nui palm. Although some may believe that rats played a major role in the degradation of the forest, less than 10% of palm nuts show teeth marks from rats. The remains of palm stumps in different places indicate that humans caused the trees to fall because in large areas, the stumps were cut efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2009.10.006| title = Humans, climate or introduced rats \u2013 which is to blame for the woodland destruction on prehistoric Rapa Nui (Easter Island)?| journal = Journal of Archaeological Science| volume = 37| issue = 2| pages = 417| year = 2010| last1 = Mieth | first1 = A. | last2 = Bork | first2 = H.

However the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and the [[G\u00f6teborg Botanical Garden]] are jointly leading a scientific program to reintroduce the toromiro to Easter Island. With the palm and the toromiro virtually gone, there was considerably less rainfall as a result of less condensation. After the island was used to feed thousands of sheep for almost a century, by the mid-1900s the island was mostly covered in [[grassland]] with [[totora (plant)|''nga'atu'' or bulrush]] (''Schoenoplectus californicus tatora'') in the crater lakes of Rano Raraku and Rano Kau. The presence of these reeds, which are called ''totora'' in the [[Andes]], was used to support the argument of a South American origin of the statue builders, but pollen analysis of lake sediments shows these reeds have grown on the island for over 30,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Before the arrival of humans, Easter Island had vast [[seabird]] colonies containing probably over 30 resident species, perhaps the world's richest.<ref>{{harvnb|Steadman|2006|pp=251, 395}}</ref> Such colonies are no longer found on the main island.

Nunn (1999, 2003); Orliac and Orliac (1998)</ref> point to the climatic downtrend caused by the Little Ice Age as a contributing factor to resource stress and to the palm tree's disappearance. Experts, however, do not agree on when the island's palms became extinct.\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] dismisses past climate change as a dominant cause of the island's deforestation in his book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]'' which assesses the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders.{{sfn |Diamond |2005 |pp=79\u2013119}} Influenced by Heyerdahl's romantic interpretation of Easter's history, Diamond insists that the disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th centuries. He notes that they stopped making statues at that time and started destroying the ahu. But the link is weakened because the Bird Man cult continued to thrive and survived the great impact caused by the arrival of explorers, whalers, [[sandalwood]] traders, and slave raiders.\n\n[[Midden]] contents show that the main source of protein was [[tuna]] and dolphin. With the loss of the trees, there was a sudden drop in the quantities of fish bones found in middens as the islanders lost the means to construct fishing vessels, coinciding with a large increase in bird bones. This was followed by a decrease in the number of bird bones as birds lost their nesting sites or became extinct. A new style of art from this period shows people with exposed ribs and distended bellies, indicative of malnutrition, and it is around this time that many islanders moved to living in fortified caves and the first signs of warfare and [[cannibalism]] appear.\n\n[[Soil erosion]] because of lack of trees is apparent in some places. Sediment samples document that up to half of the native plants had become extinct and that the vegetation of the island drastically altered. Polynesians were primarily farmers, not fishermen, and their diet consisted mainly of cultivated staples such as taro root, sweet potato, yams, cassava, and bananas. With no trees to protect them, sea spray led to crop failures exacerbated by a sudden reduction in fresh water flows. There is evidence that the islanders took to planting crops in caves beneath collapsed ceilings and covered the soil with rocks to reduce evaporation. Cannibalism occurred on many Polynesian islands, sometimes in times of plenty as well as famine. Its presence on Easter Island (based on human remains associated with cooking sites, especially in caves) is supported by oral histories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[Benny Peiser]]<ref name=peiser/> noted evidence of self-sufficiency when Europeans first arrived. The island still had smaller trees, mainly [[toromiro]], which became extinct in the wild in the 20th century probably because of slow growth and changes in the island's ecosystem. Cornelis Bouman, [[Jakob Roggeveen]]'s captain, stated in his [[logbook]], \"... of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], bananas and small [[coconut palm]]s we saw little and no other trees or crops.\" According to Carl Friedrich Behrens, Roggeveen's officer, \"The natives presented palm branches as peace offerings.\" According to ethnographer Alfred M\u00e8traux, the most common type of house was called \"hare paenga\" (and is known today as \"boat house\") because the roof resembled an overturned boat. The foundations of the houses were made of buried basalt slabs with holes for wooden beams to connect with each other throughout the width of the house. These were then covered with a layer of totora reed, followed by a layer of woven sugarcane leaves, and lastly a layer of woven grass.\n\nPeiser claims that these reports indicate that large trees existed at that time, which is perhaps contradicted by the Bouman quote above. Plantations were often located farther inland, next to foothills, inside open-ceiling lava tubes, and in other places protected from the strong salt winds and salt spray affecting areas closer to the coast. It is possible many of the Europeans did not venture inland. The statue quarry, only one kilometre ({{convert|1|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from the coast with an impressive cliff {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} high, was not explored by Europeans until well into the 19th century.\n\n{{wide image|Pano Anakena beach.jpg|800px|Panorama of [[Anakena]] beach, Easter Island. The moai pictured here was the first to be raised back into place on its ''ahu'' in 1955 by Thor Heyerdahl<ref name=\"Heyerdahl 1961\">{{harvnb|Heyerdahl|1961}}</ref> using the labor of islanders and wooden levers.}}\n\nEaster Island has suffered from heavy soil erosion in recent centuries, perhaps aggravated by agriculture and massive [[deforestation]]. This process seems to have been gradual and may have been aggravated by [[sheep farming]] throughout most of the 20th century. Jakob Roggeveen reported that Easter Island was exceptionally fertile. \"Fowls are the only animals they keep. They cultivate bananas, sugar cane, and above all sweet potatoes.\" In 1786 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse visited Easter Island and his gardener declared that \"three days' work a year\" would be enough to support the population. Rollin, a major in the P\u00e9rouse expedition, wrote, \"Instead of meeting with men exhausted by famine... I found, on the contrary, a considerable population, with more beauty and grace than I afterwards met in any other island; and a soil, which, with very little labor, furnished excellent provisions, and in an abundance more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heyerdahl|1961|p=57}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Diamond, the oral traditions (the veracity of which has been questioned by Routledge, [[Henri Lavachery|Lavachery]], M\u00e8traux, Peiser and others) of the current islanders seem obsessed with cannibalism, which he offers as evidence supporting a rapid collapse. For example, he states, to severely insult an enemy one would say, \"The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth.\" This, Diamond asserts, means the food supply of the people ultimately ran out.<ref>{{harvnb|Diamond|2005|p=109}}</ref> Cannibalism, however, was widespread across Polynesian cultures.<ref name=\"Kirch 2003\">{{cite web|url=http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~oal/background/pacislands.htm|title=Introduction to Pacific Islands Archaeology|last=Kirch|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Vinton Kirch|year=2003|publisher=Social Science Computing Laboratory, [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206100604/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~oal/background/pacislands.htm|archivedate=6 December 2008|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> Human bones have not been found in earth ovens other than those behind the religious platforms, indicating that cannibalism in Easter Island was a ritualistic practice.

The native islanders who carved them used only stone hand chisels, mainly basalt ''toki'', which lie in place all over the quarry. The stone chisels were sharpened by chipping off a new edge when dulled. While sculpting was going on, the volcanic stone was splashed with water to soften it. While many teams worked on different statues at the same time, a single moai took a team of five or six men approximately a year to complete. Each statue represented the deceased head of a [[:wikt:lineage|lineage]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nOnly a quarter of the statues were installed. Nearly half remained in the quarry at Rano Raraku, and the rest sat elsewhere, presumably on their way to intended locations. The largest moai raised on a platform is known as \"Paro\".

This would serve to provide a better centre of gravity for transport.\n* The statues found along the transport roads have wider bases than statues installed on ahu; this would facilitate more stable transport. Studies have shown fractures along the bases of the statues in transport; these could have arisen from rocking the statue back and forth and placing great pressures on the edges. The statues found mounted on ahu do not have wide bases, and stone chips found at the sites suggest they were further modified on placement.\n* The abandoned and fallen statues near the old roads are found (more often than would be expected from chance) face down on ascending grades and on their backs when headed uphill. Some were documented standing upright along the old roads, e.g., by a party from Captain Cook's voyage that rested in the shade of a standing statue. This would be consistent with upright transport.\n\nThere is debate regarding the effects of the monument creation process on the environment. Some believe that the process of creating the moai caused widespread deforestation and ultimately a civil war over scarce resources.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Easter Islanders' Weapons Were Deliberately Not Lethal|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160222-easter-island-rapa-nui-collapse-archaeology-moai-mataa-warfare-weapons-Jared-Diamond/|website = National Geographic News|date = 22 February 2016|access-date = 2016-02-24|first = Kristin|last = Romey|url-status=live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160223101557/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160222-easter-island-rapa-nui-collapse-archaeology-moai-mataa-warfare-weapons-Jared-Diamond/|archivedate = 23 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a large moai statue was excavated from the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eisp.org/3879/ |title=Easter Island Statue Project Field Season IV |publisher=Eisp.org |accessdate=23 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725230401/http://www.eisp.org/3879/ |archive-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> During the same excavation program, some larger moai were found to have complex dorsal [[petroglyph]]s, revealed by deep excavation of the torso.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eisp.org/category/about/featured/ |title=Featured Articles Phase 2 Season 2 |author=Jo Anne Van Tilberg |website=Easter Island Statue Project |access-date=15 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717025243/http://www.eisp.org/category/about/featured/ |archive-date=17 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, a pickup truck crashed into and destroyed a moai statue due to brake failure.

The Mataveri end of Hanga Roa is visible in the background with [[Rano Kau]] rising above it.]]\n\n''Ahu'' are stone platforms. Varying greatly in layout, many were reworked during or after [[Moai#1722\u20131868 Toppling of the Moai|the ''huri mo'ai'' or ''statue-toppling'']] era; many became [[ossuary|ossuaries]], one was dynamited open, and [[Ahu Tongariki]] was swept inland by a [[tsunami]]. Of the 313 known ahu, 125 carried moai\u2014usually just one, probably because of the shortness of the moai period and transportation difficulties. [[Ahu Tongariki]], one kilometre ({{convert|1|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Rano Raraku, had the most and tallest moai, 15 in total.{{sfn |Diamond |2005 |pp=80}} Other notable ahu with moai are [[Ahu Akivi]], restored in 1960 by [[William Mulloy]], Nau Nau at Anakena and Tahai. Some moai may have been made from wood and were lost.\n\nThe classic elements of ahu design are:\n* A retaining rear wall several feet high, usually facing the sea\n* A front wall made of rectangular basalt slabs called ''paenga''\n* A fascia made of red scoria that went over the front wall (platforms built after 1300)\n* A sloping ramp in the inland part of the platform, extending outward like wings\n* A pavement of even-sized, round water-worn stones called ''poro''\n* An alignment of stones before the ramp\n* A paved plaza before the ahu. This was called ''marae''\n* Inside the ahu was a fill of rubble.\n\nOn top of many ahu would have been:\n* Moai on squareish  \"pedestals\" looking inland, the ramp with the poro before them.\n* Pukao or Hau Hiti Rau on the moai heads (platforms built after 1300).\n* When a ceremony took place, \"eyes\" were placed on the statues. The whites of the eyes were made of coral, the iris was made of obsidian or red scoria.\n\nAhu evolved from the traditional Polynesian ''[[marae]]''. In this context, ''ahu'' referred to a small structure sometimes covered with a thatched roof where sacred objects, including statues, were stored. The ahu were usually adjacent to the marae or main central court where ceremonies took place, though on Easter Island, ahu and moai evolved to much greater size. There the marae is the unpaved plaza before the ahu. The biggest ahu is {{convert|220|m|ft}} and holds 15 statues, some of which are {{convert|9|m|ft}} high. The filling of an ahu was sourced locally (apart from broken, old moai, fragments of which have been used in the fill).<ref name=\"Heyerdahl 1961\" /> Individual stones are mostly far smaller than the moai, so less work was needed to transport the raw material, but artificially levelling the terrain for the plaza and filling the ahu was laborious.\n\nAhu are found mostly on the coast, where they are distributed fairly evenly, except on the western slopes of Mount [[Terevaka]] and the Rano Kau and [[Poike]]<ref>Heavy erosion and landslides may have buried them in soil.</ref> headlands. These are the three areas with the least low-lying coastal land and, apart from Poike, the furthest areas from Rano Raraku. One ahu with several moai was recorded on the cliffs at Rano Kau in the 1880s but had fallen to the beach before the [[Katherine Routledge|Routledge expedition]].<ref name=routledge/>\n\n[[File:Rapa nui cyark 2.jpg|thumb|right|A Hare Moa, a Chicken House, image cut from a [[3D scanner|laser scan]] collected by nonprofit [[CyArk]].]]\n\n====Stone walls====\nOne of the highest-quality examples of Easter Island stone masonry is the rear wall of the ahu at [[Ahu Vinapu|Vinapu]]. Made without mortar by shaping hard basalt rocks of up to 7 [[tonne]]s to match each other exactly, it has a superficial similarity to some [[Inca]] stone walls in South America.<ref>{{harvnb|Heyerdahl|1961}} However, [[Alfred Metraux]] pointed out that the rubble filled Rapanui walls were a fundamentally different design to those of the Inca, as these are trapezoidal in shape as opposed to the perfectly fitted rectangular stones of the Inca.

Related stone structures called ''Tupa'' look very similar to the ''hare oka'', except that the ''Tupa'' were inhabited by astronomer-priests and located near the coast, where the movements of the stars could be easily observed. Settlements also contain ''hare moa'' (\"chicken house\"), oblong stone structures that housed chickens. The houses at the ceremonial village of Orongo are unique in that they are shaped like ''hare paenga'' but are made entirely of flat basalt slabs found inside Rano Kao crater. The entrances to all the houses are very low, and entry requires crawling.\n\nIn early times the people of Rapa Nui reportedly sent the dead out to sea in small funerary canoes, as did their Polynesian counterparts on other islands. They later started burying people in secret caves to save the bones from desecration by enemies. During the turmoil of the late 18th century, the islanders seem to have started to bury their dead in the space between the belly of a fallen moai and the front wall of the structure. During the time of the epidemics they made mass graves that were semi-pyramidal stone structures.\n\n====Petroglyphs====\n[[Petroglyph]]s are pictures carved into rock, and Easter Island has one of the richest collections in all [[Polynesia]]. Around 1,000 sites with more than 4,000 petroglyphs are catalogued. Designs and images were carved out of rock for a variety of reasons: to create totems, to mark territory, or to memorialize a person or event. There are distinct variations around the island in the frequency of themes among petroglyphs, with a concentration of Birdmen at Orongo. Other subjects include [[sea turtle]]s, Komari (vulvas) and Makemake, the chief god of the ''[[Tangata manu]]'' or Birdman cult.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1992}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\" align=\"centre\" caption=\"Petroglyphs\">\nFile:Makemake.jpeg|[[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]] with two [[Tangata Manu|birdmen]], carved from red [[scoria]]\nFile:Ahu-Tongariki-4-Petroglyph.JPG|Fish petroglyph found near [[Ahu Tongariki]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Caves====\nThe island and neighbouring [[Motu Nui]] are riddled with caves, many of which show signs of past human use for planting and as fortifications, including narrowed entrances and crawl spaces with ambush points. Many caves feature in the myths and legends of the Rapa Nui.\n\n====Other stones====\n{{Anchor|Hiro's Trumpet}}The ''Pu o Hiro''  or ''Hiro's Trumpet'' is a stone on the north coast of Easter Island.

Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; the texts were incised in wood in reverse [[boustrophedon]] direction. It was first reported by French missionary [[Eug\u00e8ne Eyraud]] in 1864. At that time, several islanders said they could understand the writing, but according to tradition, only ruling families and priests were ever literate, and none survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived: only two dozen texts, none of which remain on the island. There are also only a couple of similarities with the [[Easter Island#Petroglyphs|petroglyphs]] on the island.<ref>Fischer, pp. 31, 63.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Wood carving===\n<!-- [[Gallery of flags by design]], [[Flag of Rapa Nui]] both link here -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\"\n|- caption=\"Wood carving\"\n| [[File:Skeletal easter island statue.JPG|100px]] || [[File:Fat wooden Moai.JPG|130px]]\n|-\n| Skeletal statuette || Atypical portly statuette\n|}\nWood was scarce on Easter Island during the 18th and 19th centuries, but a number of highly detailed and distinctive carvings have found their way to the world's museums.

Easter Island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called ''[[moai]]'', created by the early [[Rapa Nui people]].

The island was first scouted after Haumaka dreamed of such a far-off country; Hotu deemed it a worthwhile place to flee from a neighboring chief, one to whom he had already lost three battles.  At their time of arrival, the island had one lone settler, Nga Tavake 'a Te Rona.  After a brief stay at Anakena, the colonists settled in different parts of the island.  Hotu's heir, Tu'u ma Heke, was born on the island.  Tu'u ko Iho is viewed as the leader who brought the statues and caused them to walk.<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=Island at the End of the World|date=2005|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9781861892829|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islandatendofwor00stev/page/14 14], [https://archive.org/details/islandatendofwor00stev/page/38 38]}}</ref>\n\nThe Easter Islanders are considered to be South-East Polynesians.  Similar sacred zones with statuary (''[[marae]]'' and [[Ahu (Easter Island)|''ahu'']]) in East Polynesia demonstrates homology with most of Eastern Polynesia. At contact, populations were about 3,000-4,000.<ref name=Fischer/>{{rp|17\u201318,20\u201321,31,41\u201345}}\n\nBy the 15th century, two confederations, ''hanau'', of social groupings, ''mata'', existed, based on lineage.  The western and northern portion of the island belonged to the Tu'u, which included the royal Miru, with the royal center at Anakena, though Tahai and Te Peu served as earlier capitals.  The eastern portion of the island belonged to the 'Otu 'Itu.  Shortly after the Dutch visit, from 1724 until 1750, the 'Otu 'Itu fought the Tu'u for control of the island.  This fighting continued until the 1860s.  Famine followed the burning of huts and the destruction of fields.  Social control vanished as the ordered way of life gave way to lawlessness and predatory bands as the warrior class took over.  Homelessness prevailed, with many living underground.  After the Spanish visit, from 1770 onwards, a period of statue toppling, ''huri mo'ai'', commenced. This was an attempt by competing groups to destroy the socio-spiritual power, or ''mana'', represented by statues, making sure to break them in the fall to ensure they were dead and without power.  None were left standing by the time of the arrival of the French missionaries in the 1860s.<ref name=Fischer/>{{rp|21\u201324,27,54\u201356,64\u201365}}\n\nBetween 1862 and 1888, about 94% of the population perished or emigrated.  The island was victimized by [[blackbirding]] from 1862 to 1863, resulting in the abduction or killing of about 1,500, with 1,408 working as [[indentured servant]]s in Peru.  Only about a dozen eventually returned to Easter Island, but they brought smallpox, which decimated the remaining population of 1,500.  Those who perished included the island's ''tumu ivi 'atua'', bearers of the island's culture, history, and genealogy besides the ''rongorongo'' experts.<ref name=Fischer/>{{rp|86\u201391}}\n\n===Rapa Nui settlement===\nEstimated dates of initial settlement of Easter Island have ranged from 300 to 1200 AD, though the current best estimate for colonization is in the 12th century AD.  Easter Island colonization likely coincided with the arrival of the first settlers in Hawaii. Rectifications in [[radiocarbon dating]] have changed almost all of the previously posited early settlement dates in Polynesia. Ongoing archaeological studies provide this late date: \"Radiocarbon dates for the earliest stratigraphic layers at Anakena, Easter Island, and analysis of previous radiocarbon dates imply that the island was colonized late, about 1200 AD. Significant ecological impacts and major cultural investments in monumental architecture and statuary thus began soon after initial settlement.\"<ref name=\"huntlipo2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=T.

Researchers have noted that the Caleta Anakena landing point provides the island's best shelter from prevailing swells as well as a sandy beach for canoe landings and launchings, so it is a likely early place of settlement. However [[radiocarbon dating]] concludes that other sites preceded Anakena by many years, especially the [[Tahai]] by several centuries.\n\nThe island was most likely populated by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or [[catamaran]]s from the [[Gambier Islands]] (Mangareva, {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} away) or the [[Marquesas Islands]], {{convert|3200|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. According to some theories, such as the [[Polynesian Diaspora Theory]], there is a possibility that early Polynesian settlers arrived from [[South America]] due to their remarkable sea-navigation abilities. Theorists have supported this through the agricultural evidence of the [[sweet potato]]. The sweet potato was a favoured crop in Polynesian society for generations but it originated in South America, suggesting interaction between these two geographic areas.<ref>Rank, Michael (2013) ''Lost Civilizations''. Seattle: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. pp. 46\u201347.</ref> However, recent research suggests that sweet potatoes may have spread to Polynesia by long distance dispersal long before the Polynesians arrived.<ref name=\"Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguezCarruthers2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Rodr\u00edguez|first1=Pablo|last2=Carruthers|first2=Tom|last3=Wood|first3=John R.I.|last4=Williams|first4=Bethany R.M.|last5=Weitemier|first5=Kevin|last6=Kronmiller|first6=Brent|last7=Ellis|first7=David|last8=Anglin|first8=Noelle L.|last9=Longway|first9=Lucas|last10=Harris|first10=Stephen A.|last11=Rausher|first11=Mark D.|last12=Kelly|first12=Steven|last13=Liston|first13=Aaron|last14=Scotland|first14=Robert W.|title=Reconciling Conflicting Phylogenies in the Origin of Sweet Potato and Dispersal to Polynesia|journal=Current Biology|volume=28|issue=8|year=2018|pages=1246\u20131256.e12|issn=0960-9822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.020|pmid=29657119|doi-access=free}}</ref> When [[James Cook]] visited the island, one of his crew members, a Polynesian from [[Bora Bora]], Hitihiti, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui.<ref name=Anne/>{{rp|296\u2013297}} The language most similar to Rapa Nui is [[Mangarevan]], with an estimated 80% similar vocabulary.

The high chief was the eldest descendant through first-born lines of the island's legendary founder, [[Hotu Matu'a]]. The most visible element in the culture was the production of massive moai statues that some believe represented [[ancestor worship|deified ancestors]]. According to ''National Geographic'', \"Most scholars suspect that the moai were created to honor ancestors, chiefs, or other important personages, However, no written and little oral history exists on the island, so it\u2019s impossible to be certain.\"<ref>[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/easter-island/ Easter Island] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403193826/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/world-heritage/easter-island/ |date=3 April 2014 }}.

Most settlements were located on the coast, and most moai were erected along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea.\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] suggested that [[cannibalism]] took place on Easter Island after the construction of the moai contributed to [[Natural environment|environment]]al degradation when extreme deforestation destabilized an already precarious ecosystem.<ref>[[Bo Rothstein|Rothstein, Bo]] (2005).

The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 metres (10 feet). Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities.

A large [[extinction|extinct]] [[Arecaceae|palm]], ''[[Paschalococos|Paschalococos disperta]]'', related to the [[Chilean wine palm]] ''([[Jubaea]] chilensis)'', was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence. Like its Chilean counterpart it probably took close to 100 years to reach adult height. The [[Polynesian rat]], which the original settlers brought with them, played a very important role in the disappearance of the Rapa Nui palm. Although some may believe that rats played a major role in the degradation of the forest, less than 10% of palm nuts show teeth marks from rats. The remains of palm stumps in different places indicate that humans caused the trees to fall because in large areas, the stumps were cut efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jas.2009.10.006| title = Humans, climate or introduced rats \u2013 which is to blame for the woodland destruction on prehistoric Rapa Nui (Easter Island)?| journal = Journal of Archaeological Science| volume = 37| issue = 2| pages = 417| year = 2010| last1 = Mieth | first1 = A. | last2 = Bork | first2 = H.

However the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and the [[G\u00f6teborg Botanical Garden]] are jointly leading a scientific program to reintroduce the toromiro to Easter Island. With the palm and the toromiro virtually gone, there was considerably less rainfall as a result of less condensation. After the island was used to feed thousands of sheep for almost a century, by the mid-1900s the island was mostly covered in [[grassland]] with [[totora (plant)|''nga'atu'' or bulrush]] (''Schoenoplectus californicus tatora'') in the crater lakes of [[Rano Raraku]] and [[Rano Kau]]. The presence of these reeds, which are called ''totora'' in the [[Andes]], was used to support the argument of a South American origin of the statue builders, but pollen analysis of lake sediments shows these reeds have grown on the island for over 30,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Before the arrival of humans, Easter Island had vast [[seabird]] colonies containing probably over 30 resident species, perhaps the world's richest.<ref>{{harvnb|Steadman|2006|pp=251, 395}}</ref> Such colonies are no longer found on the main island.

Nunn (1999, 2003); Orliac and Orliac (1998)</ref> point to the climatic downtrend caused by the Little Ice Age as a contributing factor to resource stress and to the palm tree's disappearance. Experts, however, do not agree on when the island's palms became extinct.\n\n[[Jared Diamond]] dismisses past climate change as a dominant cause of the island's deforestation in his book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]'' which assesses the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders.{{sfn |Diamond |2005 |pp=79\u2013119}} Influenced by Heyerdahl's romantic interpretation of Easter's history, Diamond insists that the disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th centuries. He notes that they stopped making statues at that time and started destroying the ahu. But the link is weakened because the Bird Man cult continued to thrive and survived the great impact caused by the arrival of explorers, whalers, [[sandalwood]] traders, and slave raiders.\n\n[[Midden]] contents show that the main source of protein was [[tuna]] and dolphin. With the loss of the trees, there was a sudden drop in the quantities of fish bones found in middens as the islanders lost the means to construct fishing vessels, coinciding with a large increase in bird bones. This was followed by a decrease in the number of bird bones as birds lost their nesting sites or became extinct. A new style of art from this period shows people with exposed ribs and distended bellies, indicative of malnutrition, and it is around this time that many islanders moved to living in fortified caves and the first signs of warfare and [[cannibalism]] appear.\n\n[[Soil erosion]] because of lack of trees is apparent in some places. Sediment samples document that up to half of the native plants had become extinct and that the vegetation of the island drastically altered. Polynesians were primarily farmers, not fishermen, and their diet consisted mainly of cultivated staples such as taro root, sweet potato, yams, cassava, and bananas. With no trees to protect them, sea spray led to crop failures exacerbated by a sudden reduction in fresh water flows. There is evidence that the islanders took to planting crops in caves beneath collapsed ceilings and covered the soil with rocks to reduce evaporation. Cannibalism occurred on many Polynesian islands, sometimes in times of plenty as well as famine. Its presence on Easter Island (based on human remains associated with cooking sites, especially in caves) is supported by oral histories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[Benny Peiser]]<ref name=peiser/> noted evidence of self-sufficiency when Europeans first arrived. The island still had smaller trees, mainly [[toromiro]], which became extinct in the wild in the 20th century probably because of slow growth and changes in the island's ecosystem. Cornelis Bouman, [[Jakob Roggeveen]]'s captain, stated in his [[logbook]], \"... of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], bananas and small [[coconut palm]]s we saw little and no other trees or crops.\" According to Carl Friedrich Behrens, Roggeveen's officer, \"The natives presented palm branches as peace offerings.\" According to ethnographer Alfred M\u00e8traux, the most common type of house was called \"hare paenga\" (and is known today as \"boat house\") because the roof resembled an overturned boat. The foundations of the houses were made of buried basalt slabs with holes for wooden beams to connect with each other throughout the width of the house. These were then covered with a layer of totora reed, followed by a layer of woven sugarcane leaves, and lastly a layer of woven grass.\n\nPeiser claims that these reports indicate that large trees existed at that time, which is perhaps contradicted by the Bouman quote above. Plantations were often located farther inland, next to foothills, inside open-ceiling lava tubes, and in other places protected from the strong salt winds and salt spray affecting areas closer to the coast. It is possible many of the Europeans did not venture inland. The statue quarry, only one kilometre ({{convert|1|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from the coast with an impressive cliff {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} high, was not explored by Europeans until well into the 19th century.\n\n{{wide image|Pano Anakena beach.jpg|800px|Panorama of [[Anakena]] beach, Easter Island. The moai pictured here was the first to be raised back into place on its ''ahu'' in 1955 by Thor Heyerdahl<ref name=\"Heyerdahl 1961\">{{harvnb|Heyerdahl|1961}}</ref> using the labor of islanders and wooden levers.}}\n\nEaster Island has suffered from heavy soil erosion in recent centuries, perhaps aggravated by agriculture and massive [[deforestation]]. This process seems to have been gradual and may have been aggravated by [[sheep farming]] throughout most of the 20th century. Jakob Roggeveen reported that Easter Island was exceptionally fertile. \"Fowls are the only animals they keep. They cultivate bananas, sugar cane, and above all sweet potatoes.\" In 1786 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse visited Easter Island and his gardener declared that \"three days' work a year\" would be enough to support the population. Rollin, a major in the P\u00e9rouse expedition, wrote, \"Instead of meeting with men exhausted by famine... I found, on the contrary, a considerable population, with more beauty and grace than I afterwards met in any other island; and a soil, which, with very little labor, furnished excellent provisions, and in an abundance more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heyerdahl|1961|p=57}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Diamond, the oral traditions (the veracity of which has been questioned by Routledge, [[Henri Lavachery|Lavachery]], M\u00e8traux, Peiser and others) of the current islanders seem obsessed with cannibalism, which he offers as evidence supporting a rapid collapse.

This would serve to provide a better centre of gravity for transport.\n* The statues found along the transport roads have wider bases than statues installed on ahu; this would facilitate more stable transport. Studies have shown fractures along the bases of the statues in transport; these could have arisen from rocking the statue back and forth and placing great pressures on the edges. The statues found mounted on ahu do not have wide bases, and stone chips found at the sites suggest they were further modified on placement.\n* The abandoned and fallen statues near the old roads are found (more often than would be expected from chance) face down on ascending grades and on their backs when headed uphill. Some were documented standing upright along the old roads, e.g., by a party from Captain Cook's voyage that rested in the shade of a standing statue. This would be consistent with upright transport.\n\nThere is debate regarding the effects of the monument creation process on the environment.

Varying greatly in layout, many were reworked during or after [[Moai#1722\u20131868 Toppling of the Moai|the ''huri mo'ai'' or ''statue-toppling'']] era; many became [[ossuary|ossuaries]], one was dynamited open, and [[Ahu Tongariki]] was swept inland by a [[tsunami]]. Of the 313 known ahu, 125 carried moai\u2014usually just one, probably because of the shortness of the moai period and transportation difficulties. [[Ahu Tongariki]], one kilometre ({{convert|1|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from Rano Raraku, had the most and tallest moai, 15 in total.{{sfn |Diamond |2005 |pp=80}} Other notable ahu with moai are [[Ahu Akivi]], restored in 1960 by [[William Mulloy]], Nau Nau at [[Anakena]] and Tahai. Some moai may have been made from wood and were lost.\n\nThe classic elements of ahu design are:\n* A retaining rear wall several feet high, usually facing the sea\n* A front wall made of rectangular basalt slabs called ''paenga''\n* A fascia made of red scoria that went over the front wall (platforms built after 1300)\n* A sloping ramp in the inland part of the platform, extending outward like wings\n* A pavement of even-sized, round water-worn stones called ''poro''\n* An alignment of stones before the ramp\n* A paved plaza before the ahu. This was called ''marae''\n* Inside the ahu was a fill of rubble.\n\nOn top of many ahu would have been:\n* Moai on squareish  \"pedestals\" looking inland, the ramp with the poro before them.\n* Pukao or Hau Hiti Rau on the moai heads (platforms built after 1300).\n* When a ceremony took place, \"eyes\" were placed on the statues. The whites of the eyes were made of coral, the iris was made of obsidian or red scoria.\n\nAhu evolved from the traditional Polynesian ''[[marae]]''. In this context, ''ahu'' referred to a small structure sometimes covered with a thatched roof where sacred objects, including statues, were stored. The ahu were usually adjacent to the marae or main central court where ceremonies took place, though on Easter Island, ahu and moai evolved to much greater size. There the marae is the unpaved plaza before the ahu. The biggest ahu is {{convert|220|m|ft}} and holds 15 statues, some of which are {{convert|9|m|ft}} high. The filling of an ahu was sourced locally (apart from broken, old moai, fragments of which have been used in the fill).<ref name=\"Heyerdahl 1961\" /> Individual stones are mostly far smaller than the moai, so less work was needed to transport the raw material, but artificially levelling the terrain for the plaza and filling the ahu was laborious.\n\nAhu are found mostly on the coast, where they are distributed fairly evenly, except on the western slopes of Mount [[Terevaka]] and the [[Rano Kau]] and [[Poike]]<ref>Heavy erosion and landslides may have buried them in soil.</ref> headlands. These are the three areas with the least low-lying coastal land and, apart from Poike, the furthest areas from [[Rano Raraku]].

Related stone structures called ''Tupa'' look very similar to the ''hare oka'', except that the ''Tupa'' were inhabited by astronomer-priests and located near the coast, where the movements of the stars could be easily observed. Settlements also contain ''hare moa'' (\"chicken house\"), oblong stone structures that housed chickens. The houses at the ceremonial village of [[Orongo]] are unique in that they are shaped like ''hare paenga'' but are made entirely of flat basalt slabs found inside Rano Kao crater. The entrances to all the houses are very low, and entry requires crawling.\n\nIn early times the people of Rapa Nui reportedly sent the dead out to sea in small funerary canoes, as did their Polynesian counterparts on other islands. They later started burying people in secret caves to save the bones from desecration by enemies. During the turmoil of the late 18th century, the islanders seem to have started to bury their dead in the space between the belly of a fallen moai and the front wall of the structure. During the time of the epidemics they made mass graves that were semi-pyramidal stone structures.\n\n====Petroglyphs====\n[[Petroglyph]]s are pictures carved into rock, and Easter Island has one of the richest collections in all [[Polynesia]]. Around 1,000 sites with more than 4,000 petroglyphs are catalogued. Designs and images were carved out of rock for a variety of reasons: to create totems, to mark territory, or to memorialize a person or event. There are distinct variations around the island in the frequency of themes among petroglyphs, with a concentration of Birdmen at [[Orongo]]. Other subjects include [[sea turtle]]s, Komari (vulvas) and [[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]], the chief god of the ''[[Tangata manu]]'' or Birdman cult.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1992}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\" align=\"centre\" caption=\"Petroglyphs\">\nFile:Makemake.jpeg|[[Makemake (mythology)|Makemake]] with two [[Tangata Manu|birdmen]], carved from red [[scoria]]\nFile:Ahu-Tongariki-4-Petroglyph.JPG|Fish petroglyph found near [[Ahu Tongariki]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Caves====\nThe island and neighbouring [[Motu Nui]] are riddled with caves, many of which show signs of past human use for planting and as fortifications, including narrowed entrances and crawl spaces with ambush points. Many caves feature in the myths and legends of the Rapa Nui.\n\n====Other stones====\n{{Anchor|Hiro's Trumpet}}The ''Pu o Hiro''  or ''Hiro's Trumpet'' is a stone on the north coast of Easter Island.

At that time, several islanders said they could understand the writing, but according to tradition, only ruling families and priests were ever literate, and none survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived: only two dozen texts, none of which remain on the island.

With over 200,000 living initiates, Tri Delta is one of the largest [[National Panhellenic Conference]] sororities.\n\n==History==\n{{Peacock|date=June 2018}}\nDelta Delta Delta was founded by Sarah Ida Shaw, Eleanor Dorcas Pond, Florence Isabelle Stewart, and Isabel Morgan Breed at [[Boston University]]. Three women's fraternities were already represented at Boston University in 1888 ([[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Alpha Phi]]). Shaw enlisted the help of Eleanor Dorcas Pond and told her, \"Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.\"\n\nThe two young women began the work of creating a new national fraternity. Later Sarah wrote \"...The two enthusiastic friends were unaware of the fact that there was something stupendous about the task they had set hands, heads and hearts to accomplish. They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.\"\n\nShaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution and designed the emblems. Choosing the name was a mutual decision. Pond suggested a triple letter while Shaw chose the actual letter and developed Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Lore]], [[Hindu|Hindu mysticism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]] and [[Astronomy]], reflecting Shaw's wide and various interests.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Tri Delta as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|last=Domhoff|first=G.

The [[dolphin]] is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the [[ancient Greeks]]. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold and [[cerulean blue]], while the [[pearl]] is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the [[pansy]] as its official flower and the [[pine tree]] as its official tree.\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver [[trident]] on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a [[torse]] with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto ''Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas'' (\"Let us steadfastly love one another\") is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.\n\n===Official insignia===\nTri Delta's official badge is the Stars and Crescent, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her chapter Initiation number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is \"lent\" to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the expectation that the badge will be returned upon the member's death or resignation.\n\nPrior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an \"inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.\" A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.\n\nTri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member's initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of [[Butler University]].\n\n==Programs==\n===Philanthropy===\nMany chapters observe \"Sleighbell Day\" on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children's cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.\n\nIn 1999, Tri Delta partnered with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]]) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP,  and football tailgates on their campuses each year.

Only three-and-a-half years into the 10 year commitment to raise $60 million, Tri Delta hit the halfway point and announced $30 million raised for St. Jude in January 2018. Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude's only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/while-here/housing/tri-delta-place.html|title=Tri Delta Place|website=www.stjude.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\" />\n\nIn addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children's Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at University of Toronto|url = http://utoronto.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = utoronto.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>, the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and local children's cancer charities in various states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at The University of Ottawa|url = http://ottawa.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = ottawa.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity [[baseball]] tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play ([[kickball]] tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named \"Delta House of Pancakes,\" \"Delta Diner,\" or \"TriHOP\", and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in \"Sincerely Yours\", an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|url = http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?company_id=2050&pg=national_company|website = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===''The Trident''===\n''The Trident'' is Tri Delta's official publication, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women's health, editorials, and upcoming events.\n\n==Membership==\n===Leadership===\nActive members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra \"The Office Selects the Officer\", and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.\n\nEach collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice-President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair-positions are tailored to each chapter's specific needs.\n\n===Chapter Development Consultants===\nSince 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.\n\n===Alumnae involvement===\nAfter graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumna chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation's scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumna advisory team. Members volunteering on an international level include members of the National Housing Corporation,<ref>{{cite web|title = National House Corporation|url = http://www.tridelta.org/about/executive-office/nhc/|website = Tri Delta|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}</ref> who manage fraternity properties, and members of the Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Foundation -

With over 200,000 living initiates, Tri Delta is one of the largest [[National Panhellenic Conference]] sororities.\n\n==History==\n{{Peacock|date=June 2018}}\nDelta Delta Delta was founded by Sarah Ida Shaw, Eleanor Dorcas Pond, Florence Isabelle Stewart, and Isabel Morgan Breed at [[Boston University]]. Three women's fraternities were already represented at Boston University in 1888 ([[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Alpha Phi]]). Shaw enlisted the help of Eleanor Dorcas Pond and told her, \"Let us found a society that shall be kind alike to all and think more of a girl's inner self and character than of her personal appearance.\"\n\nThe two young women began the work of creating a new national fraternity. Later Sarah wrote \"...The two enthusiastic friends were unaware of the fact that there was something stupendous about the task they had set hands, heads and hearts to accomplish. They were working for a principle, and it never occurred to them that there could be such a thing as failure. Earnestness of purpose, energy and enthusiasm had brought them both success in college and why should not these same qualities bring assurance of good fortune to the new venture.\"\n\nShaw and Pond wrote the rituals and constitution and designed the emblems. Choosing the name was a mutual decision. Pond suggested a triple letter while Shaw chose the actual letter and developed Greek mottos and passwords. Inspiration came from [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian Lore]], [[Hindu|Hindu mysticism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]] and [[Astronomy]], reflecting Shaw's wide and various interests.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Tri Delta as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Who Rules America?]]|last=Domhoff|first=G.

The [[dolphin]] is recognized as an additional symbol as it was considered to be a good omen by the [[ancient Greeks]]. The colors of Tri Delta are silver, gold and [[cerulean blue]], while the [[pearl]] is its jewel. The sorority recognizes the [[pansy]] as its official flower and the [[pine tree]] as its official tree.\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] consists of a quartered shield, first and fourth quarters in blue with a silver [[trident]] on each, second and third quarters in gold with green pine tree on each. The sorority crest is placed above the shield and consists of a [[torse]] with six folds in alternating gold and blue, from which a white, gold and blue pansy rises. Below the shield, the Greek motto ''Asfalos Agapomen Allaylas'' (\"Let us steadfastly love one another\") is inscribed in Greek characters on a scroll.\n\n===Official insignia===\nTri Delta's official badge is the Stars and Crescent, consisting of three golden stars and a crown set with pearls, within a gold crescent of three hundred degrees bearing three deltas in black enamel. An initiate receives a badge with her initials, the Greek letters of her chapter, and her chapter Initiation number engraved on the back. The badge belongs to the sorority and is \"lent\" to each member during her lifetime or as long as she remains a member, with the expectation that the badge will be returned upon the member's death or resignation.\n\nPrior to initiation, new members wear a new member pin, which is a green and silver enamel badge described as an \"inverted Delta surrounded by three Deltas.\" A new member may also display a trident, which symbolizes the first degree of initiation and is returned prior to initiation into the Stars and Crescent degree. A gold trident may be worn as a badge guard.\n\nTri Delta also has various circle pins to celebrate years since the member's initiation. Introduced in 2004, the Silver Circle Pin may be worn by members who have reached the 25-year anniversary of their initiation. It features the anniversary number engraved on the stars and crescent design. The Golden Circle Pin was originally created by Sarah Ida Shaw for the Circle Degree of Initiation, but its current usage to celebrate 50 years since initiation dates to 1962. This pin consists of three deltas made of gold inside a golden circle, surrounded by six spherical triangles in blue. The Diamond Circle Pin honors members who have served for 75 years with the fraternity. While the design is alike to the Golden Circle Pin, this token features a diamond in the center. This pin was introduced in the year 1996 and the first pin was awarded to Mary K. Wise of [[Butler University]].\n\n==Programs==\n===Philanthropy===\nMany chapters observe \"Sleighbell Day\" on the first Tuesday of December, following the tradition of Sleighbell Luncheon, first held in the 1940s by 13 Southern California chapters to benefit a doctor researching blood diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. In the early 1970s, a national survey established that Tri Delta chapters were interested in children, hospitals, and cancer. At the 1974 Tri Delta Convention, the three were combined to support children's cancer charities as the designated philanthropy.\n\nIn 1999, Tri Delta partnered with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]]. St. Jude (through the fundraising branch, the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]]) assists Tri Delta chapters in planning philanthropy events that benefit the children and subsidize research costs at St. Jude. Many chapters coordinate fundraising activities such as pancake breakfasts, called Delta House of Pancakes or DHOP,  and football tailgates on their campuses each year. Since 1999, Tri Delta has raised more than $30 million for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\">{{cite web|date=January 11, 2012 |title=St. Jude Fundraising Update |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/news/01_11_2012 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> In 2002, Tri Deltas committed to raising $1 million to build a Teen Room at the St. Jude Hospital in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], fulfilling the commitment in 2005. In July 2006, Tri Delta committed to raise $10 million in 10 years to build a new patient treatment floor focusing on brain tumor research at St. Jude, instead raising $10.4 million in 4 years. In 2010, a new philanthropic goal was announced to raise $15 million in 5 years.<ref name=\"15in5\">{{cite web|title=$15 Million in 5 years |url=https://www.tridelta.org/document/aboutus/st_jude_15in5 |publisher=Delta Delta Delta |accessdate=2012-02-28}}{{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref> On February 1, 2014, it was announced that Tri Delta surpassed the $15 million goal in just 3.5 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tridelta.org/news/$15millionraisedforstjudein35years |title=$15 Million Raised for St. Jude in 3.5 Years |publisher=Tri Delta |accessdate=2014-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314145243/http://www.tridelta.org/news/%2415millionraisedforstjudein35years |archivedate=March 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On July 4, 2014, Tri Delta announced a new philanthropic goal to raise $60 million over 10 years, the largest single commitment by a partner of St. Jude in the history of the hospital.  Only three-and-a-half years into the 10 year commitment to raise $60 million, Tri Delta hit the halfway point and announced $30 million raised for St. Jude in January 2018. Their pledge funded the Tri Delta Place, St. Jude's only on-campus housing facility. It includes 64 hotel-style rooms and 36 suites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/while-here/housing/tri-delta-place.html|title=Tri Delta Place|website=www.stjude.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Tri Delta was also named the St. Jude partner of the year for 2014, making Tri Delta the first non-corporation to receive this honor. As of February 2018, Tri Delta has reached the halfway point of this commitment. Since 1999, Tri Delta members have raised more than $70 million to St. Jude. Tri delta continues every year to increase their philanthropy goals for St. Jude.<ref name=\"FundraisingUpdate\" />\n\nIn addition to the national partnership, Tri Delta continues to raise money for local Children's Cancer Charities, including two Canadian Hospitals, the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in [[Toronto, Canada]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at University of Toronto|url = http://utoronto.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = utoronto.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>, the [[Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario]] in [[Ottawa, Canada]], and local children's cancer charities in various states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Chapter Philanthropy {{!}} Delta Delta Delta at The University of Ottawa|url = http://ottawa.tridelta.org/chapter-philanthropy|website = ottawa.tridelta.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\nEvery year, chapters host a variety of events to raise money for these causes. This includes sporting events such as Greeks at Bat (an inter-fraternity [[baseball]] tournament) and Tri Delta Triple Play ([[kickball]] tournament), pancake breakfasts commonly named \"Delta House of Pancakes,\" \"Delta Diner,\" or \"TriHOP\", and spaghetti dinners. Every Tri Delta member also participates in \"Sincerely Yours\", an international writing campaign to raise money for St Jude. Other St. Jude specific philanthropic endeavors includes a Gold Level National Team participation in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|url = http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?company_id=2050&pg=national_company|website = St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n===''The Trident''===\n''The Trident'' is Tri Delta's official publication, published continuously since 1891. The publication includes news about collegiate and alumni members, chapter events, topics in women's health, editorials, and upcoming events.\n\n==Membership==\n===Leadership===\nActive members of each Tri Delta chapter may join a committee or be slated into an office in order to serve the organization and develop leadership skills. During the slating process, members adhere to the mantra \"The Office Selects the Officer\", and undergo the process of determining the officer that is best suited for each office based on her skills and previous experience.\n\nEach collegiate chapter president oversees chapter business, including membership in every team and committee. Each subsequent office is organized into one of the following teams, each headed by a Vice-President: Administration, Chapter Development, Finance, Public Relations, and Membership. Further committees, assistants, and chair-positions are tailored to each chapter's specific needs.\n\n===Chapter Development Consultants===\nSince 1910, Tri Delta has utilized a consultant program, in which recently graduated alumna members are trained and employed by the executive office to visit chapters to provide resources and advice on their chapter business. Chapter Development Consultants provide constructive feedback in order to align the chapter with standards determined by the executive office. Consultants have gone by many names over the years, including field secretaries and field consultants. In 2015, the name was changed to Chapter Development Consultants.\n\n===Alumnae involvement===\nAfter graduation, alumnae may continue to support Tri Delta and stay active within the Greek community via means such as joining an alumna chapter, attending and hosting philanthropy events, donating to the Tri Delta Foundation's scholarships, contributing to The Trident, writing reference letters for potential new members, and volunteering. Alumnae who wish to stay connected to or make a more direct contribution to a specific collegiate chapter may join its alumna advisory team. Members volunteering on an international level include members of the National Housing Corporation,<ref>{{cite web|title = National House Corporation|url = http://www.tridelta.org/about/executive-office/nhc/|website = Tri Delta|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}</ref> who manage fraternity properties, and members of the Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Foundation -

Upon release, Scott said \"No Matter What\" is without question the most personal song I have ever written and the one I am most proud of. It's a song born from loneliness, acceptance and the heartbreaking but liberating tale of my coming out experience.

It's a song born from loneliness, acceptance and the heartbreaking but liberating tale of my coming out experience. What I love about this song is that it isn't just limited to a story of sexual identity, but about the relationship between parent and child and acceptance as a whole.

Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Rise of ''Homo sapiens''===\n[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|World map of early human migrations according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] (numbers are [[millennia]] before present, the North Pole is at the center).]]\n{{main|Homo sapiens}}\n{{see|Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Early human migrations|Multiregional origin of modern humans|Prehistoric autopsy|Recent African origin of modern humans}}\nBy the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), and likely significantly earlier by 100\u201370,000 years ago<ref name=\"McBrearty Brooks 2000\" /><ref name=\"Henshilwood Marean 2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. Human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it provides an evolutionary advantage of more caring time to relatives' young.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nApart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in [[smelling]], [[hearing]], [[digesting]] [[protein]]s, [[brain size]], and the ability of [[language]]. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees.

Women have [[Human skin color#sexual dimorphism|lighter skin]] than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and [[lactation]].

Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the strongest (e.g. [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are highly adapted to high altitudes).

Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.\n\nThe physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].\n\nThe nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. [[Psychologists]] have developed [[intelligence]] [[Test (assessment)|tests]] and the concept of [[intelligence quotient]] in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] among population.<ref>{{Britannica|289811|Intelligence test}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say \"I am conscious.\" Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says \"I am conscious of these words.\" Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well. [[Human ecology]] is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] that investigates how humans and human societies interact with both their natural environment and the human [[social environment]].\n\n===Motivation and emotion===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Main|Motivation|Emotion}}\n[[File:Plate depicting emotions of grief from Charles Darwin's book The Expression of the Emotions.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration of grief from [[Charles Darwin]]'s book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]\n\nHuman motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] is a well-established theory which can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html|title=Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|author=Saul McLeod|date=20 March 2020|website=Simplypsychology.org|publisher=Simply Scholar Limited|access-date=4 April 2020|quote=Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up.}}</ref> From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore, [[incentive]] and [[preference]] are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. [[Volition_(psychology)|Volition]] may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] of goals in an optimal manner, a [[Function_(biology)|function]] beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as [[socialization]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heckhausen, J.|author2=Heckhausen, H.|author-link= |date=28 March 2018|title=Motivation and Action|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1|location=Introduction and Overview|publisher=Springer, Cham|page=1|isbn=978-3-319-65093-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1}}</ref>\n\nHappiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have\u2014a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical health. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or society.\n\nEmotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as love, [[admiration]], or [[joy]], contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].\n\nIn modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.\n\n===Sexuality and love===\n{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]\nFor humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Sexual desire, or ''[[libido]]'', is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features, among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and (among great apes) a relatively large [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[human sperm competition|sperm competition in humans]], the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods.\n\nHuman choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by social norms which vary between cultures. Restrictions are often determined by religious beliefs or social customs. People can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of [[sexual orientation]].<ref name=APASO>{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}</ref> There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.<ref name=\"Bailey\">{{cite journal |author1=Bailey JM |author2=Vasey PL |author3=Diamond LM |author4=Breedlove SM |author5=Vilain E |author6=Epprecht M|title=Sexual Orientation, Controversy, and Science |journal=[[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]]|volume=17|issue=21|date=2016|doi=10.1177/1529100616637616|pmid=27113562|pages=45\u2013101|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/82baedbe57a232a83bea6d88f16d66cf4acdca64|doi-access=free}}</ref> Recent research, including [[neurology]] and [[genetics]], suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.<ref name=Buss2003>{{cite book |author=Buss, David M. |year=2003 |title=The Evolution of Desire: Strategies of Human Mating.

family-based social structures.]]\nHumans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. More than any other creature, humans are capable of using systems of communication for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from the size of families to nations. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety{{clarify|date=January 2014}} of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society.\n\nCulture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.\n\n===Language===\nWhile many species [[animal communication|communicate]], [[language]] is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a [[cultural universal]]. Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open\u2014an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols. Human language also has the capacity of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.<ref name=\"Revolution\"/> Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is [[Origin of speech#Modality-independence|modality independent]]; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as [[braille]]. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including [[sign language]]s, and many thousands more that are [[extinct language|extinct]].<ref name=Comrie1996>{{cite book |author1=Comrie, Bernard |author2=Polinsky, Maria |author3=Matthews, Stephen |title=The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World |year=1996 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |pages=13\u201315 |isbn=978-0-8160-3388-1}}</ref>\n\n===Gender roles===\n{{Main|Gender role|Gender}}\nThe sexual division of humans into male, female, and in some societies other genders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/ |title=A Map of Gender-Diverse Cultures &#124; Independent Lens |publisher=PBS |date=11 August 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, [[practice (social theory)|practices]], dress, behavior, rights, [[duty|duties]], [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[social status|status]], and [[power (philosophy)|power]]. [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.\n\n===Kinship===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Kinship|Marriage}}\n[[File:thedragonpainter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sessue Hayakawa]] (left) with actress and wife [[Tsuru Aoki]] in a screen shot of the 1919 film ''[[The Dragon Painter]]''.]]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children ([[consanguinity]]), and relations through marriage ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited\u2014such rules vary widely between cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity ([[nurture kinship]]).\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Ethnic group}}\nHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>J.

Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved 17 March 2006.</ref>\n\nGovernment can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n\n===Trade and economics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Trade|Economics}}\n[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and sellers [[bargaining]] in a market in [[Tengeru]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economic activity]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a [[medium of exchange]], such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n\nEconomics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].\n\n===War===\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Men in period costume portraying soldiers during a 2011 reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815)]]\n{{Main|War}}\nWar is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others\u2014whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]\u2014to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].\n\nThere have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been [[space warfare|taken from space]].\n\n===Material culture and technology===\n{{Main|Tool|Technology}}\n[[File:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=Clark1994>{{cite journal |author1=Clark, J.D. |author2=de Heinzelin, J. |author3=Schick, K.D. |title=African ''Homo erectus'': old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia |journal=Science |year=1994 |volume=264 |issue=5167 |pages=1907\u201310 |pmid=8009220 |doi=10.1126/science.8009220|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1994Sci...264.1907C }}</ref> The [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled use of fire]] began around 1.5&nbsp;million years ago.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes ethics and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\n{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}\n\nReligion is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief. Some religions also have a [[moral code]]. The [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolution]] and the history of the [[Evolutionary origin of religions|first religions]] have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/ |title=Evolutionary Religious Studies: A New Field of Scientific Inquiry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171221/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/ |archivedate=17 August 2009  }}</ref><ref name=Boyer2008>{{cite journal |author=Boyer, Pascal |title=Being human: Religion: bound to believe? |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1038\u201339 |year=2008 |pmid=18948934 |doi=10.1038/4551038a|bibcode=2008Natur.455.1038B }}</ref><ref name=Emmons2003>{{Cite journal |author1=Emmons, Robert A. |author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The psychology of religion |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year=2003 |pmid=12171998 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=377\u2013402 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024}}</ref> However, in the course of its [[development of religion|development]], religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an [[afterlife]]), the [[origin of life]], the nature of the [[universe]] ([[religious cosmology]]) and its [[ultimate fate]] ([[eschatology]]), and what is [[morality|moral]] or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] divine beings such as [[deities]] or a singular God, although not all religions are [[theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.\n\nAlthough the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author1=Hall, Daniel E. |author2=Meador, Keith G. |author3=Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134\u201363 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are [[irreligious]]. This includes humans who have no religious beliefs or do not identify with any religion. [[Humanism]] is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to humans; it is usually non-religious. Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the [[philosophy of religion]] and theology.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Art, music, and literature===\n{{Main|Art|Music|Literature}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Lorenzo Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Allegory of Music'' ({{circa}} 1594), a painting of a woman writing [[sheet music]] by [[Lorenzo Lippi]]]]\n\nHumans have been producing [[art]] works for at least seventy-three thousand years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/science/oldest-drawing-ever-found.html|title=Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave|last=St. Fleur|first=Nicholas|date=12 September 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref> Art may be defined as a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries.

In the modern use of the word, art is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works that, from concept to creation, adhere to the \"creative impulse\" of human beings.\n\nMusic is a natural [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] phenomenon based on the three distinct and interrelated organization structures of rhythm, harmony, and melody. Listening to music is perhaps the most common and universal form of entertainment, while learning and understanding it are popular [[discipline]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} There are a wide variety of [[music genre]]s and [[ethnic music]]s.

The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the [[Middle Paleolithic]], about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia, the fossils of Herto sometimes classified as ''[[Homo sapiens idaltu]]'' also from Ethiopia. Earlier remains, now classified as \"archaic\" or \"early\" ''Homo sapiens'', such as the [[Jebel Irhoud]] remains from Morocco and the [[Florisbad Skull]] from South Africa, had also previously been classified by some researchers as belonging to an earlier subspecies ''H. helmei''\u2019.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=27298468|pmc=4920294|year=2016|last1=Stringer|first1=C.|title=The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Rise of ''Homo sapiens''===\n[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|World map of early human migrations according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] (numbers are [[millennia]] before present, the North Pole is at the center).]]\n{{main|Homo sapiens}}\n{{see|Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Early human migrations|Multiregional origin of modern humans|Prehistoric autopsy|Recent African origin of modern humans}}\nBy the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), and likely significantly earlier by 100\u201370,000 years ago<ref name=\"McBrearty Brooks 2000\" /><ref name=\"Henshilwood Marean 2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The comparatively minor anatomical differences between humans and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are largely a result of human [[bipedalism]] and larger brain size.

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. Human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it provides an evolutionary advantage of more caring time to relatives' young.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nApart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in [[smelling]], [[hearing]], [[digesting]] [[protein]]s, [[brain size]], and the ability of [[language]]. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. More importantly, the brain to body ratio is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed [[cerebral cortex]], with a larger number of [[neurons]]. The mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. Humans' ability of [[speech]] is unique among primates. Humans are able to create new and complex [[idea]]s, and to develop technology, which is unprecedented among other [[organism]]s on [[Earth]].<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nIt is estimated that the worldwide average [[Human height|height for an adult human]] male is about {{Height|cm=172}},{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about {{Height|cm=158}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals, but tends to be typical in the extremely [[Old age|aged]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Senior Citizens Do Shrink \u2013 Just One of the Body Changes of Aging |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-28-SeniorsDoShrink.htm |work=News |publisher=Senior Journal |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219004303/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-28-SeniorsDoShrink.htm |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df=}}</ref> Through history human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bogin B, Rios L |title=Rapid morphological change in living humans: implications for modern human origins |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201384 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14527631 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00294-5}}</ref> The average [[Body weight|mass]] of an adult human is {{Convert|54|-|64|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} for females and {{Convert|70|-|83|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} for males.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |title=Human weight |publisher=Articleworld.org |accessdate=10 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208053451/http://articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |archivedate=8 December 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlexSchlessingerman.shtml |title=Mass Of An Adult |publisher=The Physics Factbook: An Encyclopedia of Scientific Essays |accessdate=31 December 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030223/https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlexSchlessingerman.shtml |archivedate=1 January 2018  }}</ref> Like many other conditions, body weight and body type is influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.

During this process, the male inserts his [[erect penis]] into the female's [[vagina]] and [[ejaculate]]s semen, which contains sperm. The sperm travels through the vagina and cervix into the uterus or Fallopian tubes for [[human fertilization|fertilization]] of the ovum. Upon fertilization and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], gestation then occurs within the female's [[uterus]].\n\nThe [[zygote]] divides inside the female's uterus to become an [[embryo]], which over a period of 38 weeks (9 months) of [[gestation]] becomes a [[fetus]]. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is [[childbirth|birthed]] from the woman's body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of [[personhood]] earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.\n\nCompared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous.

While the [[nucleotide diversity|nucleotide]] genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%, the genetic difference between [[Man|males]] and [[woman|females]] is between 1% and 2%. The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and {{Convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} taller than females. There is a difference between body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. On average, men have about 40\u201350% more upper body strength and 20\u201330% more lower body strength than women. Women generally have a higher [[body fat]] percentage than men. Women have [[Human skin color#sexual dimorphism|lighter skin]] than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and [[lactation]]. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and [[Disease|disorders]] only affect either men or women.

Most human biological variation is [[Cline (biology)|clinally]] distributed and blends gradually from one area to the next. Groups of people around the world have different frequencies of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] genes. Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the strongest (e.g. [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are highly adapted to high altitudes). The clinal geographic genetic variation is further complicated by the migration and mixing between human populations which has been occurring since prehistoric times.<ref name=\"roberts1\"/><ref name=adapt3>{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Adapting to High Altitude |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm |work=Human Biological Adaptability |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106210055/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=adapt03>{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Overview |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_1.htm |work=Human Biological Adaptability |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306124405/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_1.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"vary02\">{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Models of Classification |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_2.htm |work=Modern Human Variation |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106212400/http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_2.htm |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"pbsmarks1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|title=Interview with Jonathan Marks|last=Marks|first=Jonathan|date=|work=Race \u2013 The Power of an Illusion|publisher=PBS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112143244/http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|archivedate=12 November 2012|accessdate=6 January 2013|layurl=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"pbsgoodman1\">{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Alan |title=Background Readings |url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-10.htm |work=Race \u2013 Power of an Illusion |publisher=PBS |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523034420/http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-10.htm |archivedate=23 May 2013  }}</ref>\n\nHuman variation is highly non-concordant: most of the genes do not cluster together and are not inherited together. Skin and hair color are not correlated to height, weight, or athletic ability. Human species do not share the same patterns of variation through geography. Skin color varies with latitude and certain people are tall or have brown hair. There is a statistical correlation between particular features in a population, but different features are not expressed or inherited together. Thus, genes which code for superficial physical traits\u2014such as skin color, hair color, or height\u2014represent a minuscule and insignificant portion of the human genome and do not correlate with genetic affinity.

Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.\n\nThe physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].\n\nThe nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. [[Psychologists]] have developed [[intelligence]] [[Test (assessment)|tests]] and the concept of [[intelligence quotient]] in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] among population.<ref>{{Britannica|289811|Intelligence test}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say \"I am conscious.\" Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says \"I am conscious of these words.\" Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well.

Furthermore, [[incentive]] and [[preference]] are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. [[Volition_(psychology)|Volition]] may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] of goals in an optimal manner, a [[Function_(biology)|function]] beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as [[socialization]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heckhausen, J.|author2=Heckhausen, H.|author-link= |date=28 March 2018|title=Motivation and Action|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1|location=Introduction and Overview|publisher=Springer, Cham|page=1|isbn=978-3-319-65093-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1}}</ref>\n\nHappiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have\u2014a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical health. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or society.\n\nEmotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as love, [[admiration]], or [[joy]], contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].\n\nIn modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.\n\n===Sexuality and love===\n{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]\nFor humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Sexual desire, or ''[[libido]]'', is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features, among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and (among great apes) a relatively large [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[human sperm competition|sperm competition in humans]], the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods.\n\nHuman choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by social norms which vary between cultures.

family-based social structures.]]\nHumans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. More than any other creature, humans are capable of using systems of communication for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from the size of families to nations. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety{{clarify|date=January 2014}} of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society.\n\nCulture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.\n\n===Language===\nWhile many species [[animal communication|communicate]], [[language]] is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a [[cultural universal]].

Human language also has the capacity of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.<ref name=\"Revolution\"/> Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is [[Origin of speech#Modality-independence|modality independent]]; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as [[braille]]. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including [[sign language]]s, and many thousands more that are [[extinct language|extinct]].<ref name=Comrie1996>{{cite book |author1=Comrie, Bernard |author2=Polinsky, Maria |author3=Matthews, Stephen |title=The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World |year=1996 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |pages=13\u201315 |isbn=978-0-8160-3388-1}}</ref>\n\n===Gender roles===\n{{Main|Gender role|Gender}}\nThe sexual division of humans into male, female, and in some societies other genders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/ |title=A Map of Gender-Diverse Cultures &#124; Independent Lens |publisher=PBS |date=11 August 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, [[practice (social theory)|practices]], dress, behavior, rights, [[duty|duties]], [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[social status|status]], and [[power (philosophy)|power]]. [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.\n\n===Kinship===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Kinship|Marriage}}\n[[File:thedragonpainter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sessue Hayakawa]] (left) with actress and wife [[Tsuru Aoki]] in a screen shot of the 1919 film ''[[The Dragon Painter]]''.]]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children ([[consanguinity]]), and relations through marriage ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited\u2014such rules vary widely between cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity ([[nurture kinship]]).\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Ethnic group}}\nHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>J.

Within a society people can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, [[power (social and political)|power]], [[reputation]], etc., but the structure of [[social stratification]] and the degree of [[social mobility]] differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |title=Social Stratification |last=Schizzerotto |first=Antonio |publisher=[[University of Trento]] |access-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150018/http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2018  }}</ref> A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized government, and possessing internal and external [[sovereignty]]. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved 17 March 2006.</ref>\n\nGovernment can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n\n===Trade and economics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Trade|Economics}}\n[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and sellers [[bargaining]] in a market in [[Tengeru]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economic activity]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a [[medium of exchange]], such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n\nEconomics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].\n\n===War===\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Men in period costume portraying soldiers during a 2011 reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815)]]\n{{Main|War}}\nWar is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others\u2014whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]\u2014to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].\n\nThere have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been [[space warfare|taken from space]].\n\n===Material culture and technology===\n{{Main|Tool|Technology}}\n[[File:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=Clark1994>{{cite journal |author1=Clark, J.D. |author2=de Heinzelin, J. |author3=Schick, K.D. |title=African ''Homo erectus'': old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia |journal=Science |year=1994 |volume=264 |issue=5167 |pages=1907\u201310 |pmid=8009220 |doi=10.1126/science.8009220|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1994Sci...264.1907C }}</ref> The [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled use of fire]] began around 1.5&nbsp;million years ago.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes ethics and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\n{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}\n\nReligion is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief.

A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] divine beings such as [[deities]] or a singular God, although not all religions are [[theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.\n\nAlthough the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author1=Hall, Daniel E. |author2=Meador, Keith G. |author3=Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134\u201363 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are [[irreligious]].

Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views.
