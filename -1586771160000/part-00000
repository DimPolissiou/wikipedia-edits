He is one of several authentic Slavic gods, mentioned by a number of medieval manuscripts, and one of the few Slavic gods for which evidence of worship can be found in all [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[tribes]].\n\n==Sources==\nDa\u017ebog (or Da\u017eboh) is mentioned in the [[Primary Chronicle]], a history of early [[Kievan Rus']] as one of seven gods whose statues Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] erected in front of his palace in [[Kiev]] in 980, when he came to the throne. The name is also mentioned in the [[Hypatian Codex]], as well as in the medieval Russian epic ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] reconstruction is [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/da\u010f\u044cbog\u044a|*dadj\u044cbog\u044a]],<ref name=\"ESSJa_4_182f\">\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.)

The original meaning of ''Da\u017ebog'' would thus, according to Dubenskij, Ognovskij and Niderle, be \"giving god\", \"god-giver, \"god-donor\".\n\nMorphologically this word is an old compound, that is particularly interesting because it retains the old meaning of the Proto-Slavic *bog\u044a \"earthly wealth/well-being; fortune\", with a semantic shift to \"dispenser of wealth/fortune\" and finally \"god\".<ref name=\"Skok_I_178\">Petar Skok (1971), Etimologijski rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika, JAZU: Zagreb, volume I, page 178ff</ref> Due to the absence of convincing cognates in other Indo-European languages, Proto-Slavic *bog\u044a is often considered to be an Iranian borrowing, being related to Indo-Iranian words such as Old Persian ''[[wikt:\ud800\udfb2\ud800\udfa5#Old Persian|baga]]'' and Sanskrit ''[[bhaga]]'', or at least being semantically influenced by them; in both Slavic and Indo-Iranian cognate forms mean both \"deity\" and \"wealth, share\".<ref>Compare OCS ''[[wikt:\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044a|bogat\u044a]]'' 'rich' as opposed to ''[[wikt:\u043e\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0433\u044a|ubog\u044a]]'' 'poor'.</ref> Thus, translated literally, ''Da\u017ebog'' would be \"dispenser of fortune\".\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:\u0414\u0430\u0436\u0431\u043e\u0433.1998\u0433.\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448.\u0442\u0435\u0445., \u0431\u0443\u043c.40,5\u044528.jpg|thumb|upright|Da\u017ebog (author: M. Presnyakov, 1998)]]\nThe most interesting passage about Da\u017ebog comes from the [[Hypatian Codex]], a 15th-century compilation of several much older documents from the [[Ipatiev Monastery]] in Russia. The complete passage, reconstructed from several manuscripts, translates as follows:\n\n<blockquote>(Then) began his reign Feosta ([[Hephaestus]]), whom the [[Egyptians]] called Svarog\u2026 during his rule, from the heavens fell the smith\u2019s prongs and weapons were forged for the first time; before that, (people) fought with clubs and stones. Feosta also commanded the women that they should have only a single husband\u2026 and that is why Egyptians called him Svarog\u2026 After him ruled his son, his name was the Sun, and they called him Da\u017ebog\u2026 Sun tzar, son of Svarog, this is Da\u017ebog.</blockquote>\n\nThis is in fact a Slavic translation of an original Greek manuscript of Malalin from the 6th century. In Greek text, the names of gods are [[Hephaestus]] and [[Helios]]. Apparently, the unknown Russian translator tried to re-tell the entire story (set in Egypt) by replacing the names of classical deities with those that were better known to his readers.<ref name=\"Belaj\">Vitomir Belaj \"Hod kroz godinu, mitska pozadina hrvatskih narodnih vjerovanja i obicaja\", Zagreb, 1998.</ref> One can only hope that he indeed replaced the names of Greek gods with their fitting Slavic counterparts; however, at least one issue remains problematic: in all Slavic languages, the word for Sun, ''Sunce'', is of neutral or feminine gender, never masculine (however, there is Russian epic character Vladimir Beautiful Sun<ref>[[:ru:\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}} which has the same place as Arthur in English culture.) Also, in [[Baltic mythology]], which is most akin to Slavic, Sun is a female deity, [[Saul\u0117|Saule]], while the Moon is a male one. The same pattern can be observed in folklore of many Slavic nations, where the Sun is most often identified with mother or a bride, and Moon with father or husband, their children being the stars. Where exactly this leaves Da\u017ebog as a possible male solar deity of Slavic pantheon remains questionable.\n\nFurthermore, this passage has raised quite a few theories about family relations between Slavic gods. If we assume that indeed [[Svarog]] was believed to be Da\u017ebog\u2019s father, the question arises of his relation with [[Svaro\u017ei\u010d]], another deity who is mentioned as god of fire and war in several other medieval documents describing the pagan beliefs of Slavs. Svaro\u017ei\u010d is simply a diminutive of Svarog\u2019s name, i.e., \"little Svarog\", which implicates he was considered a child of Svarog. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] proposed a reconstruction of this mythical genealogy that Svarog, a deity of fire and forge similar to the Greek [[Hephaestus]], had two sons; Da\u017ebog, who represented the fire in sky (i.e., the Sun), and Svaro\u017ei\u010d, who symbolised the flame on earth, in the forge.<ref name=\"Belaj\"/> [[Henryk \u0141owmia\u0144ski]], however, theorised that Svarog was a Slavic sky god and personification of daylight sky itself, possibly a continuation of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*[[Dy\u0113us]] Ph<sub>2</sub>ter'', while Svaro\u017ei\u010d and solar Da\u017ebog were one and the same deity, though, he concluded, two other aspects of Svaro\u017ei\u010d also existed: fiery Svaro\u017ei\u010d, as in the Sun (mentioned in Russian medieval manuscripts), and lunar Svaro\u017ei\u010d, associated with the Moon.<ref name=\"Lovmjanjski\">Henrik Lovmjanjski, Religija Slovena, Beograd 1996</ref> Franjo Ledic, on the other hand, simply assumed that Svarog and Da\u017ebog are one and the same god.<ref name=\"Ledic\">Franjo Ledi\u0107. Mitologija Slavena, vol. I, Zagreb, 1970.</ref>\n\nMany mythologists also believe Da\u017ebog to be identical with another East Slavic deity with possible solar attributes, [[Hors]]. [[Osip Maximovich Bodjanskij]] based this theory on a following passage from [[Primary Chronicle]]:\n\n<blockquote>And Vladimir began his reign in Kiev alone and erected idols on the hill outside his palace with porch: [[Perun]] of wood with a head of silver and mustache of gold and Hors Da\u017ebog and Stribog and Simargl and Mokosh.</blockquote>\n\nNote that the names Hors and Da\u017ebog are the only two not clearly separated by the word \"and\" in the text. This could be an indication of a compound deity, Hors Da\u017ebog. On this basis, Toporov assumed that Hors could be an Iranian (possibly Sarmatian or Scythian) name for this god, and Da\u017ebog a Slavic one. [[Boris Rybakov]] compared Hors and Da\u017ebog to [[Helios]] and [[Apollo]], respectively, concluding that both of them were solar gods, but while Hors represented the Sun itself, Da\u017ebog, as ''deus dator'', rather symbolised the life-giving power of the Sun.<ref name=\"Rybakov\">[[Boris Rybakov]]. ''Ancient Slavic Paganism''. Moscow, 1981</ref> That Hors was indeed a solar deity was deduced from the following passage in the \"Tale of Igor\u2019s campaign\":<ref name=\"Svarog\">[http://www.anita.f2o.org/ This f2o.org account is no longer in service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan. The path of great Hors, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed.</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, prince Vseslav reached [[Tmutarakan|Tmutorokan]] before dawn, thus crossing the path of Hors, the Sun. In the mythical view of the world, the Sun has to pass through the underworld during the night to reach the eastern horizon by the dawn. This, and the fact that prince Vseslav is transformed into a wolf during the night, while \"crossing the path of Hors\", draws a very interesting parallel with the Serbian Dabog, who, as stated already, was believed to be a lame \"wolf shepherd\" who rules over the underworld. Of particular interest is the fact that Serbian folk accounts describe him as being lame; lameness was a standing attribute of Greek Hephaestus, whom, as we have seen, the Hypatian Codex compared with Slavic smith-god Svarog, father of Da\u017ebog. (In fact, most of Indo-European smith-gods were lame; the reason for this was most likely [[Arsenic poisoning#Arsenicosis: chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking water|arsenicosis]], low levels of [[arsenic]] poisoning, resulting in lameness and [[skin cancer]]s. Arsenic was added to [[bronze]] to harden it and most smiths of the [[Bronze Age]] would have suffered from chronic workplace poisoning.) \n\nSerbian Dabog, being lord of underworld, was also associated with precious metals, and sometimes was said to have a silver beard.

He is one of several authentic Slavic gods, mentioned by a number of medieval manuscripts, and one of the few Slavic gods for which evidence of worship can be found in all [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[tribes]].\n\n==Sources==\nDa\u017ebog (or Da\u017eboh) is mentioned in the [[Primary Chronicle]], a history of early [[Kievan Rus']] as one of seven gods whose statues Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] erected in front of his palace in [[Kiev]] in 980, when he came to the throne. The name is also mentioned in the [[Hypatian Codex]], as well as in the medieval Russian epic ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] reconstruction is [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/da\u010f\u044cbog\u044a|*dadj\u044cbog\u044a]],<ref name=\"ESSJa_4_182f\">\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 (\u0440\u0435\u0434.)

The original meaning of ''Da\u017ebog'' would thus, according to Dubenskij, Ognovskij and Niderle, be \"giving god\", \"god-giver, \"god-donor\".\n\nMorphologically this word is an old compound, that is particularly interesting because it retains the old meaning of the Proto-Slavic *bog\u044a \"earthly wealth/well-being; fortune\", with a semantic shift to \"dispenser of wealth/fortune\" and finally \"god\".<ref name=\"Skok_I_178\">Petar Skok (1971), Etimologijski rje\u010dnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika, JAZU: Zagreb, volume I, page 178ff</ref> Due to the absence of convincing cognates in other Indo-European languages, Proto-Slavic *bog\u044a is often considered to be an Iranian borrowing, being related to Indo-Iranian words such as Old Persian ''[[wikt:\ud800\udfb2\ud800\udfa5#Old Persian|baga]]'' and Sanskrit ''[[bhaga]]'', or at least being semantically influenced by them; in both Slavic and Indo-Iranian cognate forms mean both \"deity\" and \"wealth, share\".<ref>Compare OCS ''[[wikt:\u0431\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044a|bogat\u044a]]'' 'rich' as opposed to ''[[wikt:\u043e\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0433\u044a|ubog\u044a]]'' 'poor'.</ref> Thus, translated literally, ''Da\u017ebog'' would be \"dispenser of fortune\".\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:\u0414\u0430\u0436\u0431\u043e\u0433.1998\u0433.\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448.\u0442\u0435\u0445., \u0431\u0443\u043c.40,5\u044528.jpg|thumb|upright|Da\u017ebog (author: M. Presnyakov, 1998)]]\nThe most interesting passage about Da\u017ebog comes from the [[Hypatian Codex]], a 15th-century compilation of several much older documents from the [[Ipatiev Monastery]] in Russia. The complete passage, reconstructed from several manuscripts, translates as follows:\n\n<blockquote>(Then) began his reign Feosta ([[Hephaestus]]), whom the [[Egyptians]] called Svarog\u2026 during his rule, from the heavens fell the smith\u2019s prongs and weapons were forged for the first time; before that, (people) fought with clubs and stones. Feosta also commanded the women that they should have only a single husband\u2026 and that is why Egyptians called him Svarog\u2026 After him ruled his son, his name was the Sun, and they called him Da\u017ebog\u2026 Sun tzar, son of Svarog, this is Da\u017ebog.</blockquote>\n\nThis is in fact a Slavic translation of an original Greek manuscript of Malalin from the 6th century. In Greek text, the names of gods are [[Hephaestus]] and [[Helios]]. Apparently, the unknown Russian translator tried to re-tell the entire story (set in Egypt) by replacing the names of classical deities with those that were better known to his readers.<ref name=\"Belaj\">Vitomir Belaj \"Hod kroz godinu, mitska pozadina hrvatskih narodnih vjerovanja i obicaja\", Zagreb, 1998.</ref> One can only hope that he indeed replaced the names of Greek gods with their fitting Slavic counterparts; however, at least one issue remains problematic: in all Slavic languages, the word for Sun, ''Sunce'', is of neutral or feminine gender, never masculine (however, there is Russian epic character Vladimir Beautiful Sun<ref>[[:ru:\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}} which has the same place as Arthur in English culture.) Also, in [[Baltic mythology]], which is most akin to Slavic, Sun is a female deity, [[Saul\u0117|Saule]], while the Moon is a male one. The same pattern can be observed in folklore of many Slavic nations, where the Sun is most often identified with mother or a bride, and Moon with father or husband, their children being the stars. Where exactly this leaves Da\u017ebog as a possible male solar deity of Slavic pantheon remains questionable.\n\nFurthermore, this passage has raised quite a few theories about family relations between Slavic gods. If we assume that indeed [[Svarog]] was believed to be Da\u017ebog\u2019s father, the question arises of his relation with [[Svaro\u017ei\u010d]], another deity who is mentioned as god of fire and war in several other medieval documents describing the pagan beliefs of Slavs. Svaro\u017ei\u010d is simply a diminutive of Svarog\u2019s name, i.e., \"little Svarog\", which implicates he was considered a child of Svarog. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] proposed a reconstruction of this mythical genealogy that Svarog, a deity of fire and forge similar to the Greek [[Hephaestus]], had two sons; Da\u017ebog, who represented the fire in sky (i.e., the Sun), and Svaro\u017ei\u010d, who symbolised the flame on earth, in the forge.<ref name=\"Belaj\"/> [[Henryk \u0141owmia\u0144ski]], however, theorised that Svarog was a Slavic sky god and personification of daylight sky itself, possibly a continuation of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*[[Dy\u0113us]] Ph<sub>2</sub>ter'', while Svaro\u017ei\u010d and solar Da\u017ebog were one and the same deity, though, he concluded, two other aspects of Svaro\u017ei\u010d also existed: fiery Svaro\u017ei\u010d, as in the Sun (mentioned in Russian medieval manuscripts), and lunar Svaro\u017ei\u010d, associated with the Moon.<ref name=\"Lovmjanjski\">Henrik Lovmjanjski, Religija Slovena, Beograd 1996</ref> Franjo Ledic, on the other hand, simply assumed that Svarog and Da\u017ebog are one and the same god.<ref name=\"Ledic\">Franjo Ledi\u0107. Mitologija Slavena, vol. I, Zagreb, 1970.</ref>\n\nMany mythologists also believe Da\u017ebog to be identical with another East Slavic deity with possible solar attributes, [[Hors]]. [[Osip Maximovich Bodjanskij]] based this theory on a following passage from [[Primary Chronicle]]:\n\n<blockquote>And Vladimir began his reign in Kiev alone and erected idols on the hill outside his palace with porch: [[Perun]] of wood with a head of silver and mustache of gold and Hors Da\u017ebog and Stribog and Simargl and Mokosh.</blockquote>\n\nNote that the names Hors and Da\u017ebog are the only two not clearly separated by the word \"and\" in the text. This could be an indication of a compound deity, Hors Da\u017ebog. On this basis, Toporov assumed that Hors could be an Iranian (possibly Sarmatian or Scythian) name for this god, and Da\u017ebog a Slavic one. [[Boris Rybakov]] compared Hors and Da\u017ebog to [[Helios]] and [[Apollo]], respectively, concluding that both of them were solar gods, but while Hors represented the Sun itself, Da\u017ebog, as ''deus dator'', rather symbolised the life-giving power of the Sun.<ref name=\"Rybakov\">[[Boris Rybakov]]. ''Ancient Slavic Paganism''. Moscow, 1981</ref> That Hors was indeed a solar deity was deduced from the following passage in the \"Tale of Igor\u2019s campaign\":<ref name=\"Svarog\">[http://www.anita.f2o.org/ This f2o.org account is no longer in service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan. The path of great Hors, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed.</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, prince Vseslav reached [[Tmutarakan|Tmutorokan]] before dawn, thus crossing the path of Hors, the Sun. In the mythical view of the world, the Sun has to pass through the underworld during the night to reach the eastern horizon by the dawn. This, and the fact that prince Vseslav is transformed into a wolf during the night, while \"crossing the path of Hors\", draws a very interesting parallel with the Serbian Dabog, who, as stated already, was believed to be a lame \"wolf shepherd\" who rules over the underworld. Of particular interest is the fact that Serbian folk accounts describe him as being lame; lameness was a standing attribute of Greek Hephaestus, whom, as we have seen, the Hypatian Codex compared with Slavic smith-god Svarog, father of Da\u017ebog. (In fact, most of Indo-European smith-gods were lame; the reason for this was most likely [[Arsenic poisoning#Arsenicosis: chronic arsenic poisoning from drinking water|arsenicosis]], low levels of [[arsenic]] poisoning, resulting in lameness and [[skin cancer]]s. Arsenic was added to [[bronze]] to harden it and most smiths of the [[Bronze Age]] would have suffered from chronic workplace poisoning.) \n\nSerbian Dabog, being lord of underworld, was also associated with precious metals, and sometimes was said to have a silver beard. [[Veselin \u010cajkanovi\u0107]] concluded that the [[chthonic]] character of Dabog in Serbian folklore fits very nicely with the solar Da\u017ebog mentioned in Russian sources, pointing out that in numerous mythologies, solar deities tend to have double aspects, one benevolent, associated with the Sun during the day, and the other malevolent, associated with night, when the Sun is trapped in the underworld. In his studies of Serbian folklore, \u010cajkanovi\u0107 also concluded that many more benevolent aspects of Da\u017ebog were passed on to popular saints in folk Christianity, in particularly onto [[St. Sava]], Serbian national saint, who, although undoubtedly was a real historical person, in folk tales often appears in the role of [[culture hero]].<ref name=\"Veselin\">Veselin \u010cajkanovi\u0107, Mit i religija u Srba, Beograd, 1973.</ref> The fact that in \u201cTale of Igor\u2019s campaign\u201d, the Russians and their princes are being referred to as \u2018\u2019Da\u017ebog\u2019s grandchildren\u2019\u2019, indicates that Da\u017ebog was considered as an ancestral deity, a common role of a culture hero archetype in mythologies.\n\n== The god in modern culture ==\nA sculpture of the god was erected in [[Hola Prystan]], [[Ukraine]] early in 2001.

'Gunditjmara' was, he argues, used only in the context of specific clan naming. {{harv|Blake|2003|p=2}}}} or '''Gunditjamara''',{{efn|[[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|AIATSIS]] gives this spelling on their website. {{harv|Indigenous Australians|2018}}}}  are an [[Aboriginal Australian]] people of southwestern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They are the traditional owners of the areas now encompassing [[Warrnambool]], [[Port Fairy]], [[Woolsthorpe, Victoria|Woolsthorpe]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]]. Their land includes much of the [[Budj Bim heritage areas]].\n\nThe '''Kerrup Jmara''' ('''Kerrupjmara''', '''Kerrup-Jmara''') are a clan of the Gunditjmara, whose traditional lands are around [[Lake Condah]]. The '''Koroitgundidj''' ('''Koroit gundidj''') are another clan group, whose lands are around [[Tower Hill (volcano)|Tower Hill]].\n\n==Name==\nGunditjmara is formed from two words ''Gunditj'' an affix signifying 'belonging' and ''mara'', their word for an aboriginal person of that area.{{efn|It was reported that this was one of four terms (the other 3 being ''Koondoom''(water) ''karrup''(lake) and ''tyarrk'' (swamp)) designating [[Condah|Lake Condah]].{{sfn|Howitt|1904|p=69}} However the report from 1880 arguably garbled information from an Aboriginal informant. {{harv|Clark|2014b|p=245}}}}\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Kuurn Kopan Noot language}}\nThe [[Dhauwurd wurrung language]] is classified as one of the dialects of the Kuurn Kopan Noot language|Bungandeik/Kuurn-Kopan-Noot subgroup of Victorian languages.{{sfn|Dixon|2002|p=xxxv}} It consisted of five subdialects: ''Wullu wurrung, Gai wurrung, Gurngubanud, Peek wurrung'', and ''Dhauwurd wurrung''.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}}{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=2}} The language in its several varieties, was spoken from [[Shire of Glenelg|Glenelg]] to the [[Gellibrand River|Gellibrand]] and through to roughly {{convert|60|miles}} inland.{{sfn|Blake|2003|pp=xiii, 2}} Other generic terms for this linguistic complex refer to it as ''Kiriwurrung'' (Keerraywoorroong) or the Warnambool (Warrnambool) language.{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=2}} Only three speakers were known to speak the language still by 1880, with another 4 still fluent in the ''Peek wurrung'' dialect.{{sfn|Dawson|1881|p=4}} They had a form of [[avoidance speech]] called ''gnee wee banott'' (turn tongue) which required special terms and grammar in conversations when a man and mother-in-law were speaking in each other's company.{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=8}}\nThus, if one asked: 'Where are you going just now?'\nThis would be phrased in normal speech as:\n* ''Wuunda gnin kitneean?''\n\nIn Gunditjmara avoidance speech the same sentiment would be articulated quite differently:\n* ''Wuun gni gnin gninkeewan?''{{sfn|Dawson|1881|p=29}}\n\n==Country==\nThe Gunditjmara tribal territories extends over an estimated {{convert|2700|mi2|km2}}. The western boundaries are around [[Cape Bridgewater]] and [[Condah|Lake Condah]]. Northwards they reach [[Caramut, Victoria|Caramut]] and [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]]. Their eastern boundaries lay around the [[Hopkins River]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=204}}{{efn|Howitt writes that their nation:'extended from the southern limits of the Muk-jarawaint to the sea, and from Mt Gambier to the Eumerella Creek, and included the Kuurn-kopan-noot and Peek-whuurrung tribes, described by Mr Dawson' {{harv|Howitt|1904|=69}}}} Their neighbours to the west are the [[Bungandidj people|Buandig]] people, to the north the [[Jardwadjali]] and [[Djab wurrung]] peoples, and in the east the [[Girai wurrung]] people. Early settlers remarked on the richness of the game to be found from the Eumerella Creek down to the coast.{{efn|\"All the land that lay between Eumeralla proper and the sea, a tract of country of some twenty or thirty miles square, had been probably from time immemorial a great hunting-ground and rendezvous for the surrounding tribes. It was no doubt eminently fitted for such a purpose. It swarmed with game, and in the spring was one immense preserve of every kind of wild fowl and wild animal that the country owned.\" {{harv|Boldrewood|1896|p=63}}}}\n\n==Way of life==\nThe way of life of the Aboriginal people of [[Western Victoria]] differed from other [[Aboriginal Victorians]] in several respects. Because of the colder climate, they made, wore, and used as blankets, rugs of [[Phalangeridae|possum]] and [[kangaroo]]. They also built huts from wood and local [[basalt]] (known as [[bluestone]]), with roofs made of [[turf roof|turf]] and branches.{{sfn|''The Sydney Morning Herald''|2004}}\n\n==Dreaming==\n{{further|Dreamtime}}\nThe Gunditjmara believe that the landscape's features mark out the traces of a creator, [[Budj Bim|Budj Bim (lit.'High Head')]], who emerged in the form of the volcano now called [[Mount Eccles National Park|Mt Eccles]]. In a spate of eruption, the lava flows, constituting his blood and teeth, spilled over the landscape, fashioning its wetlands. 'High Head' still refers to the crater's brow, which can be accessed only by Gunditjmara men wearing special emu-feather footwear.{{sfn|Chai|2017}}\nOpposite, beyond the coastline, the island they call [[Lady Julia Percy Island|Deen Maar/Dhinmar]]{{sfn|Mathews|1904|p=297}} held special value for its burial associations. A cave there, known as ''Tarn wirrung'' ('road of the spirits'), is thought of as the mouth of a passage linking the mainland and the island.\n\nIn Gunditjmara funeral rites, bodies are enfolded in grass bundles and interred with their heads pointing to the island, with an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] firebrand of [[Exocarpos cupressiformis|native cherry wood]]. If grass was thereafter found outside the mouth of Tarn wirrung, it was regarded as evidence that the good spirit ''Puit puit chepetch'' had conveyed the corpse via the subterranean passage to the island, while guiding its spirit to the realm of the clouds. If the burial coincided with the appearance of a meteor, this was read as proof that the being in transit to the heavens had been furnished with fire. If grass was found at the cave when no one had been buried, then it was thought it showed someone had been murdered, and the cave could not be approached until the grass had been dispersed.{{sfn|Dawson|1881|pp=51\u201352}}{{efn|'These tribes, like those in the Wimmera River district, have a spirit-home, which is called ''maioga''  in some of the dialects, and ''mung'-o'' in others. All the clans have the same maioga, which consists of an island a short distance off the coast of Victoria, about half way between Warrnambool and Portland. The native name of this island is Dhinmar, but it is known on the map as Lady Julia Percy Island. On the shore of the mainland facing the island there are some large rocks, into the base of one of which the ceaseless rolling of the billows has worn a cavelike recess, respecting which the natives have a superstitious belief that it is in some way connected with Dhinmar. Every deceased person, when buried, is laid with his head pointing towards this island. His spirit then provides itself with a firebrand, consisting of a piece of dry cherry tree, because this wood emits a peculiar odour whilst burning, which has the power of warding off danger from the bearer. The spectre then proceeds to the shore where the rock is situated, where he divests himself of any clothing or trinkets he may be wearing on his body, and disappears over the intervening sea to Dhinmar. The spirits of all the clans and phratries go to this island, which they occupy in common, the same as they did in their native hunting grounds. There they remain until reincarnated. {{harv|Mathews|1904|p=297}}}}\n\n==Social organisation==\nThe Gunditjmara were divided into 59 clans, each with its headmen (''wungit''), a role passed on by hereditary transmission.{{sfn|Builth|2009|pp=27\u201328}} They spoke distinct dialects,{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}} not all of them mutually intelligible,{{sfn|Clark|1998|p=70}} with the three main [[Band society|hordes]] located around [[Lake Condah]], [[Port Fairy]] and [[Woolsthorpe, Victoria|Woolsthorpe]] respectively.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=204}} The Gunditjmara groups are divided into two [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|moieties]], respectively the ''grugidj'' ([[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] or [[Long-billed corella]]) and the ''gabadj''  ([[Red-tailed black cockatoo]],{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}} the latter once thriving in [[Allocasuarina luehmannii|buloke]] woodlands, now mainly cleared.{{efn|The variety of red-tailed black cockatoo indigenous to an enclave in south western Victoria is now recognized as a distinct species, Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne. {{harv|Australian Endangered Species|2007}}}}\n\nAccording to [[Alfred William Howitt]], they had four sections, which however did not affect marriage rules:\n* ''kerup''   (water)\n* ''boom''   (mountain)\n* ''direk''   (swamp)\n* ''gilger''   (river)\n\nHowever these terms refer to 4 of the 58 clans.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nDescent was [[matrilineal]].{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}}\n\n===Clans===\nThe following is a list of the Gunditjmara clans (''conedeet''),{{efn|''conedeet'' is a term, meaning something like 'belonging to', found only in clan names, thus ''Cart conedeet marr'' would be 'an (Aboriginal) man(''marr'') belonging to (''conedeet'') the ''Cart gundidj'' (see 10 below).{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=2}} According to James Dawson, ''conedeet'', properly to be transcribed as ''kuurndit'', functioned like the suffix ''-er'' in words like London''er'', meaning 'belonging to.'.{{sfn|Dawson|1881|p=2}} It was one of a series of terms among Australian [[band society|band societies]], like ''bulluc'' and ''corroke'', affixed to a prominent [[toponym]], and serving to indicate the locality a band was associated with. {{harv|Peterson|Long|1986|p=47}}}} taken from that in [[Ian D.

[[Peter Coutts]] and others argued, in a work entitled ''Aboriginal Engineers of the Western District, Victoria,'' that numerous features show the handiwork of Aboriginal landscaping for economic purposes.{{sfn|Coutts|Frank|Hughes|Vanderwal|1978}} This thesis was challenged as a mythical \"romancing of the landscape\" by Anne Clarke, one that confused natural processes with socially crafted infrastructure.{{sfn|Hiscock|2007|p=253}} However, fresh archaeological work by [[Heather Builth]] led to her contending that they had a sophisticated system of [[aquaculture]] and [[fish farming|eel farming]]. They built stone dams to hold the water in these [[swamp]]y volcanic areas, especially the area comprising the [[lava flow]] of the ''[[Budj Bim]]'' volcano, creating ponds and [[wetland]]s in which they harvested short-finned eels (''kuyang'' or more commonly ''kooyang''{{sfn|UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}){{sfn|Chai|2017}}{{sfn|Blake|2003|pp=16,20}}{{efn|Another word for eel exists, ''kakong''. {{harv|Blake|2003|p=184}}}}.\n\nThe Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape, which includes both the Tyrendarra Area and the Mt Eccles \u2013 Lake Condah Area, comprising [[Budj Bim National Park]] (formerly Mt Eccles National Park), Stones State Faunal Reserve, Muldoons Aboriginal Land, Allambie Aboriginal Land and [[Condah Mission]]) was added to the [[National Heritage List]] on 20 July 2004,{{sfn|Dept of Agriculture, Water and the Environment}} under the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''.{{sfn|Government Gazette|2004}}\n\nSeveral designated areas comprising the [[Budj Bim Cultural Landscape]] were added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] in 2019.{{sfn|UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}\nIn the wake of [[2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season|the burning of some 7,000 hectares]] of bushland around Lake Condah and in the Budj Bim National Park, further channel structures came to light.{{sfn|Johnson|2020b}}\n\nThey also created channels linking these wetlands.

'had been for untold generations accustomed to a dietary scale of exceptional liberality.

Significantly, this is a \"minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria\", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the Gunditjmara [[oral histories]] which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest [[oral tradition]]s in existence.{{sfn|Matchan|Phillips|Jourdan|Oostingh|2020}} An axe found underneath [[volcanic ash]] in 1947 was also proof that humans inhabited the region before the eruption of Tower Hill.{{sfn|Johnson|2020a}}\n\nThe beginnings of contact with ''ngamadjidj'' (white people) date as far back as 1810, when [[Whaling in Australia|whalers]] and [[Seal hunting|sealers]] began to use Portland as a base area for their operations. Contact exposed the local people to epidemics from new diseases born by whites but otherwise was seasonal, and allowed time for demographic recovery.\n\nThe major turn in relations occurred with the arrival of, and settlement of their lands by, the [[Henty Brothers]] from 1834 onwards.{{efn|[[Edward Henty]] came ashore at Portland on 19 November of that year. {{harv|Clark|1995|p=22}}}}{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}} Though much silence surrounded the massacres that took place, and, despite Boldrerwood's explicit testimony,{{efn|Like all guerillas, moreover, their act of outrage took place sometimes in one part of a large district, sometimes in another, the actors vanishing meanwhile, and reappearing with puzzling rapidity. {{harv|Boldrewood|1896|p=67}}}} some early historians dismissed the idea of a guerilla war.{{efn|Henry Giles Turner wrote in 1904 after citing the highly laudatory opinion of Western district aborigines registered by [[James Dawson (activist)|James Dawson]] who dwelt in the midst of the conflict but never suffered aggression because he treated indigenous people fairly:'The wars which our American cousins waged for two hundred years against the brave and crafty redskins; the long struggles in Canada against the confederated six nations; the storming by British troops of native Pahs in New Zealand; the protracted wars, costly in blood and treasure, involved in the subjugation of the kaffirs and Zulus in South Africa; nay, even the more circumscribed, but still bloody \"Black War\" in Tasmania, had no counterpart in the settlement of the colony of Victoria. The reason is not far to seek, and it does not necessarily imply any want of courage on the part of the invaded. They were comparatively few in number, and they were dispersed in small tribes over a large area of country.

'Gunditjmara' was, he argues, used only in the context of specific clan naming. {{harv|Blake|2003|p=2}}}} or '''Gunditjamara''',{{efn|[[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|AIATSIS]] gives this spelling on their website. {{harv|Indigenous Australians|2018}}}}  are an [[Aboriginal Australian]] people of southwestern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They are the traditional owners of the areas now encompassing [[Warrnambool]], [[Port Fairy]], [[Woolsthorpe, Victoria|Woolsthorpe]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]]. Their land includes much of the [[Budj Bim heritage areas]].\n\nThe '''Kerrup Jmara''' ('''Kerrupjmara''', '''Kerrup-Jmara''') are a clan of the Gunditjmara, whose traditional lands are around [[Lake Condah]]. The '''Koroitgundidj''' ('''Koroit gundidj''') are another clan group, whose lands are around [[Tower Hill (volcano)|Tower Hill]].\n\n==Name==\nGunditjmara is formed from two words ''Gunditj'' an affix signifying 'belonging' and ''mara'', their word for an aboriginal person of that area.{{efn|It was reported that this was one of four terms (the other 3 being ''Koondoom''(water) ''karrup''(lake) and ''tyarrk'' (swamp)) designating [[Condah|Lake Condah]].{{sfn|Howitt|1904|p=69}} However the report from 1880 arguably garbled information from an Aboriginal informant. {{harv|Clark|2014b|p=245}}}}\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Kuurn Kopan Noot language}}\nThe [[Dhauwurd wurrung language]] is classified as one of the dialects of the Kuurn Kopan Noot language|Bungandeik/Kuurn-Kopan-Noot subgroup of Victorian languages.{{sfn|Dixon|2002|p=xxxv}} It consisted of five subdialects: ''Wullu wurrung, Gai wurrung, Gurngubanud, Peek wurrung'', and ''Dhauwurd wurrung''.{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}}{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=2}} The language in its several varieties, was spoken from [[Shire of Glenelg|Glenelg]] to the [[Gellibrand River|Gellibrand]] and through to roughly {{convert|60|miles}} inland.{{sfn|Blake|2003|pp=xiii, 2}} Other generic terms for this linguistic complex refer to it as ''Kiriwurrung'' (Keerraywoorroong) or the Warnambool (Warrnambool) language.{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=2}} Only three speakers were known to speak the language still by 1880, with another 4 still fluent in the ''Peek wurrung'' dialect.{{sfn|Dawson|1881|p=4}} They had a form of [[avoidance speech]] called ''gnee wee banott'' (turn tongue) which required special terms and grammar in conversations when a man and mother-in-law were speaking in each other's company.{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=8}}\nThus, if one asked: 'Where are you going just now?'\nThis would be phrased in normal speech as:\n* ''Wuunda gnin kitneean?''\n\nIn Gunditjmara avoidance speech the same sentiment would be articulated quite differently:\n* ''Wuun gni gnin gninkeewan?''{{sfn|Dawson|1881|p=29}}\n\n==Country==\nThe Gunditjmara tribal territories extends over an estimated {{convert|2700|mi2|km2}}. The western boundaries are around [[Cape Bridgewater]] and [[Condah|Lake Condah]]. Northwards they reach [[Caramut, Victoria|Caramut]] and [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]]. Their eastern boundaries lay around the [[Hopkins River]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=204}}{{efn|Howitt writes that their nation:'extended from the southern limits of the Muk-jarawaint to the sea, and from Mt Gambier to the Eumerella Creek, and included the Kuurn-kopan-noot and Peek-whuurrung tribes, described by Mr Dawson' {{harv|Howitt|1904|=69}}}} Their neighbours to the west are the [[Bungandidj people|Buandig]] people, to the north the [[Jardwadjali]] and [[Djab wurrung]] peoples, and in the east the [[Girai wurrung]] people. Early settlers remarked on the richness of the game to be found from the Eumerella Creek down to the coast.{{efn|\"All the land that lay between Eumeralla proper and the sea, a tract of country of some twenty or thirty miles square, had been probably from time immemorial a great hunting-ground and rendezvous for the surrounding tribes. It was no doubt eminently fitted for such a purpose. It swarmed with game, and in the spring was one immense preserve of every kind of wild fowl and wild animal that the country owned.\" {{harv|Boldrewood|1896|p=63}}}}\n\n==Way of life==\nThe way of life of the Aboriginal people of [[Western Victoria]] differed from other [[Aboriginal Victorians]] in several respects. Because of the colder climate, they made, wore, and used as blankets, rugs of [[Phalangeridae|possum]] and [[kangaroo]]. They also built huts from wood and local [[basalt]] (known as [[bluestone]]), with roofs made of [[turf roof|turf]] and branches.{{sfn|''The Sydney Morning Herald''|2004}}\n\n==Dreaming==\n{{further|Dreamtime}}\nThe Gunditjmara believe that the landscape's features mark out the traces of a creator, [[Budj Bim|Budj Bim (lit.'High Head')]], who emerged in the form of the volcano now called [[Mount Eccles National Park|Mt Eccles]]. In a spate of eruption, the lava flows, constituting his blood and teeth, spilled over the landscape, fashioning its wetlands. 'High Head' still refers to the crater's brow, which can be accessed only by Gunditjmara men wearing special emu-feather footwear.{{sfn|Chai|2017}}\nOpposite, beyond the coastline, the island they call [[Lady Julia Percy Island|Deen Maar/Dhinmar]]{{sfn|Mathews|1904|p=297}} held special value for its burial associations. A cave there, known as ''Tarn wirrung'' ('road of the spirits'), is thought of as the mouth of a passage linking the mainland and the island.\n\nIn Gunditjmara funeral rites, bodies are enfolded in grass bundles and interred with their heads pointing to the island, with an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] firebrand of [[Exocarpos cupressiformis|native cherry wood]]. If grass was thereafter found outside the mouth of Tarn wirrung, it was regarded as evidence that the good spirit ''Puit puit chepetch'' had conveyed the corpse via the subterranean passage to the island, while guiding its spirit to the realm of the clouds. If the burial coincided with the appearance of a meteor, this was read as proof that the being in transit to the heavens had been furnished with fire. If grass was found at the cave when no one had been buried, then it was thought it showed someone had been murdered, and the cave could not be approached until the grass had been dispersed.{{sfn|Dawson|1881|pp=51\u201352}}{{efn|'These tribes, like those in the Wimmera River district, have a spirit-home, which is called ''maioga''  in some of the dialects, and ''mung'-o'' in others. All the clans have the same maioga, which consists of an island a short distance off the coast of Victoria, about half way between Warrnambool and Portland. The native name of this island is Dhinmar, but it is known on the map as Lady Julia Percy Island. On the shore of the mainland facing the island there are some large rocks, into the base of one of which the ceaseless rolling of the billows has worn a cavelike recess, respecting which the natives have a superstitious belief that it is in some way connected with Dhinmar. Every deceased person, when buried, is laid with his head pointing towards this island. His spirit then provides itself with a firebrand, consisting of a piece of dry cherry tree, because this wood emits a peculiar odour whilst burning, which has the power of warding off danger from the bearer. The spectre then proceeds to the shore where the rock is situated, where he divests himself of any clothing or trinkets he may be wearing on his body, and disappears over the intervening sea to Dhinmar. The spirits of all the clans and phratries go to this island, which they occupy in common, the same as they did in their native hunting grounds. There they remain until reincarnated. {{harv|Mathews|1904|p=297}}}}\n\n==Social organisation==\nThe Gunditjmara were divided into 59 clans, each with its headmen (''wungit''), a role passed on by hereditary transmission.{{sfn|Builth|2009|pp=27\u201328}} They spoke distinct dialects,{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}} not all of them mutually intelligible,{{sfn|Clark|1998|p=70}} with the three main [[Band society|hordes]] located around [[Lake Condah]], [[Port Fairy]] and [[Woolsthorpe, Victoria|Woolsthorpe]] respectively.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=204}} The Gunditjmara groups are divided into two [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|moieties]], respectively the ''grugidj'' ([[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] or [[Long-billed corella]]) and the ''gabadj''  ([[Red-tailed black cockatoo]],{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}} the latter once thriving in [[Allocasuarina luehmannii|buloke]] woodlands, now mainly cleared.{{efn|The variety of red-tailed black cockatoo indigenous to an enclave in south western Victoria is now recognized as a distinct species, Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne. {{harv|Australian Endangered Species|2007}}}}\n\nAccording to [[Alfred William Howitt]], they had four sections, which however did not affect marriage rules:\n* ''kerup''   (water)\n* ''boom''   (mountain)\n* ''direk''   (swamp)\n* ''gilger''   (river)\n\nHowever these terms refer to 4 of the 58 clans.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nDescent was [[matrilineal]].{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}}\n\n===Clans===\nThe following is a list of the Gunditjmara clans (''conedeet''),{{efn|''conedeet'' is a term, meaning something like 'belonging to', found only in clan names, thus ''Cart conedeet marr'' would be 'an (Aboriginal) man(''marr'') belonging to (''conedeet'') the ''Cart gundidj'' (see 10 below).{{sfn|Blake|2003|p=2}} According to James Dawson, ''conedeet'', properly to be transcribed as ''kuurndit'', functioned like the suffix ''-er'' in words like London''er'', meaning 'belonging to.'.{{sfn|Dawson|1881|p=2}} It was one of a series of terms among Australian [[band society|band societies]], like ''bulluc'' and ''corroke'', affixed to a prominent [[toponym]], and serving to indicate the locality a band was associated with. {{harv|Peterson|Long|1986|p=47}}}} taken from that in [[Ian D.

[[Peter Coutts]] and others argued, in a work entitled ''Aboriginal Engineers of the Western District, Victoria,'' that numerous features show the handiwork of Aboriginal landscaping for economic purposes.{{sfn|Coutts|Frank|Hughes|Vanderwal|1978}} This thesis was challenged as a mythical \"romancing of the landscape\" by Anne Clarke, one that confused natural processes with socially crafted infrastructure.{{sfn|Hiscock|2007|p=253}} However, fresh archaeological work by [[Heather Builth]] led to her contending that they had a sophisticated system of [[aquaculture]] and [[fish farming|eel farming]]. They built stone dams to hold the water in these [[swamp]]y volcanic areas, especially the area comprising the [[lava flow]] of the ''[[Budj Bim]]'' volcano, creating ponds and [[wetland]]s in which they harvested short-finned eels (''kuyang'' or more commonly ''kooyang''{{sfn|UNESCO World Heritage Centre}} ){{sfn|Chai|2017}}{{sfn|Blake|2003|pp=16,20}}{{efn|Another word for eel exists, ''kakong''. {{harv|Blake|2003|p=184}}}}.\n\nThe Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape, which includes both the Tyrendarra Area and the Mt Eccles \u2013 Lake Condah Area, comprising [[Budj Bim National Park]] (formerly Mt Eccles National Park), Stones State Faunal Reserve, Muldoons Aboriginal Land, Allambie Aboriginal Land and [[Condah Mission]]) was added to the [[National Heritage List]] on 20 July 2004,{{sfn|Dept of Agriculture, Water and the Environment}} under the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''.{{sfn|Government Gazette|2004}}\n\nSeveral designated areas comprising the [[Budj Bim Cultural Landscape]] were added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] in 2019.{{sfn|UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}\nIn the wake of [[2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season|the burning of some 7,000 hectares]] of bushland around Lake Condah and in the Budj Bim National Park, further channel structures came to light.{{sfn|Johnson|2020b}}\n\nThey also created channels linking these wetlands.

'had been for untold generations accustomed to a dietary scale of exceptional liberality. The climate was temperate; the forests abounded in game; wild fowl at certain seasons were plentiful; while the sea supplied them with fish of all sorts and sizes, from a whale (stranded) to a whitebait'. {{harv|Clark|2011}}}}\n\n==History==\nIn a study published in February 2020, new evidence produced by using a form of [[radiometric dating]] known as [[argon-argon dating]], showed that both [[Budj Bim]] and [[Tower Hill (volcano)|Tower Hill]] volcanoes erupted at least 34,000 years ago.{{sfn|Johnson|2020a}} Specifically, Budj Bim was dated at within 3,100 years either side of 36,900 years [[before present|BP]], and Tower Hill was dated at within 3,800 years either side of 36,800 years [[before present|BP]].

Contact exposed the local people to epidemics from new diseases born by whites but otherwise was seasonal, and allowed time for demographic recovery.\n\nThe major turn in relations occurred with the arrival of, and settlement of their lands by, the [[Henty Brothers]] from 1834 onwards.{{efn|[[Edward Henty]] came ashore at Portland on 19 November of that year. {{harv|Clark|1995|p=22}}}}{{sfn|Clark|1995|p=11}} Though much silence surrounded the massacres that took place, and, despite Boldrerwood's explicit testimony,{{efn|Like all guerillas, moreover, their act of outrage took place sometimes in one part of a large district, sometimes in another, the actors vanishing meanwhile, and reappearing with puzzling rapidity. {{harv|Boldrewood|1896|p=67}}}} some early historians dismissed the idea of a guerilla war.{{efn|Henry Giles Turner wrote in 1904 after citing the highly laudatory opinion of Western district aborigines registered by [[James Dawson (activist)|James Dawson]] who dwelt in the midst of the conflict but never suffered aggression because he treated indigenous people fairly:'The wars which our American cousins waged for two hundred years against the brave and crafty redskins; the long struggles in Canada against the confederated six nations; the storming by British troops of native Pahs in New Zealand; the protracted wars, costly in blood and treasure, involved in the subjugation of the kaffirs and Zulus in South Africa; nay, even the more circumscribed, but still bloody \"Black War\" in Tasmania, had no counterpart in the settlement of the colony of Victoria. The reason is not far to seek, and it does not necessarily imply any want of courage on the part of the invaded. They were comparatively few in number, and they were dispersed in small tribes over a large area of country.
