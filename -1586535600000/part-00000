Together they produced a self-released demo tape, ''Black Winds'', in 1991.\n\nIn 1992, Enthrone changed its name to \"Carpathian Forest\", and Lord Blackmangler and Damnatus joined their line-up. As a quartet they self-released three demo tapes: ''Rehearsal Outtake'', ''Bloodlust and Perversion'' (both in 1992) and ''Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern'' (in 1993). However, Damnatus and Lord Blackmangler left afterwards, and Carpathian Forest became once more a duo.\n\nCarpathian Forest would release their first studio work in 1995: the [[extended play]] ''[[Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods]]'', via [[Avantgarde Music]]. It would be their first of many releases via Avantgarde.\n\nIn 1998 the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Black Shining Leather]]'', once more via Avantgarde Music. It was their only release to feature [[Lars Nedland|Lazare]] (who would later join [[Borknagar]]) on the band's line-up as a drummer. In the same year they also played their first concert at the Under the Black Sun Festival in [[Sch\u00f6nermark]], [[Germany]].\n\nLazare left Carpathian Forest in 1999, the same year [[Anders Kobro]], [[Tchort]] and [[Vrangsinn|Daniel Vrangsinn]] joined them as permanent members. In the following year, their second full-length, ''[[Strange Old Brew]]'', was released. It was their most experimental album so far. By the end of the year they also released a single, \"He's Turning Blue\".\n\nIn 2001, founding member Nordavind left Carpathian Forest, during the recording sessions of their third studio album, ''[[Morbid Fascination of Death]]'', that still retained the experimentation (although to a lesser extent) of their previous release, ''Strange Old Brew''. In the following year the compilation album ''We're Going to Hell for This: Over a Decade of Perversions'' was released, in order to celebrate the band's 10th anniversary as Carpathian Forest. It was their last album to be released by Avantgarde Music before they switched on to [[Season of Mist]].\n\nTheir fourth full-length, ''[[Defending the Throne of Evil]]'', was released in 2003 by Season of Mist. Contrasting with Carpathian Forest's previous releases, it was their most melodic album so far, almost reminiscent of [[symphonic black metal]]. In late 2003 the band was joined by G\u00f8ran \"Blood Pervertor\" Bomann.\n\n2004 saw the release of a live DVD, ''We're Going to Hollywood for This'', and a compilation album featuring rarities and reworked versions of old Carpathian Forest songs, ''Skjend hans lik'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for \"Desecrate His Body\").\n\nCarpathian Forest's latest release was the 2006 studio album ''[[Fuck You All!!!! Caput tuum in ano est]]'', that was a throwback to their early, [[blackened thrash metal]]-like sonority of their debut.\n\nIn an early 2008 issue of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'', Tchort spoke about the possibility of a new album, and the rumors circulating regarding a \"half-finished album\". He is quoted as saying: \"I met with Nattefrost a few weeks ago and we decided to focus on a new album, but we haven't even started writing it yet. The news that we had an album half-finished was based on the fact that we had material left over from the last album. Since we record in different studios, this meant that I had the basics for music that Nattefrost never heard\". He also divulged that \"[we] kind of decided on a slightly new direction for the band, compared to ''Fuck You All'', at least\".\n\nThe band frontlined the [[Inferno Festival]] in 2009, and confirmed rumors that a new album was in the works.<ref name=\"Blabbermouth.net Carpathian Forest\">{{cite web|title=CARPATHIAN FOREST Working On New Album, DVD \u2013 Jan. 2, 2009 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=111746 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=10 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe band entered on a relative hiatus after 2009, but from 2012 onwards they began to play on some festivals around Europe.

McClusky''' or '''McCluskey''' (1861 &ndash; December 17, 1912) was an American law enforcement officer and [[police inspector]] in the [[New York City Police Department]]. He was popularly known as \"Gentleman\" or \"Chesty McCluskey\", the latter name given to him by NYPD Police Chief [[William Devery|William \"Big Bill\" Devery]], and was the longtime head of the NYPD Detective's Bureau at the turn of the 20th century. He was also, at one time, the youngest inspector on the police force.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and police career===\nBorn in New York City, George McClusky joined the [[New York City Police Department]] as a patrolman in 1882. He rose more slowly in rank than many of his peers, becoming a roundsman in 1895, then sergeant and police captain within the next two years. When [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was appointed head of the [[New York City Police Commissioner|Board of Police Commissioners]], McClusky was reassigned as a patrolman. His rank would rise and fall more than any other officer in his 30 years on the police force. Indeed, he soon regained his former rank under Mayor [[William Lafayette Strong|William Strong]] and was considered one of the rising stars in the NYPD during the 1890s.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Inspector M'Clusky Is Dead Of Anaemia.

He was credited for a number of high-profile arrests during his early career as a police detective. Among these was the capture confidence man John McDermott whom he pursued through Europe until finally tracking him down at New York's popular Delmonico's on May 28, 1890. McDermott was dining with Sir [[Sir Robert Peel, 3rd Baronet|Robert Peel]] and Viscount [[Clifford Talbot]], having befriended them on his return voyage to the United States, when McClusky confronted the trickster. An altercation then occurred, the English noblemen angered at McClusky's accusations towards their friend, however McClusky was able to convince the men of McDermott's intentions and prevented them from becoming another of his victims.<ref name=obit/> A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Police Inspector [[Thomas F.

Through evidence largely collected by himself, he was able to arrest murderer [[Roland B. Molineux]]. He remained in the bureau for three years before his demotion by Police Chief [[William Devery|William \"Big Bill\" Devery]] in 1900. Devery was alleged to have been part of a gambling syndicate consisting of himself, [[Frank J. Farrell|Frank Farrell]] and [[Timothy Sullivan|Timothy \"Big Tim\" Sullivan]] which, at the time of McClusky's removal, generated around $3 million from payoffs to corrupt politicians and police officials according to the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"Lardner\"/>\n\nFollowing this, Devery was quoted as saying \"I'll put a man in charge of the Detective's Bureau that people can talk to. McClusky is too chesty to be of any use. \"Chesty\" George, that's what he is\". This was in reference both to his \"manly\" appearance as well as his familiar \"[[dandy]]\"-style of dress and the nickname would remain with him throughout his career. One summer evening, he visited the Hotel Knickerbocker wearing \"a straw hat of a colored check pattern with a six-inch brim\". A hat designed who was also in the hotel took a sketch of the hat and had his firm manufacturing them. A few days later, McClusky allegedly saw his hat in a Broadway store under a sign which read \"Step in and buy a Merry Widow. The kind wore by Inspector McClusky, the swellest cop in the world\".<ref name=obit/>\n\nTwo years later, McClusky became a police inspector and assigned to the Fifth District by Commissioner [[Francis V. Greene]]. At 42 years old, he was the youngest man in the NYPD to hold the position. Greene also returned him to the detective's bureau and soon went after the [[Morello crime family]], an early [[Sicilian Mafia|Sicilian mafiosi]] organization, whose investigation would come into conflict with [[U.S. Secret Service]] chief [[William J. Flynn|William Flynn]] then investigating the \"[[Barrel murders]]\". McClusky immediately went on the offensive ordering the arrest of a dozen known members of the Morellos. The arrests were met by fierce and violent fighting which in some cases, again according to the ''New York Times'', ended only when suspects heads were ''\"slammed into the pavement to overcome resistance\"''. Among those arrested were [[Giuseppe Morello]], [[Lupo the Wolf]], [[Vito Cascio Ferro]], and 24-year-old [[Tomasso Petto|Tomasso \"The Ox\" Petto]]. Petto, the ''Times'' claimed, had \"fought like a wild beast\" until a police officer knocked him out in \"a stunning blow\" with a [[blackjack]].<ref name=\"Reppetto\">Reppetto, Thomas A. ''American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power''. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 2004. (pg. 30-32) {{ISBN|0-8050-7798-7}}</ref>\n\nHe later marched the Morellos through the streets of [[Little Italy]], a move that has been described as an early version of the [[perp walk]] that later become a common practice of law enforcement in New York and the country as a whole. Although McClusky claimed that the three [[paddy wagon]]s which had been scheduled to transport them to the courthouse had not shown, it has been speculated that he really wanted to humiliate the Morellos by parading them \"before their countrymen as the Romans had paraded their captives\". Italian police were also known to use this tactic.<ref name=\"Reppetto\"/>\n\nThe mafiosi, however, received a sympathetic response from the large crowd which had gathered. A movement in the crowd cased detectives to believe a rescue attempt was being made to free the prisoners and police ''\"broke up the crowd ... knocking down some men and boys\"''. Flynn criticized McClusky's recklessness, noting the mobsters now had time to ''\"get their stories straight\"'', however the NYPD had brought significant attention to [[organized crime]] in New York. Vito Cascio Ferro fled from the city, living in New Orleans for a time, before returning to Sicily where he resided as a powerful figure in the Mafia for several decades.<ref name=\"Reppetto\"/>\n\nOn May 20, 1904 McCluskey came upon a vaudeville performer named [[Lew Dockstader]] who, on the streets of New York, was making a [[Kinetoscope]] film with the [[Edison Manufacturing Company|Edison Kinetscope Company]].  The short film was about president and former Police Commissioner [[Theodore Roosevelt]].  McCluskey detained Dockstader and seized the film, costumes, and \"other accessories.\"  The \"series of pictures\"  attempted to caricature you and the office you hold\" said [[William McAdoo (New Jersey)|William McAdoo]] in a letter to Roosevelt.  Dockstader agreed to turn the film over to the New York City Police Department to be forwarded to Washington, and then destroyed.  With that agreement, Dockstader was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record/ImageViewer?libID=o45413&imageNo=1|title=\"May 20, 1904 letter from William McAdoo, Police Commissioner of New York, to Theodore Roosevelt\"|website=Theodore Roosevelt Center|access-date=November 29, 2018}}</ref>  What happened to the film is unknown.

It was first believed he had become sick with [[ptomaine poisoning]] after eating [[shellfish]] at a recent shore dinner and took a leave of absence on September 18. His condition did not improve however and a physical examination found he was suffering from [[anemia|acute anemia]]. The following day, a more thorough examination by Dr. Charles E. Nammack found his blood contained only 27% of [[red corpuscles]] found in normal blood. McClusky's health grew continually worse over the next few months. Dr. Nammack later diagnosed his condition as a rare form of anemia. The doctor later explained further \"Little is known of the rare form of anemia from which the Inspector suffered. It is called progressive pernicious anaemia, and of the 1,200 cases known to the medical profession, only six recoveries are reported\". A [[blood transfusion]], he claimed, would be been ineffective as McClusky's heart and other organs were undergoing a general breakdown. In the last weeks of his life, the red corpuscles in his blood fell to 9%.<ref name=obit/>\n\nHe finally died at his West Seventeenth Street home on the night of December 17, 1912. His three sisters Mary, Margaret and Ida McClusky were with him at the time of his death. The latter two sisters were unmarried and still lived with McClusky. Mgr. Matthew A. Taylor of the Church of Blessed Sacrament was also in attendance to administer [[unction|extreme unction]]. Funeral services were held by the church at his residence the following day.<ref name=obit/>\n\nAlthough his last wishes were to have a small and quiet ceremony with no oration, the large attendance and number of floral tributes made the service more elaborate than was intended. Among those present at the funeral included Chief Inspector [[Max F. Schmittberger]], former Police Inspector [[Cornelius Hays]], former Police Chief [[John H. McCullagh]], former Congressman [[Edward J. Dunphy]] and former fire chief [[Edward Croker]]. At around 10:00 am, his body was removed from his home and carried to the hearse by seven pallbearers from Traffic Squad 3. These men were Patrolmen Brune, Matthews, Kennedy, Juna, Maloy, Shine and Young. A [[requiem mass]] was held at the Church of Blessed Sacrament before his body was buried at [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens|Calvary Cemetery]].<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/12/21/100564890.pdf Inspector McClusky Buried; Police Officials Attend Services at Church of Blessed Sacrament]\".

His three sisters Mary, Margaret and Ida McClusky were with him at the time of his death. The latter two sisters were unmarried and still lived with McClusky. Mgr. Matthew A. Taylor of the Church of Blessed Sacrament was also in attendance to administer [[unction|extreme unction]]. Funeral services were held by the church at his residence the following day.<ref name=obit/>\n\nAlthough his last wishes were to have a small and quiet ceremony with no oration, the large attendance and number of floral tributes made the service more elaborate than was intended. Among those present at the funeral included Chief Inspector [[Max F. Schmittberger]], former Police Inspector [[Cornelius Hays]], former Police Chief [[John H. McCullagh]], former Congressman [[Edward J. Dunphy]] and former fire chief [[Edward Croker]]. At around 10:00 am, his body was removed from his home and carried to the hearse by seven pallbearers from Traffic Squad 3. These men were Patrolmen Brune, Matthews, Kennedy, Juna, Maloy, Shine and Young. A [[requiem mass]] was held at the Church of Blessed Sacrament before his body was buried at [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens|Calvary Cemetery]].<ref>\"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/12/21/100564890.pdf Inspector McClusky Buried; Police Officials Attend Services at Church of Blessed Sacrament]\".

Booklist said of the novel, \u201cBarnes\u2019 spare and chilling prose flows from one horrific scene to another without, surprisingly, alienating his readers, perhaps because the heart of his narrative ultimately reveals an abiding faith in the power of human compassion.

Emily St. John Mandel said of the novel, \"Barnes's new novel is a rare and truly original work: a hard-edged fable, tender and unflinching, in which a man's descent and renewal is mirrored by his city. An eerie, beautifully written, and profoundly humane book.\"\n\nHe has also written the novel ''Something Pretty, Something Beautiful'' ([[Outpost19]] June 2013, {{ISBN|978-1937402525}}).

A book about [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Robbie Case, whose [[high tech]] company is built on a [[lie]], ''Shimmer'' follows Robbie as he attempts to unwind the lie he has created. The fictional company, Core Communications, is a provider of high end networking services to [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[computer]]s. Along with his partner and cousin, Robbie has created an elaborate system that supposedly allows mainframe computers to communicate at impossibly fast speeds. However, the system does not work. It is actually built on a technical and financial [[Ponzi scheme]] that will fail if the company ever stops expanding.\n\nReviews of ''Shimmer'' have said, \"Case\u2019s slow but accelerating downward spiral drives the narrative....

Booklist said of the novel, \u201cBarnes\u2019 spare and chilling prose flows from one horrific scene to another without, surprisingly, alienating his readers, perhaps because the heart of his narrative ultimately reveals an abiding faith in the power of human compassion.

Emily St. John Mandel said of the novel, \"Barnes's new novel is a rare and truly original work: a hard-edged fable, tender and unflinching, in which a man's descent and renewal is mirrored by his city. An eerie, beautifully written, and profoundly humane book.\"\n\nHe has also written the novel ''Something Pretty, Something Beautiful'' ([[Outpost19]] June 2013, {{ISBN|978-1937402525}}).

The fictional company, Core Communications, is a provider of high end networking services to [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[computer]]s. Along with his partner and cousin, Robbie has created an elaborate system that supposedly allows mainframe computers to communicate at impossibly fast speeds. However, the system does not work. It is actually built on a technical and financial [[Ponzi scheme]] that will fail if the company ever stops expanding.\n\nReviews of ''Shimmer'' have said, \"Case\u2019s slow but accelerating downward spiral drives the narrative....

Pioneering, influential, or otherwise significant artists include [[the Beach Boys]] (''[[Smiley Smile]]''), [[R.

At various points since the 1980s, \"lo-fi\" has been connoted with [[cassette culture]], the [[DIY culture|DIY ethos]] of punk, [[indie rock]], [[Na\u00efve art|primitivism]], [[outsider music]], [[authenticity in art|authenticity]], [[slacker]]/[[Generation X]] stereotypes, and cultural [[nostalgia]]. The notion of \"bedroom\" musicians expanded following the rise of modern [[digital audio workstations]], and in the late 2000s, lo-fi aesthetics served as the basis of the [[chillwave]] and [[hypnagogic pop]] music genres.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Definitions and etymology==\n{{Quote box\n | quote = At its most crudely sketched, lo-fi was primitivist and realist in the 1980s, postmodern in the 1990s, and archaicist in the 2000s.\n | source = \u2014Adam Harper, '' Lo-Fi Aesthetics in Popular Music Discourse'' (2014){{sfn|Harper|2014|p=5}}\n | align = right\n | width = 25em\n |}}\n\nLo-fi is the opposite of [[hi-fi]].<ref name=\"Bartlett2013\" /> Historically, the prescriptions of \"lo-fi\" have been relative to technological advances and the expectations of ordinary music listeners, causing the rhetoric and discourse surrounding the term to shift numerous times.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=4\u20137}} Usually spelled as \"low-fi\" before the 1990s, the term has existed since at least the 1950s, shortly after the acceptance of \"high fidelity\", and its definition evolved continuously between the 1970s and 2000s. In the 1976 edition of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary]]'', lo-fi was added under the definition of \"sound production less good in quality than 'hi-fi'\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=7, 11}} Music educator [[R. Murray Schafer]], in the glossary for his 1977 book ''The Tuning of the World'', defined the term as \"unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=9}}\n\nThere was virtually no appreciation for the imperfections of lo-fi music among critics until the 1980s, during which there was an emergent romanticism for [[home recording|home-recording]] and \"[[do-it-yourself]]\" (DIY) qualities.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=3\u20134, 10}} Afterward, \"DIY\" was often used interchangeably with \"lo-fi\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=44, 117}}  By the end of the 1980s, qualities such as \"home-recorded\", \"technically primitive\", and \"inexpensive equipment\" were commonly associated with the \"lo-fi\" label, and throughout the 1990s, such ideas became central to how \"lo-fi\" was popularly understood.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=11}} Consequently, in 2003, the ''Oxford Dictionary'' added a second definition for the term\u2014\"a genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound\".

More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of [[audio engineering]] as undesirable effects, such as a degraded [[audio signal]] or fluctuations in tape speed.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=15\u201316, 21, 29}} The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\" /> Recordings deemed unprofessional or \"amateurish\" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or room acoustics).{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=12}} Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as \"phonographic\" and \"non-phonographic imperfections\". He defines the former as \"elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=18}}\n\nRecording imperfections may \"fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise\", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of \"distortion\" and \"noise\" vary and sometimes overlap.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=18\u201319}} The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is [[harmonic distortion]], which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the [[dynamic range]] of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of [[rock and roll]], and since the advent of [[digital recording]], to give a recording a feeling of \"analogue warmth\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=20}} Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (\"phonographic distortion\") is typically avoided in professional contexts. \"Tape saturation\" and \"saturation distortion\" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a [[tape head]] approaches its limit of residual [[magnetic tape|magnetization]] (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with [[degaussing]] tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=20, 25}} Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.<ref name=\"Dittmar2013\">{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Tim|title=Audio Engineering 101: A Beginner's Guide to Music Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_L7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-11174-7|page=241}}</ref>\n\n\"Non-phonographic\" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (\"coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds\") or the environment (\"passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals\").{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=26\u201327}} Harper acknowledges that the \"appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are ''understood'' to be imperfections in lo-fi.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=29}} He also distinguishes between \"recording imperfections\" and \"sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or -modulation equipment ...

Pioneering, influential, or otherwise significant artists include [[the Beach Boys]] (''[[Smiley Smile]]''), [[R.

At various points since the 1980s, \"lo-fi\" has been connoted with [[cassette culture]], the [[DIY culture|DIY ethos]] of punk, [[indie rock]], [[Na\u00efve art|primitivism]], [[outsider music]], [[authenticity in art|authenticity]], [[slacker]]/[[Generation X]] stereotypes, and cultural [[nostalgia]]. The notion of \"bedroom\" musicians expanded following the rise of modern [[digital audio workstations]], and in the late 2000s, lo-fi aesthetics served as the basis of the [[chillwave]] and [[hypnagogic pop]] music genres.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Definitions and etymology==\n{{Quote box\n | quote = At its most crudely sketched, lo-fi was primitivist and realist in the 1980s, postmodern in the 1990s, and archaicist in the 2000s.\n | source = \u2014Adam Harper, '' Lo-Fi Aesthetics in Popular Music Discourse'' (2014){{sfn|Harper|2014|p=5}}\n | align = right\n | width = 25em\n |}}\n\nLo-fi is the opposite of [[hi-fi]].<ref name=\"Bartlett2013\" /> Historically, the prescriptions of \"lo-fi\" have been relative to technological advances and the expectations of ordinary music listeners, causing the rhetoric and discourse surrounding the term to shift numerous times.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=4\u20137}} Usually spelled as \"low-fi\" before the 1990s, the term has existed since at least the 1950s, shortly after the acceptance of \"high fidelity\", and its definition evolved continuously between the 1970s and 2000s. In the 1976 edition of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary]]'', lo-fi was added under the definition of \"sound production less good in quality than 'hi-fi'\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=7, 11}} Music educator [[R. Murray Schafer]], in the glossary for his 1977 book ''The Tuning of the World'', defined the term as \"unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=9}}\n\nThere was virtually no appreciation for the imperfections of lo-fi music among critics until the 1980s, during which there was an emergent romanticism for [[home recording|home-recording]] and \"[[do-it-yourself]]\" (DIY) qualities.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=3\u20134, 10}} Afterward, \"DIY\" was often used interchangeably with \"lo-fi\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=44, 117}}  By the end of the 1980s, qualities such as \"home-recorded\", \"technically primitive\", and \"inexpensive equipment\" were commonly associated with the \"lo-fi\" label, and throughout the 1990s, such ideas became central to how \"lo-fi\" was popularly understood.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=11}} Consequently, in 2003, the ''Oxford Dictionary'' added a second definition for the term\u2014\"a genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound\".

More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of [[audio engineering]] as undesirable effects, such as a degraded [[audio signal]] or fluctuations in tape speed.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=15\u201316, 21, 29}} The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\" /> Recordings deemed unprofessional or \"amateurish\" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or room acoustics).{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=12}} Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as \"phonographic\" and \"non-phonographic imperfections\". He defines the former as \"elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=18}}\n\nRecording imperfections may \"fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise\", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of \"distortion\" and \"noise\" vary and sometimes overlap.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=18\u201319}} The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is [[harmonic distortion]], which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the [[dynamic range]] of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of [[rock and roll]], and since the advent of [[digital recording]], to give a recording a feeling of \"analogue warmth\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=20}} Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (\"phonographic distortion\") is typically avoided in professional contexts. \"Tape saturation\" and \"saturation distortion\" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a [[tape head]] approaches its limit of residual [[magnetic tape|magnetization]] (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with [[degaussing]] tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=20, 25}} Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.<ref name=\"Dittmar2013\">{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Tim|title=Audio Engineering 101: A Beginner's Guide to Music Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_L7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-11174-7|page=241}}</ref>\n\n\"Non-phonographic\" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (\"coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds\") or the environment (\"passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals\").{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=26\u201327}} Harper acknowledges that the \"appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are ''understood'' to be imperfections in lo-fi.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=29}} He also distinguishes between \"recording imperfections\" and \"sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or -modulation equipment ...  Hypothetically, at least, lo-fi effects are created during recording and production itself, and perceptibly remain in master recordings that are then identically copied for release.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=16}}\n\nBruce Bartlett, in his 2013 guide ''Practical Recording Techniques'', states that \"lo-fi sounds might have a narrow frequency response (a thin, cheap sound), and might include noise such as hiss or record scratches.

They were rarely known as a \"lo-fi\" group during their active years, and were only noted for their pioneering role in the movement after the term's definition evolved in the mid 1990s.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=246}} Elsewhere, WFMU DJ [[Irwin Chusid]] was responsible for inventing and popularizing the \"[[outsider music]]\" category\u2014much of it overlapping with lo-fi\u2014which he championed in the 1980s.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=48}} Adam Harper credits [[Daniel Johnston]] and Jandek with \"form[ing] a bridge between 1980s [[naive art|primitivism]] and the lo-fi indie rock of the 1990s. ... both musicians introduced the notion that lo-fi was not just acceptable but the special context of some extraordinary and brilliant musicians.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=180}}\n\n===1990s: Changed definitions of \"lo-fi\" and \"indie\"===\n====Relation to \"alternative\" music====\n\n[[File:Robert Pollard sxsw 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Pollard]] of [[Guided by Voices]] (pictured in 2006)]]\n\nDuring the 1990s, the media's usage of the word \"indie\" evolved from music \"produced away from the music industry's largest record labels\" to a particular style of rock or pop music viewed in the US as the \"alternative to '[[alternative rock|alternative]]'\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=36\u201339}} Following the success of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991), alternative rock became a cultural talking point, and subsequently, the concept of a lo-fi movement coalesced between 1992 and 1994. Centered on artists such as [[Guided by Voices]], [[Sebadoh]], [[Beck]], and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], most of the writing about alternative and lo-fi aligned it with [[Generation X]] and \"[[slacker]]\" stereotypes that originated from [[Douglas Coupland]]'s novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture|Generation X]]'' and [[Richard Linklater]]'s film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' (both released 1991).{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=273\u2013274, 294}} Some of the delineation between [[grunge music|grunge]] and lo-fi came with respect to the music's \"[[authenticity in art|authenticity]]\". Even though Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] was well known for being fond of Johnston, K Records, and [[the Shaggs]], there was a faction of indie rock that viewed grunge as a [[sell-out]] genre, believing that the imperfections of lo-fi was what gave the music its authenticity.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=307}}\n\nIn April 1993, the term \"lo-fi\" gained mainstream currency after it was featured as a headline in the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\"/> The most widely-read article was published by the same paper in August 1994 with the headline \"Lo-Fi Rockers Opt for Raw Over Slick\". In contrast to a similar story ran in the paper seven years earlier, which never deployed \"lo-fi\" in the context of an unprofessional recording, writer Matt Deihl conflated \"lo-fi\" with \"DIY\" and \"a rough sound quality\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=44}} He wrote:\n\n{{quote|Alternately called lo-fi, referring to the rough sound quality resulting from such an approach, or D.I.Y., an acronym for \"do it yourself,\" this tradition is distinguished by an aversion to state-of-the-art recording techniques. ...

He said that although the band was being \"championed as the pioneers of the lo-fi movement,\" he was not familiar with the term, and explained that \"[a] lot of people were picking up [Tascam] machines at the time ...

The venture was inspired by the success of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[East India Company|British East India Company]]. This made Gothenburg a European center of trade in eastern products . The main goods were silk, tea, furniture, porcelain, precious stones and other distinctive luxury items. Trade with China saw the arrival of some new customs in Sweden. The Chinese cultural influence increased, and tea, rice, [[arrack]] and new root vegetables started appearing in Swedish homes.<ref name=spotting>{{cite web |title=East India Company House |url=https://www.spottinghistory.com/view/860/east-india-company-house/ |website=Spotting history |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt grew to become the largest trading company in Sweden during the 18th century, a total of 132 expeditions were carried out with 37 different ships.

The royal privileges for the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) were granted almost a century after the other European trading companies were established.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=28}}\n\nWith the advent of the East India trade in the 17th century, Chinese and Indian goods were imported to Sweden. Drinking tea and having Chinese objects became the height of fashion among Swedish socialites and the middle class. Chinese culture, philosophy, art, agriculture, and architecture were also studied and copied. The most prominent example of this is the [[Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm]], which was followed by smaller parks like the one built by [[Jean Abraham Grill]] at [[Grill (family)#Godeg\u00e5rd|Godeg\u00e5rd]]. China was considered a model community, a template for how a country should be governed. This culminated during the 18th century, when many Swedish scientists and politicians even suggested that Sweden should be governed by intellectual bureaucrats, \"[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]\", led by a sovereign king in a Chinese manner.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|pp=22\u201325}}\n\n=== Early attempts ===\n\nThe first attempt of organizing a Swedish East India trading company was made by a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] merchant, [[Willem Usselincx]].{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=10}} During the 17th century, the Dutch merchants dominated the [[History of Gothenburg|newly founded]] [[Gothenburg]] on the west coast of Sweden. The town was considered ideal for Sweden's international trade since most of the goods were transported on ships and this was the only major Swedish port accessible without having to pass the [[Denmark|Danish]] customs at [[\u00d8resund]].{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=29}} On 14{{nbsp}}June 1626, Usselincx received royal privileges for a trading company for twelve years, from the Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]]. The privileges included clauses about the ethics of trading with foreign, indigenous people. The first priority was to establish friendly, long-term relations that would be mutually beneficiary for both parties. The venture was supported by a number of prominent Swedes, including the King himself, but raising the necessary money proved harder. Political difficulties and Sweden's participation in the [[Thirty Years' War]], where King Gustav II was killed, put an end to the plans. The resources were instead used for a smaller company, trading within Europe.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe next attempt to start a trading company was made in 1661, by German merchant Erlenkamp, who suggested a route over the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Northern Sea Route]], past [[Japan]] and further on to [[China]] and [[India]]. The aim was to bypass the Spanish and Portuguese blockades.  The plan did not gain any support as the ice barriers proved even more difficult.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=11}} At the end of the 1660s, a petition from diplomat and London resident Johan Leijonbergh was sent to the Swedish King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] regarding one Olle Borg who had worked in the [[Dutch East India Company]] for eighteen years. Borg stated that if there was a war between Sweden and Denmark, he could deliver the Danish fort in [[Tharangambadi]], India, to the Swedes. Knut Kurck, Peter Schnack and Johan Olivecreutz were appointed directors for the company, but the political unrest in Sweden at that time plus trouble with actually getting the money that had been promised from the investors thwarted this venture as well, and in 1674, the charter was dissolved. Residual resources were used to send two ships, the ''Solen'' (the Sun) and the ''Trumslagaren'' (the Drummer), to [[Lisbon]] for salt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=35\u201337}}\n\nA later attempt to establish the Swedish trade on the East Indies was made by pirates sailing out from [[Madagascar]]. After having attacked other trading ships, they had become wealthy and were looking for a place to settle down and invest their money in legitimate enterprise. The pirates numbered about 1,500 and commanded a considerable and well-armed fleet of ships. They started by offering the Swedish King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] half a million pounds sterling and 25 armed ships for his protection, but the matter was not resolved. In 1718, representatives for the pirates met again with the King at his camp during the [[Siege of Fredriksten|campaign against Norway]]. The new offer was for 60 ships, armed and stocked with goods, if the pirates were allowed to settle down in Gothenburg and start a trade with the East Indies under the Swedish flag.

Opinions about whether trade with the East Indies would be profitable enough diverged.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=12}} The greatest concern was that Sweden would not have enough resources to defend the company's ships and [[trading post]]s. The trading companies from [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] did not hesitate to attack other ships to prevent competition. A failed attempt to start a competing trade company in [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], the [[Ostend Company]], was discouraging.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nWhat finally made the Swedish venture possible was the strong support from foreign traders and merchants, foremost British but also Dutch, who had been shut out from the companies in their respective countries. The majority of the investors, as well as the buyers of the goods imported by the company, were foreigners.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nGranting permission for a charter was not entirely uncontroversial during that time when [[mercantilism]], which advocated regulations so that the production of export goods was promoted and import reduced, was the dominant idea for trade. Opposition became even more apparent after the first journey made by the ship ''Friedericus Rex Sueciaes'' in 1735.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=46}} Demands were made in the [[Riksdag]] for sanctions and restrictions for the trade company, a number of [[pamphlet]]s were written, arguing that Swedish steel and timber were wastefully being exchanged for such  \"worthless goods\" as tea and [[Canton porcelain|porcelain]].{{efn|Contemporary arguments pro and con concerning the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) are examined in the last chapter of Christian Koninckx.{{sfn|Koninckx|1980}}}} One of the most ardent critics against the charter was Johan Arckenholtz.

In addition to Colin Campbell, Niclas Sahlgren and Teodor Ankarcrona, the directors were former secretary of the Executive Board Magnus Lagerstr\u00f6m, the Stockholm merchants Anders Plomgren and [[Grill family#Abraham Grill (II) the Younger|Abraham Grill]]. These six members of the board later elected [[Claes Grill]], Jacob von Utfall Jeanson, S. N. Wenngren and Nils Str\u00f6m as directors.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=73}}\n\nThe second charter was for 20 years and the directors followed the ways of the first octroi. They collected the means from the investors to fund each of the first 14 ships separately. In 1753, the company was reorganized into a joint-stock company by creating a fixed fund where anyone could subscribe for shares, but not for less than 500 riksdaler in silver.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nEven after the company went public, it still retained its secrecy regarding the business. The management deliberately withheld information from the shareholders or lied about how profitable parts of the business were. The directors said that the profit from the trade with China was declining and that the company should be granted permission to send a ship to India, contrary to the regulations for the trade so far. An exemption was granted in 1749, and a ship was sent to Surat in India. On its return in 1752, that ship yielded a profit of 103% and two more ships were sent to Surat. The English and the Dutch controlled most of the trade in the town and did everything to prevent the Swedes from doing business there and several incidents occurred. The company decided to refocus in the China trade instead. That trade yielded an average profit of 30\u201340% during the second charter.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=314\u2013316}}\n\n=== The third octroi (1766\u20131786) ===\n\n[[File:Hongs at Canton.jpg|thumb|right|Canton [[Thirteen Factories]], with flags of Denmark, Spain, the U.S., Sweden, Britain, and the Netherlands, c. 1820]]\nWhen it was time to renew the charter in 1766, the first directors were Robert Finlay of Irish and Scottish origin,  Swedish Fabian L\u00f6wen and Georg Herman Conradi of German descent, all residing in Stockholm. With this the power within the management shifted from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where two new ships also were bought.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=131\u2013133}} The Swedish government extorted a loan at 6% interest to the SOIC to be paid during 1766\u201369, estimated in 1813 to have been the equivalent of \u00a3100,000, and another, interest-free, for half of that sum, to be repaid out of import duties,{{sfn|Milburn|1813|p=577}} in essence an advance payment of duty.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=317}}\n\nDuring the third charter, 39 voyages were made to Canton and none of the ships was lost or damaged, but the profit from the trade with China was declining. The turning point for Sweden came in 1780, with the [[American Revolutionary War]] when France, the [[Dutch Republic]] and Spain joined forces against Britain and thereafter were blocked from trading with China. The price of tea fell in Canton due to the lack of demand, but went up in Europe where Sweden was now practically the only supplier of tea. This was reflected in the total sum of the profit for the third octroi, which was 58% higher than the previous two.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nThe goods that were exported from Sweden also changed during that period. The former main products such as iron, wood and tar are missing from the freight lists. Instead the biggest item was silver, followed by English lead and Swedish woollen cloth or [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=137}} During the later part of the third charter, it became common practice for one of the supercargoes to stay on permanently in Canton for years. One of those was Jean Abraham Grill, who made ample use of his time there for his own private affairs, a practice that was continued by other resident supercargoes.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=104\u2013105}} [[Carl Linnaeus]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] also made use of the company's ships. They sent out [[Apostles of Linnaeus|scientists and researchers]] to gather information about animals and plants from all the places that the ships visited and to keep detailed journals. The company would not allow idle passengers on board, so most of the scientists were given \"crash courses\" in theology and were hastily ordained to serve as ship's chaplains. These arrangements started during the second charter and peaked during the third.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=137\u2013105<!--check page number-->}}\n\nIn 1758, the Swedes were finally able to let their ships anchor and replenish provisions at the Cape (now known as [[Cape Town]]), a port controlled by the Dutch, due to political changes in Europe. But with the end of the American war in 1783, Sweden lost its advantage in the tea trade and the decline of the company resumed. The SOIC's supercargo in Canton in 1777, [[Finns|Finnish]] Peter Johan Bladh, reflected on this and suggested that an emissary should be sent to the emperor of China with a proposition that the European trade with China should be conducted through one single European company, administrated by Sweden. He stated that unless the British were stopped in time they would infiltrate China the same way they had done in India by \"securing an unbearable domination\" there. The request was never sent since the directors wanted to continue the trade in the same way as before.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=147\u2013150}}\n\nThe mercantile expansion of the SOIC during the third octroi provided a setting for [[Wallenberg family|Jacob Wallenberg]]'s comic ''Min son p\u00e5 galejan'' (\"My Son on{{sic}} the Galley\")<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wallenberg|first1=Jacob|last2=Graves|first2=Peter|title=My son on the galley, translation of the 1769 original: Min son p\u00e5 galejan|date=1994|series=Norvik press series.

The management was the same, a fixed fund existed and some of the fees, taxes and regulations were altered. During this octroi, the company owned 12 ships that were sent out on a total of 31 journeys. Three of the ships were lost and one was damaged and sold. The shareholders received no dividend during the fourth octroi.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=151}}\n\nThe profit from the trade continued to decline, much because of the [[Pitt's India Act|new rules and regulations]] regarding the import of tea to England. Most of the SOIC's earlier tea cargoes had been smuggled to England, but the profit no longer made up for the risk of such an undertaking.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=153}} Talk of shutting down the company started in 1789, and after 1804, no more ships were sent out from Sweden. On 27{{nbsp}}June 1808, the company informed the shareholders of the situation and on 18{{nbsp}}May 1811, the company of the fourth charter was declared bankrupt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=318}}\n\n=== Decline and fall ===\n\nThere was a fifth octroi, starting in 1806 with privileges granted for 15 years, but those were quite different from the previous. Now anyone had the right to trade with the countries on the other side of Cape if the SOIC had not started the trade by launching a ship within two years. With the investors' faith in the trade now broken, no ships were sent out and at a shareholders meeting on 13{{nbsp}}December 1813, the company folded, eight years before the octroi ended. The remaining stock and inventory was sold to foreign buyers and in 1814, the trade was declared free for anyone.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\n== Cargo ==\n[[File:Kinesiskt siden med m\u00e5lat m\u00f6nster, 1700-talet..jpg|thumb|Painted, Chinese silk fabric brought to Sweden by the SOIC, 18th century]]\nThe main valuable cargo from China was tea. In an overview from 1774, its share was about 90%. Much of the tea was re-exported and smuggled into England, undercutting the prices of that country's own trade monopoly held by the [[East India Company]]. Porcelain was also important, accounting for about 5% of the cargo's value. Over the years it is estimated that some 50 million pieces of porcelain were imported by the SOIC. The spirit [[arrack]], a new commodity for Sweden, was also considered valuable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punsch, A Gift from God (translated) |url=https://naringslivshistoria.se/bizstories-nyheter/naringslivshistoria/punsch-du-gudalika-gava-2/ |website=naringslivshistoria.se |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nA cargo tally, printed by William Milburn in 1813, shows the following.\n{{columns\n| colwidth = 30em\n|col1 =\n'''Chests of tea:'''\n* [[Bohea]], {{convert|1,030,642|lb|kg}} in 2885&nbsp;chests\n* [[Congou]] ({{convert|90,589|lb|kg}})\n* [[Lapsang souchong|Souchong]] ({{convert|67,388|lb|kg}})\n* [[Tea leaf grading|Pekoe]] ({{convert|17,205|lb|kg}})\n* [[Hyson]] and \"Hyson Skin\"{{efn|Definition of Hyson skin varies: \"The light and inferior leaves separated from hyson by a winnowing machine.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hyson skin |editor=Gove Philip Babcock |encyclopedia=Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged |year=1993 |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/11616498 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |location=Cologne |isbn=3-8290-5292-8 }}</ref>\n ...a superior kind of green tea, of a round, knobby, brightish leaf; but great part of what is imported, is of inferior quality, of a yellowish open leaf, somewhat resembling singlo, and, in consequence, varies greatly in price.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=Robinson Crusoe|url=https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog|year=1815|publisher=Joseph Mawman|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog/page/n426 400]}}</ref>}} (together {{convert|5,713|lb|kg}})\n'''Textiles:'''\n* [[Damask]]s and heavier damasks for furniture\n* [[Satin]] [[silk]], some of it \"coloured and flowered\"\n* [[Paduasoy]]\n* [[Glossary of textile manufacturing#G|Grogram]] also known as ''gorgoron''\n* [[Taffeta]]s,\n* [[Lampas]]\n* [[Nankeen|Nankeen cloth]]\n* 33&nbsp;chests of raw silk\n| col2 =\n'''Drugs:'''\n* [[Galangal|Galangal root]]\n* [[Wolfiporia extensa|China root]]\n* [[Sago]]\n* [[Rhubarb]]\n'''Miscellaneous:'''\n* Mother-of-pearl, some of it cut in thin [[jeton]]s\n* Thin canes for hoops\n* Painted wallpapers\n* Lacquered ([[Japanning|japanned]]) [[Quadrille (card game)|quadrille boxes]]\n* [[Lowboy|Dressing tables]]\n* Tablets for table tops\n* Arrack (used in Swedish [[punsch]]),<ref name=\"spotting\" /> {{convert|6|MT|lb}}\n* Porcelain, in 274&nbsp;chests and 989&nbsp;barrels and other packages\n}}\n\n== Ships ==\n\nThe ships used by the Swedish East India Company.<ref name=NordiskaMuseet>{{cite web|title=Expeditionerna: Kompaniets skepp|trans-title=The Expeditions: The Company's Ships|url=http://ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se/system/exp/exp_skepp.html|website=ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se|publisher=[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=18 July 2014 |language=Swedish}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=177\u2013184}}\n[[File:Tillaeus karta 1733.jpg|thumb|Map of Stockholm in 1733, by Petrus Tillaeus]]\n[[File:Terra Nova 1733a.jpg|thumb|Close-up of Tillaeus' map showing the Terra Nova wharf, 1733]]\n[[File:Soedermalm 1674.jpg|thumb|Southeast Stockholm in 1674, with the Stora Stads wharf bay in the upper righthand corner.

This design was also used on East India Company ships.]]\nAccording to the first charter, the SOIC's ships were only allowed to use the Swedish merchant flag, a rectangular blue flag with a yellow cross. With the renewal of the charter in 1746, the company was allowed to add its name cypher, or [[monogram]], to the flag in order to distinguish the ships from other trading vessels. Soon after that, the ships of the SOIC started to use a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, used the Swedish [[ensign]] a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead. The swallowtails were even used in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of the ships' [[sloop]]s when they carried a director of the company. This was a double felony, since flags should only be used at the [[stern]] of the sloop.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nThe prohibition did not bother the executives in the SOIC, and the oldest preserved flag in Sweden is a swallowtail from the ship ''Lovisa Ulrica'' (to Canton 1767\u201368). A similar flag, ordered by SOIC director [[Grill (family)#Claes Grill (I)|Claes Grill]], is kept at [[Svindersvik]].<ref>{{cite book |last=S\u00f6derberg|first=Bengt G.|date=1968|title=Slott och herres\u00e4ten i Sverige.

Some of these signals were just for the individual ships and some were used internationally. Sometimes this even included showing flags of other nationalities. Those flags were also used as deception if the ship was where hostile ships could be encountered and the captain wanted to avoid confrontation. There are records of ships from the SOIC approaching land under French or English flag, to collect or buy food in places where Swedish ships were forbidden to anchor.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=176}}\n\n== The modern Swedish East India Company ==\n\n[[File:Modern SOIC headquarter.jpg|thumb|The modern SOIC headquarter at Pier Four in the [[Port of Gothenburg]] with the ''[[G\u00f6theborg (ship)|G\u00f6theborg]]'' prepared for winter]]\nOn 28{{nbsp}}December 1993, a new company called the ''Svenska Ostindiska Companiet Aktiebolag'' (the Swedish East India Company Limited) was registered.

The venture was inspired by the success of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[East India Company|British East India Company]]. This made Gothenburg a European center of trade in eastern products . The main goods were silk, tea, furniture, porcelain, precious stones and other distinctive luxury items. Trade with China saw the arrival of some new customs in Sweden. The Chinese cultural influence increased, and tea, rice, [[arrack]] and new root vegetables started appearing in Swedish homes.<ref name=spotting>{{cite web |title=East India Company House |url=https://www.spottinghistory.com/view/860/east-india-company-house/ |website=Spotting history |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt grew to become the largest trading company in Sweden during the 18th century, a total of 132 expeditions were carried out with 37 different ships.

The royal privileges for the Swedish East India Company (SOIC) were granted almost a century after the other European trading companies were established.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=28}}\n\nWith the advent of the East India trade in the 17th century, Chinese and Indian goods were imported to Sweden. Drinking tea and having Chinese objects became the height of fashion among Swedish socialites and the middle class. Chinese culture, philosophy, art, agriculture, and architecture were also studied and copied. The most prominent example of this is the [[Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm]], which was followed by smaller parks like the one built by [[Jean Abraham Grill]] at [[Grill (family)#Godeg\u00e5rd|Godeg\u00e5rd]]. China was considered a model community, a template for how a country should be governed. This culminated during the 18th century, when many Swedish scientists and politicians even suggested that Sweden should be governed by intellectual bureaucrats, \"[[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]]\", led by a sovereign king in a Chinese manner.{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|pp=22\u201325}}\n\n=== Early attempts ===\n\nThe first attempt of organizing a Swedish East India trading company was made by a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] merchant, [[Willem Usselincx]].{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=10}} During the 17th century, the Dutch merchants dominated the [[History of Gothenburg|newly founded]] [[Gothenburg]] on the west coast of Sweden. The town was considered ideal for Sweden's international trade since most of the goods were transported on ships and this was the only major Swedish port accessible without having to pass the [[Denmark|Danish]] customs at [[\u00d8resund]].{{sfn|Lindqvist|2002|p=29}} On 14{{nbsp}}June 1626, Usselincx received royal privileges for a trading company for twelve years, from the Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]]. The privileges included clauses about the ethics of trading with foreign, indigenous people. The first priority was to establish friendly, long-term relations that would be mutually beneficiary for both parties. The venture was supported by a number of prominent Swedes, including the King himself, but raising the necessary money proved harder. Political difficulties and Sweden's participation in the [[Thirty Years' War]], where King Gustav II was killed, put an end to the plans. The resources were instead used for a smaller company, trading within Europe.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe next attempt to start a trading company was made in 1661, by German merchant Erlenkamp, who suggested a route over the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Northern Sea Route]], past [[Japan]] and further on to [[China]] and [[India]]. The aim was to bypass the Spanish and Portuguese blockades.  The plan did not gain any support as the ice barriers proved even more difficult.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=11}} At the end of the 1660s, a petition from diplomat and London resident Johan Leijonbergh was sent to the Swedish King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] regarding one Olle Borg who had worked in the [[Dutch East India Company]] for eighteen years. Borg stated that if there was a war between Sweden and Denmark, he could deliver the Danish fort in [[Tharangambadi]], India, to the Swedes. Knut Kurck, Peter Schnack and Johan Olivecreutz were appointed directors for the company, but the political unrest in Sweden at that time plus trouble with actually getting the money that had been promised from the investors thwarted this venture as well, and in 1674, the charter was dissolved. Residual resources were used to send two ships, the ''Solen'' (the Sun) and the ''Trumslagaren'' (the Drummer), to [[Lisbon]] for salt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=35\u201337}}\n\nA later attempt to establish the Swedish trade on the East Indies was made by pirates sailing out from [[Madagascar]]. After having attacked other trading ships, they had become wealthy and were looking for a place to settle down and invest their money in legitimate enterprise. The pirates numbered about 1,500 and commanded a considerable and well-armed fleet of ships. They started by offering the Swedish King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] half a million pounds sterling and 25 armed ships for his protection, but the matter was not resolved. In 1718, representatives for the pirates met again with the King at his camp during the [[Siege of Fredriksten|campaign against Norway]]. The new offer was for 60 ships, armed and stocked with goods, if the pirates were allowed to settle down in Gothenburg and start a trade with the East Indies under the Swedish flag. One privateer by the name of Morgan actually obtained a charter for an East India Company and a letter of appointment for himself as governor over the colonies that could be the result of such an enterprise. When the King was shot and died on 30{{nbsp}}November 1718, the venture folded.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=37}}\n\n=== Sweden after the Great Northern War ===\n\n[[File:Sockersk\u00e5l GM 7012.jpg|thumb|upright|Porcelain sugar bowl made in China c. 1770\u201390, imported by the SOIC, City Museum of Gothenburg]]\nSweden was impoverished after the [[Great Northern War]], and trade was seen as an option for rebuilding the country. Opinions about whether trade with the East Indies would be profitable enough diverged.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|p=12}} The greatest concern was that Sweden would not have enough resources to defend the company's ships and [[trading post]]s. The trading companies from [[England]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]] did not hesitate to attack other ships to prevent competition.

An exemption was granted in 1749, and a ship was sent to Surat in India. On its return in 1752, that ship yielded a profit of 103% and two more ships were sent to Surat. The English and the Dutch controlled most of the trade in the town and did everything to prevent the Swedes from doing business there and several incidents occurred. The company decided to refocus in the China trade instead. That trade yielded an average profit of 30\u201340% during the second charter.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=314\u2013316}}\n\n=== The third octroi (1766\u20131786) ===\n\n[[File:Hongs at Canton.jpg|thumb|right|Canton [[Thirteen Factories]], with flags of Denmark, Spain, the U.S., Sweden, Britain, and the Netherlands, c. 1820]]\nWhen it was time to renew the charter in 1766, the first directors were Robert Finlay of Irish and Scottish origin,  Swedish Fabian L\u00f6wen and Georg Herman Conradi of German descent, all residing in Stockholm. With this the power within the management shifted from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where two new ships also were bought.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=131\u2013133}} The Swedish government extorted a loan at 6% interest to the SOIC to be paid during 1766\u201369, estimated in 1813 to have been the equivalent of \u00a3100,000, and another, interest-free, for half of that sum, to be repaid out of import duties,{{sfn|Milburn|1813|p=577}} in essence an advance payment of duty.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=317}}\n\nDuring the third charter, 39 voyages were made to Canton and none of the ships was lost or damaged, but the profit from the trade with China was declining. The turning point for Sweden came in 1780, with the [[American Revolutionary War]] when France, the [[Dutch Republic]] and Spain joined forces against Britain and thereafter were blocked from trading with China. The price of tea fell in Canton due to the lack of demand, but went up in Europe where Sweden was now practically the only supplier of tea. This was reflected in the total sum of the profit for the third octroi, which was 58% higher than the previous two.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nThe goods that were exported from Sweden also changed during that period. The former main products such as iron, wood and tar are missing from the freight lists. Instead the biggest item was silver, followed by English lead and Swedish woollen cloth or [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=137}} During the later part of the third charter, it became common practice for one of the supercargoes to stay on permanently in Canton for years. One of those was Jean Abraham Grill, who made ample use of his time there for his own private affairs, a practice that was continued by other resident supercargoes.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=104\u2013105}} [[Carl Linnaeus]] and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] also made use of the company's ships. They sent out [[Apostles of Linnaeus|scientists and researchers]] to gather information about animals and plants from all the places that the ships visited and to keep detailed journals. The company would not allow idle passengers on board, so most of the scientists were given \"crash courses\" in theology and were hastily ordained to serve as ship's chaplains. These arrangements started during the second charter and peaked during the third.{{sfn|Fr\u00e4ngsmyr|1990|pp=137\u2013105<!--check page number-->}}\n\nIn 1758, the Swedes were finally able to let their ships anchor and replenish provisions at the Cape (now known as [[Cape Town]]), a port controlled by the Dutch, due to political changes in Europe. But with the end of the American war in 1783, Sweden lost its advantage in the tea trade and the decline of the company resumed. The SOIC's supercargo in Canton in 1777, [[Finns|Finnish]] Peter Johan Bladh, reflected on this and suggested that an emissary should be sent to the emperor of China with a proposition that the European trade with China should be conducted through one single European company, administrated by Sweden. He stated that unless the British were stopped in time they would infiltrate China the same way they had done in India by \"securing an unbearable domination\" there. The request was never sent since the directors wanted to continue the trade in the same way as before.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=147\u2013150}}\n\nThe mercantile expansion of the SOIC during the third octroi provided a setting for [[Wallenberg family|Jacob Wallenberg]]'s comic ''Min son p\u00e5 galejan'' (\"My Son on{{sic}} the Galley\")<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wallenberg|first1=Jacob|last2=Graves|first2=Peter|title=My son on the galley, translation of the 1769 original: Min son p\u00e5 galejan|date=1994|series=Norvik press series.

The management was the same, a fixed fund existed and some of the fees, taxes and regulations were altered. During this octroi, the company owned 12 ships that were sent out on a total of 31 journeys. Three of the ships were lost and one was damaged and sold. The shareholders received no dividend during the fourth octroi.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=151}}\n\nThe profit from the trade continued to decline, much because of the [[Pitt's India Act|new rules and regulations]] regarding the import of tea to England. Most of the SOIC's earlier tea cargoes had been smuggled to England, but the profit no longer made up for the risk of such an undertaking.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=153}} Talk of shutting down the company started in 1789, and after 1804, no more ships were sent out from Sweden. On 27{{nbsp}}June 1808, the company informed the shareholders of the situation and on 18{{nbsp}}May 1811, the company of the fourth charter was declared bankrupt.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=318}}\n\n=== Decline and fall ===\n\nThere was a fifth octroi, starting in 1806 with privileges granted for 15 years, but those were quite different from the previous. Now anyone had the right to trade with the countries on the other side of Cape if the SOIC had not started the trade by launching a ship within two years. With the investors' faith in the trade now broken, no ships were sent out and at a shareholders meeting on 13{{nbsp}}December 1813, the company folded, eight years before the octroi ended. The remaining stock and inventory was sold to foreign buyers and in 1814, the trade was declared free for anyone.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\n== Cargo ==\n[[File:Kinesiskt siden med m\u00e5lat m\u00f6nster, 1700-talet..jpg|thumb|Painted, Chinese silk fabric brought to Sweden by the SOIC, 18th century]]\nThe main valuable cargo from China was tea. In an overview from 1774, its share was about 90%. Much of the tea was re-exported and smuggled into England, undercutting the prices of that country's own trade monopoly held by the [[East India Company]]. Porcelain was also important, accounting for about 5% of the cargo's value. Over the years it is estimated that some 50 million pieces of porcelain were imported by the SOIC. The spirit [[arrack]], a new commodity for Sweden, was also considered valuable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punsch, A Gift from God (translated) |url=https://naringslivshistoria.se/bizstories-nyheter/naringslivshistoria/punsch-du-gudalika-gava-2/ |website=naringslivshistoria.se |accessdate=26 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nA cargo tally, printed by William Milburn in 1813, shows the following.\n{{columns\n| colwidth = 30em\n|col1 =\n'''Chests of tea:'''\n* [[Bohea]], {{convert|1,030,642|lb|kg}} in 2885&nbsp;chests\n* [[Congou]] ({{convert|90,589|lb|kg}})\n* [[Lapsang souchong|Souchong]] ({{convert|67,388|lb|kg}})\n* [[Tea leaf grading|Pekoe]] ({{convert|17,205|lb|kg}})\n* [[Hyson]] and \"Hyson Skin\"{{efn|Definition of Hyson skin varies: \"The light and inferior leaves separated from hyson by a winnowing machine.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hyson skin |editor=Gove Philip Babcock |encyclopedia=Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged |year=1993 |url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/11616498 |publisher=K\u00f6nemann |location=Cologne |isbn=3-8290-5292-8 }}</ref>\n ...a superior kind of green tea, of a round, knobby, brightish leaf; but great part of what is imported, is of inferior quality, of a yellowish open leaf, somewhat resembling singlo, and, in consequence, varies greatly in price.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=Robinson Crusoe|url=https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog|year=1815|publisher=Joseph Mawman|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/crusoewrittenby01defogoog/page/n426 400]}}</ref>}} (together {{convert|5,713|lb|kg}})\n'''Textiles:'''\n* [[Damask]]s and heavier damasks for furniture\n* [[Satin]] [[silk]], some of it \"coloured and flowered\"\n* [[Paduasoy]]\n* [[Glossary of textile manufacturing#G|Grogram]] also known as ''gorgoron''\n* [[Taffeta]]s,\n* [[Lampas]]\n* [[Nankeen|Nankeen cloth]]\n* 33&nbsp;chests of raw silk\n| col2 =\n'''Drugs:'''\n* [[Galangal|Galangal root]]\n* [[Wolfiporia extensa|China root]]\n* [[Sago]]\n* [[Rhubarb]]\n'''Miscellaneous:'''\n* Mother-of-pearl, some of it cut in thin [[jeton]]s\n* Thin canes for hoops\n* Painted wallpapers\n* Lacquered ([[Japanning|japanned]]) [[Quadrille (card game)|quadrille boxes]]\n* [[Lowboy|Dressing tables]]\n* Tablets for table tops\n* Arrack (used in Swedish [[punsch]]),<ref name=\"spotting\" /> {{convert|6|MT|lb}}\n* Porcelain, in 274&nbsp;chests and 989&nbsp;barrels and other packages\n}}\n\n== Ships ==\n\nThe ships used by the Swedish East India Company.<ref name=NordiskaMuseet>{{cite web|title=Expeditionerna: Kompaniets skepp|trans-title=The Expeditions: The Company's Ships|url=http://ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se/system/exp/exp_skepp.html|website=ostindiska.nordiskamuseet.se|publisher=[[Nordic Museum]]|accessdate=18 July 2014 |language=Swedish}}</ref>{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=177\u2013184}}\n[[File:Tillaeus karta 1733.jpg|thumb|Map of Stockholm in 1733, by Petrus Tillaeus]]\n[[File:Terra Nova 1733a.jpg|thumb|Close-up of Tillaeus' map showing the Terra Nova wharf, 1733]]\n[[File:Soedermalm 1674.jpg|thumb|Southeast Stockholm in 1674, with the Stora Stads wharf bay in the upper righthand corner.

This design was also used on East India Company ships.]]\nAccording to the first charter, the SOIC's ships were only allowed to use the Swedish merchant flag, a rectangular blue flag with a yellow cross. With the renewal of the charter in 1746, the company was allowed to add its name cypher, or [[monogram]], to the flag in order to distinguish the ships from other trading vessels. Soon after that, the ships of the SOIC started to use a fork-tailed or swallow-tailed flag. The intention was that the ship should resemble a warship and thereby not attract pirates. Swedish warships, or ships carrying a military commander, used the Swedish [[ensign]] a triple-tailed or swallowtail and tongue version of the rectangular flag. This was against the rules and regulations for flags at that time. The use of the swallowtail was prohibited in a royal decree in 1751, but the SOIC ignored this and ordered their flags in Canton instead. The swallowtails were even used in the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of the ships' [[sloop]]s when they carried a director of the company. This was a double felony, since flags should only be used at the [[stern]] of the sloop.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nThe prohibition did not bother the executives in the SOIC, and the oldest preserved flag in Sweden is a swallowtail from the ship ''Lovisa Ulrica'' (to Canton 1767\u201368). A similar flag, ordered by SOIC director [[Grill (family)#Claes Grill (I)|Claes Grill]], is kept at [[Svindersvik]].<ref>{{cite book |last=S\u00f6derberg|first=Bengt G.|date=1968|title=Slott och herres\u00e4ten i Sverige.

Some of these signals were just for the individual ships and some were used internationally. Sometimes this even included showing flags of other nationalities. Those flags were also used as deception if the ship was where hostile ships could be encountered and the captain wanted to avoid confrontation. There are records of ships from the SOIC approaching land under French or English flag, to collect or buy food in places where Swedish ships were forbidden to anchor.{{sfn|Kjellberg|1975|p=176}}\n\n== The modern Swedish East India Company ==\n\n[[File:Modern SOIC headquarter.jpg|thumb|The modern SOIC headquarter at Pier Four in the [[Port of Gothenburg]] with the ''[[G\u00f6theborg (ship)|G\u00f6theborg]]'' prepared for winter]]\nOn 28{{nbsp}}December 1993, a new company called the ''Svenska Ostindiska Companiet Aktiebolag'' (the Swedish East India Company Limited) was registered.

During his brief rule, he signed the [[Henrician Articles]] into law, recognizing the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]]'s right to [[Royal elections in Poland|freely elect]] their monarch. Aged 22, Henry abandoned Poland upon inheriting the French throne when his brother, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], died without issue.\n\nFrance was at the time plagued by the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], and Henry's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers: the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] (supported by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and the [[Pope]]), the Protestant [[Huguenots]] (supported by [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the Dutch) and the [[Malcontents (France)|Malcontents]], led by Henry's own brother, the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], which was a party of Catholic and Protestant [[French nobility|aristocrats]] who jointly opposed the [[Absolute monarchy in France|absolutist]] ambitions of the king. Henry III was himself a {{lang|fr|[[politique]]}}, arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse.\n\nAfter the death of Henry's younger brother [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir, the Wars of Religion developed into a succession crisis, the [[War of the Three Henrys]]. Henry III's legitimate heir was his distant cousin, King [[Henry III of Navarre]], a Protestant. The Catholic League, led by [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Charles, Cardinal of Bourbon]], as Henry III's heir.\n\nIn 1589, [[Jacques Cl\u00e9ment]], a Catholic fanatic, murdered Henry III. He was succeeded by the King of Navarre who, as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], assumed the throne of France after converting to Catholicism, as the first French king of the [[House of Bourbon]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nHenry was born at the royal [[Chateau Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]], the fourth son of King Henry II and Catherine de' Medici and grandson of [[Francis I of France]] and [[Claude of France]].

Although he was both fond of fencing and skilled in it, he preferred to indulge his tastes for the arts and reading. These predilections were attributed to his Italian mother.\n\nAt one point in his youth he showed a tendency towards Protestantism as a means of rebelling.

Elizabeth, almost 37, was expected by many parties in her country to marry and produce an heir. However, nothing came of these discussions. In initiating them, Elizabeth is viewed by historians as having intended only to arouse the concern of Spain, rather than contemplate marriage seriously. The chance of marriage was further blighted by differing religious views (Henry was Catholic, Elizabeth Protestant) and his opinion of Elizabeth. Henry tactlessly referred to Elizabeth as a ''putain publique'' (public whore) and made stinging remarks about their difference in age (he was 18 years younger). Upon hearing (inaccurately) that she limped because of a [[varicose vein]], he called her an \"old creature with a sore leg\".<ref name=cdm/>\n\n===Wars of Religion===\n[[File:Le Siege de La Rochelle par le Duc d Anjou en 1573.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of La Rochelle (1572\u20131573)|Siege of La Rochelle]] by the Duke of Anjou in 1573 (\"History of Henry III\" tapestry, completed in 1623)]]\n\nPrior to ascending the French throne in 1574, Henry served as a leader of the royal army in the [[French Wars of Religion]], taking part in the victories over [[Huguenots]] at the [[Battle of Jarnac]] (March 1569){{sfn|Knecht|1989|p=41}} and at the [[Battle of Moncontour]] (October 1569).{{sfn|Knecht|1998|p=130}} While still Duke of Anjou, he helped plot the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of 1572. Though Henry did not participate directly, historian [[:fr:Thierry Wanegffelen|Thierry Wanegffelen]] sees him as the royal most responsible for the massacre, which involved the targeted killing of many key Huguenot leaders. Henry III's reign as King of France, like those of his elder brothers Francis and Charles, would see France in constant turmoil over religion.\n\nHenry continued to take an active role in the Wars of Religion, and in 1572/1573 led the [[Siege of La Rochelle (1572\u20131573)|siege of La Rochelle]], a massive military assault on the Huguenot-held city.{{sfn|Knecht|1989|p=54}} At the end of May 1573, Henry learned that the [[Royal elections in Poland|Polish ''szlachta'']] had elected him King of Poland (a country with a large Protestant minority at the time) and political considerations forced him to negotiate an end to the assault. Negotiators reached an agreement on 24 June 1573, and Catholic troops ended the siege on 6 July 1573.\n\n==King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (1573\u20131575)==\n[[File:Aleksander Lesser, Henryk Walezy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish likeness of Henry III, by [[Aleksander Lesser]]]]\n\nFollowing the death of the Polish ruler [[Sigismund II Augustus]] on 7 July 1572, [[Jean de Monluc]] was sent as the French envoy to Poland to negotiate the election of Henry to the Polish throne in exchange for military support against Russia, diplomatic assistance in dealing with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and financial subsidies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH9Rkw4Yl8EC&pg=PA80 |title='&#39;Theodore Beza and the quest for peace in France, 1572\u20131598'&#39;|first=Scott M.|last=Manetsch|page=80|publisher=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 1573, Polish nobles chose Henry as the first elected monarch of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

The Order would retain its prestige as the premier [[chivalric order]] of France until the end of the French monarchy.\n\n==French reign (1575\u20131589)==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n\nHenry was crowned king of France on 13 February 1575 at [[Notre-Dame de Reims|Reims Cathedral]]. Although he was expected to produce an heir after he married [[Louise of Lorraine]], age 21, on 14 February 1575, no issue resulted from their union.\n\nIn 1576, Henry signed the [[Edict of Beaulieu]], which granted many concessions to the Huguenots. His action resulted in the Catholic activist Henry I, Duke of Guise, forming the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. After much posturing and negotiations, Henry was forced to rescind most of the concessions that had been made to the Protestants in the edict.\n\n[[File:Henri III 1577.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Henry III, 1577]]\n\nIn 1584, the King's youngest brother and [[heir presumptive]], [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], died. Under [[Salic Law]], the next heir to the throne was Protestant Henry of Navarre, a descendant of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (Saint Louis). Under pressure from the Duke of Guise, Henry III issued an edict suppressing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre's right to the throne.\n\nOn 12 May 1588, when the Duke of Guise entered Paris, an apparently spontaneous [[Day of the Barricades]] erupted in favor of the Catholic champion. Henry III fled the city.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] that summer, the king's fear of Spanish support for the Catholic League apparently waned. Accordingly, on 23 December 1588, at the [[Chateau Blois|Ch\u00e2teau de Blois]], he invited the Duke of Guise to the council chamber where the duke's brother [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], already waited. The duke was told that the king wished to see him in the private room adjoining the royal bedroom. There, royal guardsmen murdered the duke, then the cardinal. To make certain that no contender for the French throne was free to act against him, the king had the [[Charles, Duke of Guise|duke's son]] imprisoned.\n\nThe Duke of Guise had been very popular in France, and the citizenry turned against Henry for the murders. The Parlement instituted criminal charges against the king, and he was compelled to join forces with his heir, the Protestant Henry of Navarre, by setting up the [[Parliament of Tours]].\n\n===Overseas relations===\nUnder Henry, France named the first [[France\u2013Morocco relations|Consul of France in Morocco]] in the person of [[Guillaume B\u00e9rard]].

The monk gave the king a bundle of papers and stated that he had a secret message to deliver. The king signalled for his attendants to step back for privacy, and Cl\u00e9ment whispered in his ear while plunging a knife into his abdomen. Cl\u00e9ment was then killed on the spot by the guards.\n\nAt first, the king's wound did not appear fatal, but he enjoined all the officers around him, in the event that he did not survive, to be loyal to Henry of Navarre as their new king. The following morning, on the day that he was to have launched his assault to retake Paris, Henry III died.\n\nChaos swept the attacking army, most of it quickly melting away; the proposed attack on Paris was postponed. Inside the city, joy at the news of Henry III's death was near delirium; some hailed the assassination as an [[act of God]].<ref>Durant, Will, ''The Age of Reason Begins'', vol.

The co-director, Charles Le Bargy, plays the Duke.\n* The American silent film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) depicts Henry as effeminate but not explicitly homosexual. He is portrayed by the British-born American actor Maxfield Stanley.\n* The French movies ''[[La Reine Margot (1954 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1954) and ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1994), both based on Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re's novel of the same title, are fictional depictions of the lives of Henry III's family, his sister Margot, and her Protestant husband Henry around the time of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]. In the 1994 film, Henry is played by the actor [[Pascal Greggory]]. In Dumas' novel, Henri was not portrayed as homosexual, whereas, in the 1954 film, he was shown as an effeminate, comical queen. In the 1994 film, he was portrayed as a more sinister character, bisexual and showing sexual interest in his sister. His brother dies by being accidentally poisoned by his mother, who had intended to kill Henry of Navarre instead.\n* As the Duke of Anjou, the future Henry III plays a significant role in the French film ''[[The Princess of Montpensier]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Madame de La Fayette]].\n* The film ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'', released in 1998, depicts a fictional courtship between Elizabeth I of England and Henry III while he was still Duke of Anjou. In reality, the two never met and the Queen of England was actually courted nearly ten years later by his younger brother [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou]], when Elizabeth was 46. The film borrows some of the aspects of Henry III's life and features Anjou as a comical foolish transvestite. The role is portrayed by the French actor [[Vincent Cassel]].\n* In the film ''[[Dangerous Beauty]]'', he has an assignation with the main character, the Venetian courtesan [[Veronica Franco]]. Visiting a Venice eager for military aid, the \"French king\" chooses her from among the famous courtesans of that city because he notices her reluctance; placing a blade at her neck, he tells Veronica that the \"rumours\" about him are true (that \"the king is a pervert\"), and the implication is made that Veronica pleases him enormously by first correctly guessing at and then indulging his fetish for BDSM domination.  (When the king emerges from Franco's house in the morning, the assembled Venetian nobility awaiting, he smiles broadly while carefully settling his presumably sore posterior on a pillow, and then declares that the French navy shall assist the Venetians against the Ottoman Empire in defense of their rule of Cyprus.) He is played by the British actor [[Jake Weber]].\n\n===Television===\n* In an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' entitled \"The Three Muska-Warners\", an [[Elmer Fudd]]\u2013like Henri III is protected by [[Yakko, Wakko and Dot]]. In this version, Henri is portrayed by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]] as nervous and jumpy, and for no apparent reason speaks with an [[English accent]].\n* He is also featured in a few episodes in the first and third seasons of the CW show ''[[Reign (TV series)|Reign]]''. In the show's fourth season, Henry is played by Nick Slater. With his brother showing little interest in the job, Spain wants Henry to become France's king.\n\n===Opera===\n* [[Chabrier]]'s [[op\u00e9ra-comique]] ''[[Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui]]'' (1887) deals with the unhappy Polish episode, with Henri as the reluctant King of Poland. In Krak\u00f3w, he conspires with Polish nobles to depose himself. His friend Nangis changes places with him, but in the end, the plot fails and the curtain falls on Henri being crowned.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|LGBT}}\n* [[Chicot]]\n* [[History of Poland (1569\u20131795)]]\n* [[Les Mignons]]\n* [[Louis Duret]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |title=Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France |volume=1 |trans-title=Genealogical and chronological history of the royal house of France |last=Anselme de Sainte-Marie |first=P\u00e8re |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76026j/f16.image |publisher=La compagnie des libraires |location=Paris |language=fr |edition=3rd |year=1726 |ref={{harvid|Anselme|1726}} }}\n*{{cite book|last=Bordonove|first=Georges|title=Henri III: Roi de France et de Pologne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3_gBAAAQBAJ|year=1988|publisher=Pygmalion|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=978-2-7564-1139-2}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Conihout, Isabelle de |editor2=Maillard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |editor3=Poirier, Guy  |title=Henri III m\u00e9c\u00e8ne: des arts, des sciences et des lettres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OH8mNm_OR00C|year=2006|publisher=Presses Paris Sorbonne|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=978-2-84050-431-3}}\n* Crawford, Katherine B., \"Love, Sodomy, and Scandal: Controlling the Sexual Reputation of Henry III\", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'', vol. 12 (2003), 513\u201342\n*{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=The Age of Reason Begins|volume=VII|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1961}}\n*{{cite book|last=Freer|first=Martha Walker|authorlink=Martha Walker Freer|title=Henry III, King of France and Poland: his court and times|location=New York|publisher=Dodd, Mead|year=1888|url=https://archive.org/details/henryiiikingoffr01freeuoft}}\n*{{cite book|last=Grzybowski|first=Stanis\u0142aw|title=Henryk Walezy|location=Warsaw|publisher=Zak\u0142ad Narodowy im.

\u00c9douard de France}}, {{lang-pl|Henryk Walezy}}, {{lang-lt|Henrikas Valua}}) was [[List of French monarchs|King of France]] from 1574 until his death and also King of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from 1573 to 1575. \n\nAs the fourth son of King [[Henry II of France]], he was not expected to inherit the [[Kingdom of France|French]] throne and thus was a good candidate for the vacant throne of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he was elected [[List of Polish rulers#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|King]]/[[List of Lithuanian rulers#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Grand Duke]] in 1573. During his brief rule, he signed the [[Henrician Articles]] into law, recognizing the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]]'s right to [[Royal elections in Poland|freely elect]] their monarch. Aged 22, Henry abandoned Poland upon inheriting the French throne when his brother, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], died without issue.\n\nFrance was at the time plagued by the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], and Henry's authority was undermined by violent political parties funded by foreign powers: the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] (supported by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and the [[Pope]]), the Protestant [[Huguenots]] (supported by [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the Dutch) and the [[Malcontents (France)|Malcontents]], led by Henry's own brother, the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], which was a party of Catholic and Protestant [[French nobility|aristocrats]] who jointly opposed the [[Absolute monarchy in France|absolutist]] ambitions of the king. Henry III was himself a {{lang|fr|[[politique]]}}, arguing that a strong and religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse.\n\nAfter the death of Henry's younger brother [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], and when it became apparent that Henry would not produce an heir, the Wars of Religion developed into a succession crisis, the [[War of the Three Henrys]]. Henry III's legitimate heir was his distant cousin, King [[Henry III of Navarre]], a Protestant. The Catholic League, led by [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], sought to exclude Protestants from the succession and championed the Catholic [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Charles, Cardinal of Bourbon]], as Henry III's heir.\n\nIn 1589, [[Jacques Cl\u00e9ment]], a Catholic fanatic, murdered Henry III. He was succeeded by the King of Navarre who, as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], assumed the throne of France after converting to Catholicism, as the first French king of the [[House of Bourbon]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\nHenry was born at the royal [[Chateau Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]], the fourth son of King Henry II and Catherine de' Medici and grandson of [[Francis I of France]] and [[Claude of France]]. His older brothers were [[Francis II of France]], [[Charles IX of France]], and [[Louis of Valois]]. He was made [[Duke of Angoul\u00eame]] and [[Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1560, then [[Duke of Anjou]] in 1566.\n\nHe was his mother's favourite; she called him ''chers yeux'' (\"precious eyes\") and lavished fondness and affection upon him for most of his life.{{sfn|Mari\u00e9jol|1920|p=204}} His elder brother, Charles, grew to detest him, partially because he resented his better health.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe royal children were raised under the supervision of [[Diane de Poitiers]].{{sfn|Wellman|2013|p=209}}\n\n===Youth===\nIn his youth, Henry was considered the best of the sons of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wNn3BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=In+his+youth,+Henry+was+considered+the+best+of+the+sons+of+Catherine+de'+Medici+and+Henry+II&source=bl&ots=ewkLOSIlco&sig=yrcp-w01rRy4coX3VhTYLieigZI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwia6aTxj9zRAhUFKpQKHY0_DZUQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=In%20his%20youth,%20Henry%20was%20considered%20the%20best%20of%20the%20sons%20of%20Catherine%20de'%20Medici%20and%20Henry%20II&f=false|title=The Assassins}}</ref> Unlike his father and elder brothers, he had little interest in the traditional Valois pastimes of hunting and physical exercise. Although he was both fond of fencing and skilled in it, he preferred to indulge his tastes for the arts and reading. These predilections were attributed to his Italian mother.\n\nAt one point in his youth he showed a tendency towards Protestantism as a means of rebelling. At the age of nine, calling himself \"a little Huguenot\", he refused to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], sang Protestant [[psalm]]s to his sister [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] (exhorting her all the while to change her religion and cast her [[Book of Hours]] into the fire), and even bit the nose off a statue of [[St. Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]. His mother firmly cautioned her children against such behaviour, and he would never again show any Protestant tendencies.

Elizabeth, almost 37, was expected by many parties in her country to marry and produce an heir. However, nothing came of these discussions. In initiating them, Elizabeth is viewed by historians as having intended only to arouse the concern of Spain, rather than contemplate marriage seriously. The chance of marriage was further blighted by differing religious views (Henry was Catholic, Elizabeth Protestant) and his opinion of Elizabeth. Henry tactlessly referred to Elizabeth as a ''putain publique'' (public whore) and made stinging remarks about their difference in age (he was 18 years younger). Upon hearing (inaccurately) that she limped because of a [[varicose vein]], he called her an \"old creature with a sore leg\".<ref name=cdm/>\n\n===Wars of Religion===\n[[File:Le Siege de La Rochelle par le Duc d Anjou en 1573.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of La Rochelle (1572\u20131573)|Siege of La Rochelle]] by the Duke of Anjou in 1573 (\"History of Henry III\" tapestry, completed in 1623)]]\n\nPrior to ascending the French throne in 1574, Henry served as a leader of the royal army in the [[French Wars of Religion]], taking part in the victories over [[Huguenots]] at the [[Battle of Jarnac]] (March 1569){{sfn|Knecht|1989|p=41}} and at the [[Battle of Moncontour]] (October 1569).{{sfn|Knecht|1998|p=130}} While still Duke of Anjou, he helped plot the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of 1572. Though Henry did not participate directly, historian [[:fr:Thierry Wanegffelen|Thierry Wanegffelen]] sees him as the royal most responsible for the massacre, which involved the targeted killing of many key Huguenot leaders. Henry III's reign as King of France, like those of his elder brothers Francis and Charles, would see France in constant turmoil over religion.\n\nHenry continued to take an active role in the Wars of Religion, and in 1572/1573 led the [[Siege of La Rochelle (1572\u20131573)|siege of La Rochelle]], a massive military assault on the Huguenot-held city.{{sfn|Knecht|1989|p=54}} At the end of May 1573, Henry learned that the [[Royal elections in Poland|Polish ''szlachta'']] had elected him King of Poland (a country with a large Protestant minority at the time) and political considerations forced him to negotiate an end to the assault. Negotiators reached an agreement on 24 June 1573, and Catholic troops ended the siege on 6 July 1573.\n\n==King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (1573\u20131575)==\n[[File:Aleksander Lesser, Henryk Walezy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish likeness of Henry III, by [[Aleksander Lesser]]]]\n\nFollowing the death of the Polish ruler [[Sigismund II Augustus]] on 7 July 1572, [[Jean de Monluc]] was sent as the French envoy to Poland to negotiate the election of Henry to the Polish throne in exchange for military support against Russia, diplomatic assistance in dealing with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and financial subsidies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH9Rkw4Yl8EC&pg=PA80 |title='&#39;Theodore Beza and the quest for peace in France, 1572\u20131598'&#39;|first=Scott M.|last=Manetsch|page=80|publisher=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 1573, Polish nobles chose Henry as the first elected monarch of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

The Order would retain its prestige as the premier [[chivalric order]] of France until the end of the French monarchy.\n\n==French reign (1575\u20131589)==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\n\nHenry was crowned king of France on 13 February 1575 at [[Notre-Dame de Reims|Reims Cathedral]]. Although he was expected to produce an heir after he married [[Louise of Lorraine]], age 21, on 14 February 1575, no issue resulted from their union.\n\nIn 1576, Henry signed the [[Edict of Beaulieu]], which granted many concessions to the Huguenots. His action resulted in the Catholic activist Henry I, Duke of Guise, forming the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. After much posturing and negotiations, Henry was forced to rescind most of the concessions that had been made to the Protestants in the edict.\n\n[[File:Henri III 1577.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Henry III, 1577]]\n\nIn 1584, the King's youngest brother and [[heir presumptive]], [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], died. Under [[Salic Law]], the next heir to the throne was Protestant Henry of Navarre, a descendant of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (Saint Louis). Under pressure from the Duke of Guise, Henry III issued an edict suppressing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre's right to the throne.\n\nOn 12 May 1588, when the Duke of Guise entered Paris, an apparently spontaneous [[Day of the Barricades]] erupted in favor of the Catholic champion. Henry III fled the city.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] that summer, the king's fear of Spanish support for the Catholic League apparently waned. Accordingly, on 23 December 1588, at the [[Chateau Blois|Ch\u00e2teau de Blois]], he invited the Duke of Guise to the council chamber where the duke's brother [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], already waited. The duke was told that the king wished to see him in the private room adjoining the royal bedroom. There, royal guardsmen murdered the duke, then the cardinal. To make certain that no contender for the French throne was free to act against him, the king had the [[Charles, Duke of Guise|duke's son]] imprisoned.\n\nThe Duke of Guise had been very popular in France, and the citizenry turned against Henry for the murders. The Parlement instituted criminal charges against the king, and he was compelled to join forces with his heir, the Protestant Henry of Navarre, by setting up the [[Parliament of Tours]].\n\n===Overseas relations===\nUnder Henry, France named the first [[France\u2013Morocco relations|Consul of France in Morocco]] in the person of [[Guillaume B\u00e9rard]]. The request came from the Moroccan prince [[Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi|Abd al-Malik]], who had been saved by B\u00e9rard, a doctor by profession, during an epidemic in [[History of Istanbul#Imperial capital|Constantinople]] and wished to retain B\u00e9rard in his service.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h97ivaPeOx8C&pg=PA277|title='&#39;Cervantes in Algiers: a captive's tale'&#39|author=Garc\u00e9s, Mar\u00eda Antonia|page=277 note 39|publisher=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nHenry III encouraged the exploration and development of [[New World]] territories.

The monk gave the king a bundle of papers and stated that he had a secret message to deliver. The king signalled for his attendants to step back for privacy, and Cl\u00e9ment whispered in his ear while plunging a knife into his abdomen. Cl\u00e9ment was then killed on the spot by the guards.\n\nAt first, the king's wound did not appear fatal, but he enjoined all the officers around him, in the event that he did not survive, to be loyal to Henry of Navarre as their new king. The following morning, on the day that he was to have launched his assault to retake Paris, Henry III died.\n\nChaos swept the attacking army, most of it quickly melting away; the proposed attack on Paris was postponed. Inside the city, joy at the news of Henry III's death was near delirium; some hailed the assassination as an [[act of God]].<ref>Durant, Will, ''The Age of Reason Begins'', vol. VII, (Simon and Schuster, 1961), p. 361.</ref>\n\nHenry III was interred at the [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. Childless, he was the longest-living of Henry II's sons to have become king and also the last of the Valois kings.

Parris]] ''Conspiracy'' (2015)\n\n===Film===\n* The French short film ''[[The Assassination of the Duke de Guise]]'' (1908) shows the Duke's assassination but not the Cardinal's. The co-director, Charles Le Bargy, plays the Duke.\n* The American silent film ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) depicts Henry as effeminate but not explicitly homosexual. He is portrayed by the British-born American actor Maxfield Stanley.\n* The French movies ''[[La Reine Margot (1954 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1954) and ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1994), both based on Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re's novel of the same title, are fictional depictions of the lives of Henry III's family, his sister Margot, and her Protestant husband Henry around the time of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]. In the 1994 film, Henry is played by the actor [[Pascal Greggory]]. In Dumas' novel, Henri was not portrayed as homosexual, whereas, in the 1954 film, he was shown as an effeminate, comical queen. In the 1994 film, he was portrayed as a more sinister character, bisexual and showing sexual interest in his sister. His brother dies by being accidentally poisoned by his mother, who had intended to kill Henry of Navarre instead.\n* As the Duke of Anjou, the future Henry III plays a significant role in the French film ''[[The Princess of Montpensier]]'', based on the novel of the same title by [[Madame de La Fayette]].\n* The film ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'', released in 1998, depicts a fictional courtship between Elizabeth I of England and Henry III while he was still Duke of Anjou. In reality, the two never met and the Queen of England was actually courted nearly ten years later by his younger brother [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou]], when Elizabeth was 46. The film borrows some of the aspects of Henry III's life and features Anjou as a comical foolish transvestite. The role is portrayed by the French actor [[Vincent Cassel]].\n* In the film ''[[Dangerous Beauty]]'', he has an assignation with the main character, the Venetian courtesan [[Veronica Franco]]. Visiting a Venice eager for military aid, the \"French king\" chooses her from among the famous courtesans of that city because he notices her reluctance; placing a blade at her neck, he tells Veronica that the \"rumours\" about him are true (that \"the king is a pervert\"), and the implication is made that Veronica pleases him enormously by first correctly guessing at and then indulging his fetish for BDSM domination.  (When the king emerges from Franco's house in the morning, the assembled Venetian nobility awaiting, he smiles broadly while carefully settling his presumably sore posterior on a pillow, and then declares that the French navy shall assist the Venetians against the Ottoman Empire in defense of their rule of Cyprus.) He is played by the British actor [[Jake Weber]].\n\n===Television===\n* In an episode of ''[[Animaniacs]]'' entitled \"The Three Muska-Warners\", an [[Elmer Fudd]]\u2013like Henri III is protected by [[Yakko, Wakko and Dot]]. In this version, Henri is portrayed by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]] as nervous and jumpy, and for no apparent reason speaks with an [[English accent]].\n* He is also featured in a few episodes in the first and third seasons of the CW show ''[[Reign (TV series)|Reign]]''. In the show's fourth season, Henry is played by Nick Slater. With his brother showing little interest in the job, Spain wants Henry to become France's king.\n\n===Opera===\n* [[Chabrier]]'s [[op\u00e9ra-comique]] ''[[Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui]]'' (1887) deals with the unhappy Polish episode, with Henri as the reluctant King of Poland. In Krak\u00f3w, he conspires with Polish nobles to depose himself. His friend Nangis changes places with him, but in the end, the plot fails and the curtain falls on Henri being crowned.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|LGBT}}\n* [[Chicot]]\n* [[History of Poland (1569\u20131795)]]\n* [[Les Mignons]]\n* [[Louis Duret]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |title=Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9alogique et chronologique de la maison royale de France |volume=1 |trans-title=Genealogical and chronological history of the royal house of France |last=Anselme de Sainte-Marie |first=P\u00e8re |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k76026j/f16.image |publisher=La compagnie des libraires |location=Paris |language=fr |edition=3rd |year=1726 |ref={{harvid|Anselme|1726}} }}\n*{{cite book|last=Bordonove|first=Georges|title=Henri III: Roi de France et de Pologne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3_gBAAAQBAJ|year=1988|publisher=Pygmalion|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=978-2-7564-1139-2}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Conihout, Isabelle de |editor2=Maillard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois |editor3=Poirier, Guy  |title=Henri III m\u00e9c\u00e8ne: des arts, des sciences et des lettres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OH8mNm_OR00C|year=2006|publisher=Presses Paris Sorbonne|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=978-2-84050-431-3}}\n* Crawford, Katherine B., \"Love, Sodomy, and Scandal: Controlling the Sexual Reputation of Henry III\", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'', vol. 12 (2003), 513\u201342\n*{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=The Age of Reason Begins|volume=VII|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1961}}\n*{{cite book|last=Freer|first=Martha Walker|authorlink=Martha Walker Freer|title=Henry III, King of France and Poland: his court and times|location=New York|publisher=Dodd, Mead|year=1888|url=https://archive.org/details/henryiiikingoffr01freeuoft}}\n*{{cite book|last=Grzybowski|first=Stanis\u0142aw|title=Henryk Walezy|location=Warsaw|publisher=Zak\u0142ad Narodowy im.

Founded in 1914 by several leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], it attempted to find a balance between a humanitarian progressivism and an intellectual scientism, and ultimately discarded the latter.<ref>Nuechterlein, James A. \"The Dream of Scientific Liberalism: The 'New Republic' and American Progressive Thought, 1914\u20131920].

He wrote that \"its love letters to the Bernie Bro and Millennial Marxist movements and its attacks on Hillary and the Democratic establishment from the left, instead of from the right, bring back memories of its decidedly radical days in the '30s and '40s\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-new-republics-super-buzzy-lefty-upgrade |last= Davidson |first= Telly |title=The New Republic\u2019s Super Buzzy, Lefty Upgrade|journal=[[The American Conservative]] |date=August 31, 2017 |accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n''The New Republic'' was founded by [[Herbert Croly]], [[Walter Lippmann]], and [[Walter Weyl]] through the financial backing of heiress [[Dorothy Payne Whitney]] and her husband, [[Willard Straight]], who maintained majority ownership. The magazine's first issue was published on November 7, 1914. The magazine's politics were [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Progressive Movement|progressive]], and as such concerned with coping with the great changes brought about by middle-class reform efforts designed to remedy the weaknesses in America's changing economy and society. The magazine is widely considered important in changing the character of liberalism in the direction of governmental interventionism, both foreign and domestic. Amongst the most important of these was the emergence of the U.S. as a [[great power]] on the international scene. In 1917, ''TNR'' urged America's entry into [[World War I|the Great War]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].\n\nOne consequence of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. During the inter-war years, the magazine was generally positive in its assessment of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. However, the magazine changed its position after the [[Cold War]] began in 1947, and in 1948 its leftist editor, [[Henry A. Wallace]], departed to run for president on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] ticket. After Wallace, ''TNR'' moved toward positions more typical of mainstream American liberalism. Throughout the 1950s, the publication was critical of both Soviet foreign policy and domestic [[anti-communism]], particularly [[McCarthyism]]. During the 1960s, the magazine opposed the [[Vietnam War]], but was also often critical of the [[New Left]].\n\nUp until the late 1960s, the magazine had a certain \"cachet as the voice of re-invigorated liberalism\", in the opinion of commentator Eric Alterman. He has criticized the magazine's politics from the left. That cachet, Alterman wrote, \"was perhaps best illustrated when the dashing, young President Kennedy had been photographed boarding Air Force One holding a copy\".<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Peretz ownership and eventual editorship, 1974\u20131979===\nIn March 1974, the magazine was purchased for $380,000<ref name=ea/> by [[Martin Peretz]], a lecturer at Harvard University,<ref>{{cite web|last=Peretz |first=Martin |title=Three Decades of The New Republic |url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070319&s=peretz031907 |accessdate=March 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313202808/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070319&s=peretz031907 |archivedate=March 13, 2007 }}</ref> from [[Gilbert A. Harrison]].<ref name=ea/> Peretz was a veteran of the [[New Left]] who had broken with the movement over its support of various [[Third World]] liberationist movements, particularly the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]. Harrison continued editing the magazine, expecting Peretz to let him continue running the magazine for three years. But by 1975, when Peretz became annoyed at having his own articles rejected for publication while he was pouring money into the magazine to cover its losses, he fired Harrison. Much of the staff, including [[Walter Pincus]], [[Stanley Karnow]], and [[Doris Grumbach]], was either fired or quit, being replaced largely by recent Harvard graduates lacking in journalistic experience. Peretz became the editor and served in that post until 1979. In 1980 it endorsed the moderate Republican [[John B. Anderson]], running as an independent, rather than the Democratic incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]].  As other editors were appointed,Peretz remained editor-in-chief until 2012.<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Kinsley and Hertzberg editorships, 1979\u20131991===\n[[Michael Kinsley]], a [[neoliberal]] (in the American sense of the term), was editor (1979\u20131981; 1985\u20131989), alternating twice with [[Hendrik Hertzberg]] (1981\u20131985; 1989\u20131991), who has been called \"an old-fashioned social democrat\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Kinsley was only 28 years old when he first became editor, and was still attending law school.<ref name=ea/>\n\nWriters for the magazine during this era included neoliberals [[Mickey Kaus]] and [[Jacob Weisberg]] along with [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]], [[Morton Kondracke]], [[Sidney Blumenthal]], [[Robert Kuttner]], [[Ronald Steel]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Irving Howe]].<ref name=ea/>\n\nDuring the 1980s the magazine generally supported President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s anti-Communist foreign policy, including provision of aid to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]]. The magazine's editors also supported both [[Gulf War]]s and, reflecting its belief in the moral efficacy of American power, intervention in \"humanitarian\" crises, such as those in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] during the [[Yugoslav wars]].\n\nIt was widely considered a \"must read\" across the political spectrum. An article in ''Vanity Fair'' judged ''TNR'' \"the smartest, most impudent weekly in the country,\" and the \"most entertaining and intellectually agile magazine in the country.\" According to Alterman, the magazine's prose could sparkle and the contrasting views within its pages were \"genuinely exciting\". He added, \"The magazine unarguably set the terms of debate for insider political elites during the Reagan era.\"<ref name=ea/>\n\nThe magazine won the respect of many conservative opinion leaders. Twenty copies were sent by messenger to the Reagan White House each Thursday afternoon. [[Norman Podhoretz]] called the magazine \"indispensable\", and [[George Will]] said it was \"currently the nation's most interesting and most important political journal.\" ''[[National Review]]'' described it as \"one of the most interesting magazines in the United States.\"<ref name=ea/>\n\nCredit for its influence was often attributed to Kinsley, whose wit and critical sensibility were seen as enlivening, and Hertzberg, a writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and speechwriter for [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nHertzberg and Kinsley alternated as editor and as the author of the magazine's lead column, \"[[TRB (writer)|TRB from Washington]]\". Its perspective was described as [[Left-wing politics|left-of-center]] in 1988.<ref name=SBFK>Stephenson, D. Grier Jr., Bresler, Robert J., Freidrich, Robert J., Karlesky, Joseph J., editors, ''American Government'', New York: Harper & Row, 1988, {{ISBN|0-06-040947-9}}, pp. 166, 171</ref>\n\nA final ingredient that led to the magazine's increased stature in the 1980s was its \"back of the book\" or literary, cultural and arts pages, which were edited by [[Leon Wieseltier]]. Peretz discovered Wieseltier, then working at Harvard's Society of Fellows, and installed him in charge of the section. Wieseltier reinvented the section along the lines of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', allowing his critics, many of them academics, to write longer, critical essays instead of simple book reviews. Alterman calls the selection of Wieseltier \"probably [...] Peretz's single most significant positive achievement\" in running the magazine. During other changes of editors, Wieseltier remained as cultural editor. Under him the section was \"simultaneously erudite and zestful,\" according to Alterman.\"<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Sullivan editorship, 1991\u20131996===\nIn 1991, [[Andrew Sullivan]], a 28-year-old gay, self-described conservative from Britain, became editor. He took the magazine in a somewhat more conservative direction, though the majority of writers remained liberal or neoliberal. Hertzberg soon left the magazine to return to ''The New Yorker''. Kinsley left the magazine in 1996 to found the online magazine ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.<ref name=ea/>\n\nIn 1994, Sullivan invited [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] to contribute a 10,000-word article, excerpted from his coauthored book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. The article, which contended that \"African Americans score differently from whites on standardized tests of cognitive ability\" proved to be very controversial; it was published in a special issue together with many responses and critiques.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120887/race-genes-and-iq-new-republics-bell-curve-excerpt|title=Race, Genes and I.Q. \u2014 An Apologia|last=Herrnstein|first=Charles Murray and Richard|date=1994-10-31|website=New Republic|access-date=2016-08-21}}</ref> The magazine also published a very critical article by [[Elizabeth McCaughey]] about the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]], commonly known as \"Hillarycare\" due to its close association with First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]]. Alterman described this article as \"dishonest, misinformed\", and \"the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire Clinton presidency\",<ref name=\"ea\" /> while [[James Fallows]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' noted the article's inaccuracies and said that \"The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which ''The New Republic'' did not run.

After the Shalit scandals, the magazine began using fact-checkers during Sullivan's time as editor. One was [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]]. When later working as a reporter, he was later found to have made up quotes, anecdotes and facts in his own articles.<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Kelly, Lane, Beinart, Foer, Just editorships, 1996\u20132012===\nAfter Sullivan stepped down in 1996, David Greenberg and [[Peter Beinart]] served jointly as Acting Editors. After the 1996 election, [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]] served as editor for a year. During his tenure as editor and afterward, Kelly, who also wrote the [[TRB (writer)|TRB column]], was intensely critical of President Clinton.<ref name=ea/> Writer [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]], who had been a major contributor under Kelly's editorship, was later shown to have falsified and fabricated numerous stories, which was admitted by The New Republic after an investigation by Kelly's successor, [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]]. Kelly had consistently supported Glass during his tenure, including sending scathing letters to those challenging the veracity of Glass's stories.<ref>Bissinger, H.G. (September 1998). \"Shattered Glass\". ''Vanity Fair''(These events were later dramatized in the feature film ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'', adapted from a 1998 report by H.G. Bissinger.).</ref>\n\n[[Charles Lane (journalist)|Chuck Lane]] held the editor's position between 1997 and 1999. During Lane's tenure, the [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]] [[#Stephen Glass scandal|scandal]] occurred. Peretz has written that Lane ultimately \"put the ship back on its course,\" for which Peretz said he was \"immensely grateful.\" But Peretz later fired Lane, who learned of his ouster when a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter called him for a comment.<ref name=ea/> (These events were later dramatized in the feature film ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'', adapted from a 1998 report by H.G. Bissinger.)\n\n[[Peter Beinart]], a third editor who took over when he was 28 years old,<ref name=ea/> followed Lane. He served as editor from 1999 to 2006.\n\nIn the early aughts, the ''TNR'' added the weblogs ''&c.'', ''Iraq'd'', and ''Easterblogg'',  replaced in 2005 with the sole blog ''The Plank''.  ''The Stump'' was added in 2007 and covered the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential Election]].\n\nThe magazine remained well known, with references to it occasionally popping up in popular culture. [[Lisa Simpson]] was once portrayed as a subscriber to ''The New Republic for Kids''. [[Matt Groening]], ''[[The Simpsons]]''' creator, once drew a cover for ''TNR''.<ref>[http://www.unz.org/Pub/NewRepublic-1992nov09 The New Republic, November 9, 1992 Issue], content overview at UNZ.org</ref> In the [[Entourage (Pilot)|pilot episode]] of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]],'' which first aired on July 18, 2004, [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]] asks [[Eric Murphy]]: \"Do you read ''The New Republic''? Well, I do, and it says that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\"\n\n[[Franklin Foer]] took over from Beinart in March 2006. The magazine's first editorial under Foer said, \"We've become more liberal \u2026 We've been encouraging Democrats to dream big again on the environment and economics [...]\".<ref name=ea/> Foer is the brother of novelist [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], author of ''[[Everything Is Illuminated]]'' (2002).\n\nOther prominent writers who edited or wrote for the magazine in these years include senior editor and TRB columnist [[Jonathan Chait]], [[Lawrence F. Kaplan]], [[John Judis]] and [[Spencer Ackerman]].<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Political stances in the Peretz era===\n\nThe New Republic gradually became less and less leftwing in the first two decades of the Peretz era, culminating in the editorship of the \"race realist\" conservative Andrew Sullivan. Writers like Anne Kossedd and Steven Rendall contended that it was not as liberal as it had been before 1974.<ref name=\"Kosseff\">{{cite web |url= http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1970 |last2=Kosseff |first2= Anne |first1= Steve | last1= Rendall | date= September\u2013October 2004 | title=Not Even the New Republic | publisher=Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting }}</ref> The magazine's outlook was associated with the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] and \"[[New Democrats]]\" such as former US President [[Bill Clinton]] and Connecticut Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]], who received the magazine's endorsement in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primary]]. \n\nIn the last decade of Peretz ownership the magazine gradually became more leftwing while still being more moderate and hawkish than conventional liberal periodicals. Typical of some of the policies supported by both ''The New Republic'' and the DLC during the 1990s were increased funding for the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] program and reform of the federal welfare system, and [[supply-side economics]], especially the idea of reducing higher [[marginal income tax rate]]s, which in the later Peretz years received heavy criticism from senior editor [[Jonathan Chait]].<ref name=\"Chait\">{{cite news| last= Chait| first= J. | date= September 10, 2007| title= Feast of the Wingnuts: How economic crackpots devoured American politics| work= The New Republic| volume= 237| pages= 27\u201331}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy stances in the Peretz era===\n\nSupport for [[Israel]] was a strong theme: \"Support for Israel is deep down an expression of America's best view of itself. \"<ref name=\"ea\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=my_marty_peretz_problem_and_ours |last= Alterman | first= Eric |title=My Marty Peretz Problem \u2013 And Ours|journal=[[The American Prospect]] |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 3, 2007}}</ref> According to journalism professor [[Eric Alterman]]:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing has been as consistent about the past 34 years of ''The New Republic'' as the magazine's devotion to Peretz's own understanding of what is good for Israel... It is really not too much to say that almost all of Peretz's political beliefs are subordinate to his commitment to Israel's best interests, and these interests as Peretz defines them almost always involve more war.<ref name=\"ea\" /></blockquote>\n\nUnsigned editorials prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] expressed strong support for military action, citing the threat of [[weapons of mass destruction]] as well as humanitarian concerns.

The magazine's first issue was published on November 7, 1914. The magazine's politics were [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Progressive Movement|progressive]], and as such concerned with coping with the great changes brought about by middle-class reform efforts designed to remedy the weaknesses in America's changing economy and society. The magazine is widely considered important in changing the character of liberalism in the direction of governmental interventionism, both foreign and domestic. Amongst the most important of these was the emergence of the U.S. as a [[great power]] on the international scene. In 1917, ''TNR'' urged America's entry into [[World War I|the Great War]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].\n\nOne consequence of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. During the inter-war years, the magazine was generally positive in its assessment of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. However, the magazine changed its position after the [[Cold War]] began in 1947, and in 1948 its leftist editor, [[Henry A. Wallace]], departed to run for president on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] ticket. After Wallace, ''TNR'' moved toward positions more typical of mainstream American liberalism. Throughout the 1950s, the publication was critical of both Soviet foreign policy and domestic [[anti-communism]], particularly [[McCarthyism]]. During the 1960s, the magazine opposed the [[Vietnam War]], but was also often critical of the [[New Left]].\n\nUp until the late 1960s, the magazine had a certain \"cachet as the voice of re-invigorated liberalism\", in the opinion of commentator Eric Alterman. He has criticized the magazine's politics from the left. That cachet, Alterman wrote, \"was perhaps best illustrated when the dashing, young President Kennedy had been photographed boarding Air Force One holding a copy\".<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Peretz ownership and eventual editorship, 1974\u20131979===\nIn March 1974, the magazine was purchased for $380,000<ref name=ea/> by [[Martin Peretz]], a lecturer at Harvard University,<ref>{{cite web|last=Peretz |first=Martin |title=Three Decades of The New Republic |url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070319&s=peretz031907 |accessdate=March 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313202808/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070319&s=peretz031907 |archivedate=March 13, 2007 }}</ref> from [[Gilbert A. Harrison]].<ref name=ea/> Peretz was a veteran of the [[New Left]] who had broken with the movement over its support of various [[Third World]] liberationist movements, particularly the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]. Harrison continued editing the magazine, expecting Peretz to let him continue running the magazine for three years. But by 1975, when Peretz became annoyed at having his own articles rejected for publication while he was pouring money into the magazine to cover its losses, he fired Harrison. Much of the staff, including [[Walter Pincus]], [[Stanley Karnow]], and [[Doris Grumbach]], was either fired or quit, being replaced largely by recent Harvard graduates lacking in journalistic experience. Peretz became the editor and served in that post until 1979. In 1980 it endorsed the moderate Republican [[John B. Anderson]], running as an independent, rather than the Democratic incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]].  As other editors were appointed,Peretz remained editor-in-chief until 2012.<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Kinsley and Hertzberg editorships, 1979\u20131991===\n[[Michael Kinsley]], a [[neoliberal]] (in the American sense of the term), was editor (1979\u20131981; 1985\u20131989), alternating twice with [[Hendrik Hertzberg]] (1981\u20131985; 1989\u20131991), who has been called \"an old-fashioned social democrat\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Kinsley was only 28 years old when he first became editor, and was still attending law school.<ref name=ea/>\n\nWriters for the magazine during this era included neoliberals [[Mickey Kaus]] and [[Jacob Weisberg]] along with [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]], [[Morton Kondracke]], [[Sidney Blumenthal]], [[Robert Kuttner]], [[Ronald Steel]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Irving Howe]].<ref name=ea/>\n\nDuring the 1980s the magazine generally supported President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s anti-Communist foreign policy, including provision of aid to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]]. The magazine's editors also supported both [[Gulf War]]s and, reflecting its belief in the moral efficacy of American power, intervention in \"humanitarian\" crises, such as those in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]] during the [[Yugoslav wars]].\n\nIt was widely considered a \"must read\" across the political spectrum. An article in ''Vanity Fair'' judged ''TNR'' \"the smartest, most impudent weekly in the country,\" and the \"most entertaining and intellectually agile magazine in the country.\" According to Alterman, the magazine's prose could sparkle and the contrasting views within its pages were \"genuinely exciting\". He added, \"The magazine unarguably set the terms of debate for insider political elites during the Reagan era.\"<ref name=ea/>\n\nThe magazine won the respect of many conservative opinion leaders. Twenty copies were sent by messenger to the Reagan White House each Thursday afternoon. [[Norman Podhoretz]] called the magazine \"indispensable\", and [[George Will]] said it was \"currently the nation's most interesting and most important political journal.\" ''[[National Review]]'' described it as \"one of the most interesting magazines in the United States.\"<ref name=ea/>\n\nCredit for its influence was often attributed to Kinsley, whose wit and critical sensibility were seen as enlivening, and Hertzberg, a writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and speechwriter for [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nHertzberg and Kinsley alternated as editor and as the author of the magazine's lead column, \"[[TRB (writer)|TRB from Washington]]\". Its perspective was described as [[Left-wing politics|left-of-center]] in 1988.<ref name=SBFK>Stephenson, D. Grier Jr., Bresler, Robert J., Freidrich, Robert J., Karlesky, Joseph J., editors, ''American Government'', New York: Harper & Row, 1988, {{ISBN|0-06-040947-9}}, pp. 166, 171</ref>\n\nA final ingredient that led to the magazine's increased stature in the 1980s was its \"back of the book\" or literary, cultural and arts pages, which were edited by [[Leon Wieseltier]]. Peretz discovered Wieseltier, then working at Harvard's Society of Fellows, and installed him in charge of the section. Wieseltier reinvented the section along the lines of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', allowing his critics, many of them academics, to write longer, critical essays instead of simple book reviews. Alterman calls the selection of Wieseltier \"probably [...] Peretz's single most significant positive achievement\" in running the magazine. During other changes of editors, Wieseltier remained as cultural editor. Under him the section was \"simultaneously erudite and zestful,\" according to Alterman.\"<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Sullivan editorship, 1991\u20131996===\nIn 1991, [[Andrew Sullivan]], a 28-year-old gay, self-described conservative from Britain, became editor. He took the magazine in a somewhat more conservative direction, though the majority of writers remained liberal or neoliberal. Hertzberg soon left the magazine to return to ''The New Yorker''. Kinsley left the magazine in 1996 to found the online magazine ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''.<ref name=ea/>\n\nIn 1994, Sullivan invited [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] to contribute a 10,000-word article, excerpted from his coauthored book ''[[The Bell Curve]]''. The article, which contended that \"African Americans score differently from whites on standardized tests of cognitive ability\" proved to be very controversial; it was published in a special issue together with many responses and critiques.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/120887/race-genes-and-iq-new-republics-bell-curve-excerpt|title=Race, Genes and I.Q. \u2014 An Apologia|last=Herrnstein|first=Charles Murray and Richard|date=1994-10-31|website=New Republic|access-date=2016-08-21}}</ref> The magazine also published a very critical article by [[Elizabeth McCaughey]] about the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]], commonly known as \"Hillarycare\" due to its close association with First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]]. Alterman described this article as \"dishonest, misinformed\", and \"the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire Clinton presidency\",<ref name=\"ea\" /> while [[James Fallows]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' noted the article's inaccuracies and said that \"The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which ''The New Republic'' did not run.

After the Shalit scandals, the magazine began using fact-checkers during Sullivan's time as editor. One was [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]]. When later working as a reporter, he was later found to have made up quotes, anecdotes and facts in his own articles.<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Kelly, Lane, Beinart, Foer, Just editorships, 1996\u20132012===\nAfter Sullivan stepped down in 1996, David Greenberg and [[Peter Beinart]] served jointly as Acting Editors. After the 1996 election, [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]] served as editor for a year. During his tenure as editor and afterward, Kelly, who also wrote the [[TRB (writer)|TRB column]], was intensely critical of President Clinton.<ref name=ea/> Writer [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]], who had been a major contributor under Kelly's editorship, was later shown to have falsified and fabricated numerous stories, which was admitted by The New Republic after an investigation by Kelly's successor, [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]]. Kelly had consistently supported Glass during his tenure, including sending scathing letters to those challenging the veracity of Glass's stories.<ref>Bissinger, H.G.

Bissinger.).</ref>\n\n[[Charles Lane (journalist)|Chuck Lane]] held the editor's position between 1997 and 1999. During Lane's tenure, the [[Stephen Glass (reporter)|Stephen Glass]] [[#Stephen Glass scandal|scandal]] occurred. Peretz has written that Lane ultimately \"put the ship back on its course,\" for which Peretz said he was \"immensely grateful.\" But Peretz later fired Lane, who learned of his ouster when a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter called him for a comment.<ref name=ea/> (These events were later dramatized in the feature film ''[[Shattered Glass (film)|Shattered Glass]]'', adapted from a 1998 report by H.G. Bissinger.)\n\n[[Peter Beinart]], a third editor who took over when he was 28 years old,<ref name=ea/> followed Lane. He served as editor from 1999 to 2006.\n\nIn the early aughts, the ''TNR'' added the weblogs ''&c.'', ''Iraq'd'', and ''Easterblogg'',  replaced in 2005 with the sole blog ''The Plank''.  ''The Stump'' was added in 2007 and covered the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential Election]].\n\nThe magazine remained well known, with references to it occasionally popping up in popular culture. [[Lisa Simpson]] was once portrayed as a subscriber to ''The New Republic for Kids''. [[Matt Groening]], ''[[The Simpsons]]''' creator, once drew a cover for ''TNR''.<ref>[http://www.unz.org/Pub/NewRepublic-1992nov09 The New Republic, November 9, 1992 Issue], content overview at UNZ.org</ref> In the [[Entourage (Pilot)|pilot episode]] of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]],'' which first aired on July 18, 2004, [[Ari Gold (Entourage)|Ari Gold]] asks [[Eric Murphy]]: \"Do you read ''The New Republic''? Well, I do, and it says that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.\"\n\n[[Franklin Foer]] took over from Beinart in March 2006. The magazine's first editorial under Foer said, \"We've become more liberal \u2026 We've been encouraging Democrats to dream big again on the environment and economics [...]\".<ref name=ea/> Foer is the brother of novelist [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], author of ''[[Everything Is Illuminated]]'' (2002).\n\nOther prominent writers who edited or wrote for the magazine in these years include senior editor and TRB columnist [[Jonathan Chait]], [[Lawrence F. Kaplan]], [[John Judis]] and [[Spencer Ackerman]].<ref name=ea/>\n\n===Political stances in the Peretz era===\n\nThe New Republic gradually became less and less leftwing in the first two decades of the Peretz era, culminating in the editorship of the \"race realist\" conservative Andrew Sullivan. Writers like Anne Kossedd and Steven Rendall contended that it was not as liberal as it had been before 1974.<ref name=\"Kosseff\">{{cite web |url= http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1970 |last2=Kosseff |first2= Anne |first1= Steve | last1= Rendall | date= September\u2013October 2004 | title=Not Even the New Republic | publisher=Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting }}</ref> The magazine's outlook was associated with the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] and \"[[New Democrats]]\" such as former US President [[Bill Clinton]] and Connecticut Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]], who received the magazine's endorsement in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primary]]. \n\nIn the last decade of Peretz ownership the magazine gradually became more leftwing while still being more moderate and hawkish than conventional liberal periodicals. Typical of some of the policies supported by both ''The New Republic'' and the DLC during the 1990s were increased funding for the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]] program and reform of the federal welfare system, and [[supply-side economics]], especially the idea of reducing higher [[marginal income tax rate]]s, which in the later Peretz years received heavy criticism from senior editor [[Jonathan Chait]].<ref name=\"Chait\">{{cite news| last= Chait| first= J. | date= September 10, 2007| title= Feast of the Wingnuts: How economic crackpots devoured American politics| work= The New Republic| volume= 237| pages= 27\u201331}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy stances in the Peretz era===\n\nSupport for [[Israel]] was a strong theme: \"Support for Israel is deep down an expression of America's best view of itself. \"<ref name=\"ea\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=my_marty_peretz_problem_and_ours |last= Alterman | first= Eric |title=My Marty Peretz Problem \u2013 And Ours|journal=[[The American Prospect]] |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 3, 2007}}</ref> According to journalism professor [[Eric Alterman]]:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing has been as consistent about the past 34 years of ''The New Republic'' as the magazine's devotion to Peretz's own understanding of what is good for Israel... It is really not too much to say that almost all of Peretz's political beliefs are subordinate to his commitment to Israel's best interests, and these interests as Peretz defines them almost always involve more war.<ref name=\"ea\" /></blockquote>\n\nUnsigned editorials prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] expressed strong support for military action, citing the threat of [[weapons of mass destruction]] as well as humanitarian concerns. In the first years of the war, while critical of the handling of the war, editorials continued to justify the invasion on humanitarian grounds, but no longer maintained that Iraq's WMD facilities posed any threat to the United States. In the November 27, 2006 issue, the editors wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this point, it seems almost beside the point to say this: ''The New Republic'' deeply regrets its early support for this war.

The magazine described its publication schedule as \"biweekly,\" with specified \"skipped publication dates.\" There were ten of these in 2010.\n* ''New design and layout'': Issues featured more visuals, new art and other \"reader friendly\" content. Warnock typeface throughout was accented by woodcut-style illustrations.\n* ''More pages and bigger size'': Issues became bigger and contained more pages.\n* ''Improved paper'': Covers and pages became sturdier.\n* ''Increased newsstand price'': Although the subscription prices did not change, the newsstand price increased from $3.95 to $4.95.\n* ''Website redesign'': The website offered more daily content and new features.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tnr.com/change/ |work=The New Republic |title=Frequency Change FAQ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227123518/http://www.tnr.com/change/ |archivedate=February 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Katharine Q.

There are numerous instances where a song's performer(s) will not be its writer(s), but there are awards specifically for songwriters, like the Grammys for \"Song of the Year\", \"Best Country Song\" and \"Best R&B Song\".) -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Presenter\n!Awards\n!Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2004\n|[[MTV Video Music Award]]||Best New Artist \u2013 \"Leave (Get Out)\"||{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Billboard Music Awards]]<ref>{{cite news|title=2004 Billboard Music Awards Finalists|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65464/2004-billboard-music-awards-finalists |newspaper=Billboard |date=November 30, 2004 |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n|Female New Artist of the Year||{{nom}}\n|-\n|Mainstream Top 40 Single of the Year \u2013 \"Leave (Get Out)\"||{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Radio Disney Music Awards]]||Best Female Artist \u2013 \"Leave (Get Out)\"||{{nom}}\n|-\n|Best Video That Rocks \u2013 \"Leave (Get Out)\"||{{won}}\n|-\n|2005\n|[[Radio Disney Music Awards]]||Best Female Artist||{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|2006\n|[[Teen Choice Award]] ||Female Choice Breakout \u2013 ''Aquamarine''||{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|[[Radio Disney Music Awards]]||Best Artist Or Song Your Teacher Likes \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{won}}\n|-\n|Favorite Karaoke Song \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{won}}\n|-\n|Best True Ringer Ring Tone \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{nom}}\n|-\n|Best Song to Wake Up To \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{nom}}\n|-\n|Best Song You've Heard a Million Times and Still Love \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2007\n|[[Boston Music Awards]]||National Female of The Year \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{won}}\n|-\n|Hollywood Life 9th Annual Young Hollywood Awards||Breakthrough performance||{{won}}\n|-\n|[[Young Artist Awards]]||Best Performance in a Feature Film \u2013 ''Aquamarine''||{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2008\n|Yahoo Music Awards||for over 10,000,000 downloads \u2013 \"Too Little, Too Late\"||{{won}}\n|-\n|Boston Music Awards||Outstanding Pop/R&B Act of the Year||{{nom}}\n|-\n|2009\n|Poptastic Award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.80millionmoviesfree.com/celebrity/popstar-announces-the-8th-annual-poptastic-awards|title=Popstar!
