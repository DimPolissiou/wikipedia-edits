They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream. This means that any \"Fedora-only\" licenses, or licenses with specific terms that Red Hat or Fedora meets but that other recipients would not are not acceptable (and almost certainly non-free, as a result).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] project that provided extra software for the [[Red Hat Linux]] distribution, and from the characteristic [[fedora]] hat used in Red Hat's \"Shadowman\" logo. Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate project at the [[University of Hawaii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=//fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Wtogami?rd=WarrenTogami|title=Warren Togami|publisher=fedoraproject.org}}</ref> intended to provide a single [[Software repository|repository]] for well-tested third-party software packages so that non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use. The key difference between Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that Fedora's repository development would be collaborative with the global volunteer community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/31767|title=Warren Togami on the new Fedora Project|last=Barr|first=Joe|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Linux.com|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref> Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project, carrying with it this collaborative approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|title=Why Fedora?|last=Togami|first=Warren|date=February 2006|format=ODP|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831065506/http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|archive-date=31 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFedora Linux was launched in 2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued.<ref name=\"newdirection\">{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2003-September/msg00064.html | title=Fedora Project: Announcing New Direction | date=22 September 2003 | accessdate=18 October 2007 | mailinglist=Fedora development | last=Johnson | first=Michael K.}}</ref> [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was to be Red Hat's only officially supported Linux distribution, while Fedora was to be a community distribution.<ref name=\"newdirection\" /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | title=The Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, part 4 | last=Burke | first=Tim | publisher=Red Hat | series=Red Hat Magazine, Issue #22 | date=August 2006 | access-date=18 October 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012162113/http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | archive-date=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore Fedora 7, Fedora was called Fedora Core after the name of one of the two main software repositories - Core and Extras.

Fedora Extras, the secondary repository that had been included since Fedora Core 3, was community-maintained and not distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs.

They are intended for special cases and/or expert users that want to have custom installations or configuring Fedora from scratch.\nIn addition, all acceptable licenses for Fedora (including copyright, trademark, and patent licenses) must be applicable not only to Red Hat or Fedora, but also to all recipients downstream. This means that any \"Fedora-only\" licenses, or licenses with specific terms that Red Hat or Fedora meets but that other recipients would not are not acceptable (and almost certainly non-free, as a result).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] project that provided extra software for the [[Red Hat Linux]] distribution, and from the characteristic [[fedora]] hat used in Red Hat's \"Shadowman\" logo. Warren Togami began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate project at the [[University of Hawaii]],<ref>{{cite web|url=//fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Wtogami?rd=WarrenTogami|title=Warren Togami|publisher=fedoraproject.org}}</ref> intended to provide a single [[Software repository|repository]] for well-tested third-party software packages so that non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use. The key difference between Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that Fedora's repository development would be collaborative with the global volunteer community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/31767|title=Warren Togami on the new Fedora Project|last=Barr|first=Joe|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Linux.com|accessdate=9 February 2010}}</ref> Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project, carrying with it this collaborative approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|title=Why Fedora?|last=Togami|first=Warren|date=February 2006|format=ODP|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831065506/http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp|archive-date=31 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFedora Linux was launched in 2003, when Red Hat Linux was discontinued.<ref name=\"newdirection\">{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2003-September/msg00064.html | title=Fedora Project: Announcing New Direction | date=22 September 2003 | accessdate=18 October 2007 | mailinglist=Fedora development | last=Johnson | first=Michael K.}}</ref> [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was to be Red Hat's only officially supported Linux distribution, while Fedora was to be a community distribution.<ref name=\"newdirection\" /> Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | title=The Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, part 4 | last=Burke | first=Tim | publisher=Red Hat | series=Red Hat Magazine, Issue #22 | date=August 2006 | access-date=18 October 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012162113/http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | archive-date=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBefore Fedora 7, Fedora was called Fedora Core after the name of one of the two main software repositories - Core and Extras.
