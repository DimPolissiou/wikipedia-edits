Central Presbyterian Church was then added to the National Register of Historic Places in Carr\u00e8re.\n\nThe building was designed by architecture firms [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n[[File:First Presbyterian Church of Montclair, 1856.png|alt=Central Presbyterian Church, Montclair, NJ|thumb|Central Presbyterian Church, 1856]]\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary:  Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F. Elizabeth Harris:  Dry Creek, West Virginia\n\nRev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore:  Mainpuri, India\n\nRev. Giacinto J. Reale, Italian Mission:  Montclair, New Jersey\n\n\n''Members engaged in mission work:''\n\nRev. Thomas F. Carter:  Nanhsuchou, China\n\nDr. Edward Mills Dodd:  Tabriz, Persia\n\nPeter Carter Speers:  Lahore, India\n\nJohn L. Mott:  Nagpur, India\n\nJames L. Speers, Jr.:  Nanking, China\n\nDr. and Mrs. William S. Dodd:  Konia, Turkey\n\nMarjorie C. Geary:  Czechoslovakia\n\nDr. Wilson Farnsworth Dodd:  Constantinople, Turkey\n\nMarian Crawford:  Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall:  Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2014, Reverend David C.

Central Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThe building was designed by architects [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n<br />\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary ........................\u00a0 Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F.

Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2010, in response to differing viewpoints with Reverend McNeill and her leadership, the congregation voted to dissolve its relationship with her. Fortunately In, 2011, Reverend Ron Johnson became he church's pastor and helped the divided congregation heal.\n<br />\n\n= Central Presbyterian Church Pastors & Dates of Service \u00a0 =\n'''Called Pastors:'''\n\n1839 - 1843:  Rev.

From an early age, Buck dreamed of becoming a sports announcer with his early exposure to sports broadcasting coming from listening to [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball games announced by [[Fred Hoey]].<ref>[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: pp. 1, 5.</ref>\n\nPart of his childhood coincided with the [[Great Depression]], and Buck remembered his family sometimes using a metal slug to keep a coin-operated gas meter going during the winter to provide heat for their home.<ref>[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: pp. 8-9</ref> In 1939, his family moved to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] to join their father, who had a job with the [[Erie Railroad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: 15</ref> Soon after though, Buck's father died at the age of 49 due to [[uremic poisoning]] related to [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBuck planned to quit high school in 1941 to take a full-time job in an effort to support his family. Dissuaded by one of his teachers, Buck decided to finish high school, graduating from [[Lakewood High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|Lakewood High School]] in the winter of 1942.<ref>[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: 19\u201320</ref> After graduation, he followed one of his friends and began working on an iron ore [[Lake freighter|freight boat]] operated on the [[Great Lakes]] by the [[Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.|Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company]].<ref>[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: pp. 21-24</ref>\n\nBuck served on a {{convert|700|ft|adj=on}} steamer named ''The Sheadle'', where he began as porter and was later promoted to night cook and baker.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: pg. 24</ref> After performing various other shipping related jobs, Buck attempted to become a \"[[Able seaman|deck watch]].\" A physical examination related to the deck watch application process revealed Buck was [[color blindness|color blind]], unable to differentiate between the colors green and brown.<ref>[[#Buc97|Buck, Rains, and Broeg 1997]]: pg. 30</ref> Ineligible for the promotion to deck watch, Buck subsequently became eligible for the military draft, and was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in June&nbsp;1943.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAfter completion of his military service in 1946, Buck enrolled at (and graduated from) [[Ohio State University]]. His early sportscasting career included work for the minor league affiliates of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. In 1954, he was promoted to radio play-by-play of Cardinal games on [[KMOX]], a position that he maintained for nearly all of the next 47 years. He was known in St. Louis for his trademark phrase \"That's a winner!\", which was said after every game that the Cardinals had won.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Cardinals, Buck also earned assignments on many national sportscasts, including radio coverage of 18 [[Super Bowl]]s and 11 [[World Series]]. Some of his famous play-by-play calls include the dramatic walk-off home runs hit by [[Ozzie Smith]] in Game 5 of the [[1985 National League Championship Series]], by [[Kirk Gibson]] in Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]], and by [[Kirby Puckett]] in Game 6 of the [[1991 World Series]].\n\nThe later part of his career found him working side-by-side in the Cardinals booth with his son [[Joe Buck]], who also has risen to national sportscasting prominence.\n\n==Military service==\nAfter graduating from high school, he worked on large shipping boats that traveled the [[Great Lakes]]. Buck was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S.&nbsp;Army]] in June&nbsp;1943.

He worked several jobs while attending college, including one position at an all-night gas station. He&nbsp;crafted his play-by-play skills broadcasting [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State basketball]] games.\n\nAfter college, he called games for the [[Columbus Red Birds]], a [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] ([[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]) affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, in [[1950 in baseball|1950]]\u2013[[1951 in baseball|51]]. He spent the [[1953 in baseball|1953]] season as voice of another AAA Cardinals affiliate, the [[International League]] [[Rochester Red Wings]] on WHEC (AM). His work there earned him an invitation to join the big-league Cardinals' broadcast team in St. Louis the following season.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n\n===St. Louis Cardinals===\n{{MLBBioHon\n|Image = CardsRetiredMic.png\n|Name  = Jack Buck\n|Team  = St. Louis Cardinals\n|Year  = 2002\n|}}\nBuck started broadcasting Cardinals games for [[KMOX (AM)|KMOX]] radio in [[1954 St. Louis Cardinals season|1954]], teaming with [[Harry Caray]], [[Milo Hamilton]] (1954), and [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] (from [[1955 St. Louis Cardinals season|1955]]). Buck was dropped from the Cardinals booth in [[1959 St. Louis Cardinals season|1959]] to make room for [[Buddy Blattner]]; the following [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals season|year]], he called Saturday ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' telecasts for [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]. Buck was re-hired by the Cardinals in [[1961 St. Louis Cardinals season|1961]] after Blattner departed; Garagiola left the following year, leaving Caray and Buck as the team's broadcast voices through [[1969 St. Louis Cardinals season|1969]].\n[[File:Kmox radio baseball.jpg|thumb|right|Buck and Shannon announcing a [[1992 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] game at Busch, 1992]]\nAfter Caray was fired by the Cardinals following the 1969 season, Buck ascended to the team's lead play-by-play role (1969 was also the year that Jack Buck divorced his first wife Alyce Larson&mdash;whom he had married in 1948 and had six children with&mdash;and married his second wife, Carole Lintzenich, who gave birth to their son [[Joe Buck]] in the same year).\n\n{{quote box\n|width=30%\n|align=right\n|quote=[[Ozzie Smith|Smith]] corks one into right, down the line!

In [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals season|1972]], retired Cardinals third baseman [[Mike Shannon]] joined Buck in the broadcast booth, beginning a 28-year partnership. On Cardinals broadcasts, Buck routinely punctuated St. Louis victories with the expression, ''\"That's a winner!\"''\n\nIn addition to Joe, Buck has three daughters who worked in broadcasting. Two are from his first marriage - Bonnie Buck, who currently works in television in Los Angeles, and Christine Buck, who started her career at [[KPLR-TV]] in St. Louis. From his second marriage is Julie Buck on [[KYKY]] 98.1 in St. Louis (she now works at [KTRS-AM 550], also in St. Louis). In addition, Buck's late younger brother, [[Bob Buck]] was a sportscaster and sports director at KMOX/[[KMOV]]-TV in St. Louis.\n\nBuck was well respected in the St. Louis community, where he lived and regularly volunteered time to host charity events. In addition to his sportscasting work, Buck served as the original host of the KMOX interview/call-in program ''At Your Service'' beginning in 1960. His guests on the program included [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/06/13/jack-buck-introduces-first-at-your-service-program-on-kmox/|title=LISTEN: Jack Buck Introduces First \"At Your Service\" Program On KMOX|publisher=CBS St. Louis|date=June 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBuck can be heard calling a (fictional) [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals season|1964 Cardinals]] broadcast in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/27/sports/sports-world-specials-the-ring-of-truth.html|title=Sports World Specials; The Ring of Truth|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG., Jr|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 27, 1989}}</ref> and makes a cameo appearance in a 1998 episode of the television series ''[[Arliss]]''. He also lent his voice to ''[[R.B.I. Baseball '95]]''.\n\n===Football===\nJack Buck was also a renowned [[American football|football]] broadcaster. In [[1964 NFL season|1964]], he began calling [[National Football League]] games for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] television, following a four-year stint doing telecasts of the rival [[American Football League]] for [[American Football League on ABC|ABC]], which included the 1962 AFL Championship game between the Houston Oilers and the Dallas Texans&mdash;at that point the longest game ever played. Buck called [[Chicago Bears]] games in his first two CBS seasons, then switched to [[Dallas Cowboys]] games, including the famous \"[[Ice Bowl (NFL)|Ice Bowl]]\" championship game in [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|1967]]. After the network moved away from dedicated team announcers, Buck continued to call regional NFL action through [[1974 NFL season|1974]], as well as several [[NFC Championship Game]]s and [[Super Bowl IV]]. He also called the [[1965 Cotton Bowl Classic]] for CBS television and several later Cotton Bowl games for CBS Radio.\n\nIn [[1975 NFL season|1975]], Buck temporarily left his [[1975 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] baseball duties in order to host the [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] pregame show, ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#GrandStand (1975\u20131976)|GrandStand]]'', alongside [[Bryant Gumbel]]. In the [[1976 NFL season|1976]] and [[1977 NFL season|1977]] seasons, he called regional NFL play-by-play for NBC. On August 16, 1976, Buck called the first-ever NFL game played outside of the United States, a preseason exhibition between the [[1976 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[1976 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] held at [[Korakuen Stadium]] in Tokyo, Japan. (Buck also worked NBC's backup ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' during the [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]] baseball season before returning to the Cardinals full-time in [[1977 St. Louis Cardinals season|1977]].)\n\nBuck served as the [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|CBS Radio]] voice of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (teaming with [[Hank Stram]]) for nearly two decades ([[1978 NFL season|1978]]\u2013[[1984 NFL season|1984]] and again from [[1987 NFL season|1987]]\u2013[[1995 NFL season|1995]] after CBS regained the radio rights from [[NFL on NBC Radio|NBC]]). Ironically, in 1970 ABC's [[Roone Arledge]] had asked via telephone about Buck's interests in becoming the first television play-by-play announcer for ''Monday Night Football'', but because of personal animosity surrounding his previous stint with the network, Buck would not return their phone call. (The television play-by-play role would go to [[Keith Jackson]] instead, and later to Buck's CBS colleague, [[Frank Gifford]].)\n\nIn addition to ''MNF'', Buck called numerous playoff games for CBS Radio, including 17 [[Super Bowl]]s (the most of any announcer). Buck also served as a local radio broadcaster for the football Cardinals in [[1980 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1980]] and [[1981 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1981]], and returned to calling Sunday NFL games for CBS television from [[1982 NFL season|1982]] to [[1987 NFL season|1987]].\n\nLate in the [[1990 NFL season]], Buck's onetime CBS broadcasting partner, [[Pat Summerall]], was hospitalized with a [[bleeding ulcer]] after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While [[Verne Lundquist]] replaced Summerall on games with lead analyst [[John Madden]], Buck (who was at the time the network's lead [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|Major League Baseball]] announcer) filled in for Lundquist, teaming with [[Dan Fouts]] to call two games (both of which coincidentally featured the Cardinals, who had moved from St. Louis to [[1990 Phoenix Cardinals season|Arizona]] by that time).\n\n===Other sports===\nWhile much better known for his baseball and football commentary, Jack Buck was also the original voice of the [[St. Louis Blues]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. Buck was paired with [[Jay Randolph]] and [[Gus Kyle]] on Blues broadcasts and covered the [[1968 Stanley Cup Finals|1968 Stanley Cup Final]] for KMOX radio.\n\nHe was succeeded after [[1967\u201368 St. Louis Blues season|one season]] by broadcaster [[Dan Kelly (sportscaster)|Dan Kelly]]. Buck also broadcast for the [[St. Louis Hawks]] and [[Rochester Royals]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], and called [[professional wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[bowling]] at various times in his career.\n\n===ABC and CBS baseball===\n[[File:JackBuck.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Jack Buck (left) with [[Ralph Kiner]] at the [[1987 in baseball|1987]] [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony.]]\nAs previously mentioned, in {{baseball year|1960}}, Buck along with [[Carl Erskine]] broadcast a series of late-afternoon Saturday games on [[Major League Baseball season|ABC]].<ref>{{cite news|date=April 12, 1960|title=ABC Signs Erskine as TV Color Man|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|page=C7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Can't Hide No-Hitter From Fans&mdash;Erskine|date=June 5, 1960|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Miami News|page=2C}}</ref> were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season.<ref>{{cite news|date=January 1, 1961|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Hartford Courant|title=No Major Changes Loom in TV Sports During 1961}}</ref>\n\nDespite temporarily losing the ''Game of the Week'' package in [[1961 in baseball|1961]], ABC still televised several games in [[prime time]] (with Buck returning to call the action).

Buck, along with CBS Radio colleagues Johnny Bench and [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]], was on hand at San Francisco's [[Candlestick Park]] on October 17, 1989, when the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] hit. After the 6.9 magnitude quake rocked the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], Buck told the listening audience:\n\n{{quote|I must say about Johnny Bench, folks, if he moved that fast when he played, he would have never hit into a double play. I never saw anybody move that fast in my life.}}\n\nHe is most famous for his coast-to-coast radio call of [[Kirk Gibson]]'s [[Kirk Gibson 1988 World Series home run|game-winning home run]] in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]] and his disbelief at Gibson knocking it out while hobbled by injuries to his right hamstring and left knee. His call of the play is so famous that it's sometimes played over the television footage of the play. The television call was handled by long-time Dodgers announcer [[Vin Scully]] on [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]].\n\nThis was Buck's call. It begins here with Buck speculating on what might happen if Gibson manages to reach base:\n\n{{quote|... then you would run for Gibson and have [[Steve Sax|Sax]] batting. But, we have a big 3&ndash;2 pitch coming here from [[Dennis Eckersley|Eckersley]]. Gibson ''swings'', and a fly ball to deep right field! ''This is gonna be a home run!'' Unbelievable! A home run for Gibson! And the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] have won the game, five to four; I don't believe what I just saw!}}\n\nThe last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with,\n\n{{quote|I don't ''believe'' what I just saw! Is this really happening, Bill?}}\n\nBuck concluded his comments on Gibson's amazing feat with this thought:\n\n{{quote|One of the most remarkable finishes to any World Series Game ... a one-handed home run by Kirk Gibson! And the Dodgers have won it ... five to four; and I'm stunned, Bill. I have seen a lot of dramatic finishes in a lot of sports, but this one might top almost every other one.}}\n\nBuck was not intended to be the main play-by-play announcer for [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|CBS]] baseball telecasts when the network acquired the sport from NBC and [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]. Originally assigned to the network's #2 crew (and therefore, work with [[Jim Kaat]]), he was promoted at practically the last minute after [[Brent Musburger]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Rusnak|first=Jeff|date=April 6, 1990|title=Buck In Brent At Cbs|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-04-06/sports/9001010646_1_ted-shaker-two-cbs-executives-brent-musburger|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|location= |access-date= }}</ref>  was fired on [[April Fools' Day]] of [[1990 in baseball|1990]].\n\nAfter two years of calling baseball telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'', [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], [[National League Championship Series]], and [[World Series]]), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst [[Tim McCarver]].<ref>[http://www.freeinfosociety.com/site.php?postnum=781 Buck never could come to terms with emphasis on analysts in televised sports.

After Vinton muffed the lyrics of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" in his home town of [[Pittsburgh]], Buck lightly referenced Vinton's [[Polish culture|Polish]] heritage (\"Well, when you're Polish & live in Pittsburgh, you can do anything you want with the words!\").<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-11/sports/sp-3218_1_national-anthem Vinton, Buck apologize for Wayward Words]</ref> Buck soon got death threats from [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirate]] fans, who even went as far as leaving a footprint on Buck's hotel pillow.\n\nThe next day, [[CBS Sports]] executive producer Ted Shaker spotted Buck in the hotel lobby and told Buck that he was in trouble. The final baseball play that Jack Buck narrated for CBS television was [[Gene Larkin]]'s game winning bloop single in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.\n\n{{quote|The [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]] are going to win the World Series!

Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], requiring a [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]], [[cataract]]s, [[sciatica]], and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Buck once joked, ''\"I wish I'd get [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], then I could forget I've got all the other stuff.\"'' In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called [[J. Buck's]], with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie.<ref>{{cite news|title=J.

He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for [[lung cancer]], [[Deep brain stimulation|Parkinson's disease]], and to correct an [[intestine|intestinal]] blockage.\n\nWithin two hours of his death, fans were leaving flowers at the base of his bust outside [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] even though it was the middle of the night. The flags at St. Louis City Hall and the St. Louis County Government Center were lowered to half-staff, the local television news anchors all wore black suits for the next several days, and a public visitation was held in the stadium before the next baseball game after his death, with free admission to the game for all the mourners who filed past his coffin.\n\nBuck was interred at [[Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery]] in south St. Louis County. His spot on the KMOX Cardinals broadcasts was subsequently filled by former [[Colorado Rockies]] announcer Wayne Hagin. Hagin, who went on to the [[New York Mets]] after his stint in St. Louis, moved over to television, and his spot was filled by one of Buck's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, former [[Chicago White Sox]] announcer [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]].\n\nBuck's youngest son, [[Joe Buck|Joe]], read the eulogy at his father's church funeral.

Joe Buck has also done occasional local telecasts for the Cardinals as well as commercials for a local automobile dealership. He has also stated that his father was his best friend and his inspiration. \nJack and Joe Buck are also the only father and son to call play-by-play of Super Bowl telecasts.

His early sportscasting career included work for the minor league affiliates of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. In 1954, he was promoted to radio play-by-play of Cardinal games on [[KMOX]], a position that he maintained for nearly all of the next 47 years. He was known in St. Louis for his trademark phrase \"That's a winner!\", which was said after every game that the Cardinals had won.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Cardinals, Buck also earned assignments on many national sportscasts, including radio coverage of 18 [[Super Bowl]]s and 11 [[World Series]]. Some of his famous play-by-play calls include the dramatic walk-off home runs hit by [[Ozzie Smith]] in Game 5 of the [[1985 National League Championship Series]], by [[Kirk Gibson]] in Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]], and by [[Kirby Puckett]] in Game 6 of the [[1991 World Series]].\n\nThe later part of his career found him working side-by-side in the Cardinals booth with his son [[Joe Buck]], who also has risen to national sportscasting prominence.\n\n==Military service==\nAfter graduating from high school, he worked on large shipping boats that traveled the [[Great Lakes]].

He worked several jobs while attending college, including one position at an all-night gas station. He&nbsp;crafted his play-by-play skills broadcasting [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State basketball]] games.\n\nAfter college, he called games for the [[Columbus Red Birds]], a [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] ([[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]) affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, in [[1950 in baseball|1950]]\u2013[[1951 in baseball|51]]. He spent the [[1953 in baseball|1953]] season as voice of another AAA Cardinals affiliate, the [[International League]] [[Rochester Red Wings]] on WHEC (AM). His work there earned him an invitation to join the big-league Cardinals' broadcast team in St. Louis the following season.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n\n===St. Louis Cardinals===\n{{MLBBioHon\n|Image = CardsRetiredMic.png\n|Name  = Jack Buck\n|Team  = St. Louis Cardinals\n|Year  = 2002\n|}}\nBuck started broadcasting Cardinals games for [[KMOX (AM)|KMOX]] radio in [[1954 St. Louis Cardinals season|1954]], teaming with [[Harry Caray]], [[Milo Hamilton]] (1954), and [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] (from [[1955 St. Louis Cardinals season|1955]]). Buck was dropped from the Cardinals booth in [[1959 St. Louis Cardinals season|1959]] to make room for [[Buddy Blattner]]; the following [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals season|year]], he called Saturday ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' telecasts for [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]. Buck was re-hired by the Cardinals in [[1961 St. Louis Cardinals season|1961]] after Blattner departed; Garagiola left the following year, leaving Caray and Buck as the team's broadcast voices through [[1969 St. Louis Cardinals season|1969]].\n[[File:Kmox radio baseball.jpg|thumb|right|Buck and Shannon announcing a [[1992 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] game at Busch, 1992]]\nAfter Caray was fired by the Cardinals following the 1969 season, Buck ascended to the team's lead play-by-play role (1969 was also the year that Jack Buck divorced his first wife Alyce Larson&mdash;whom he had married in 1948 and had six children with&mdash;and married his second wife, Carole Lintzenich, who gave birth to their son [[Joe Buck]] in the same year).\n\n{{quote box\n|width=30%\n|align=right\n|quote=[[Ozzie Smith|Smith]] corks one into right, down the line!

In [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals season|1972]], retired Cardinals third baseman [[Mike Shannon]] joined Buck in the broadcast booth, beginning a 28-year partnership. On Cardinals broadcasts, Buck routinely punctuated St. Louis victories with the expression, ''\"That's a winner!\"''\n\nIn addition to Joe, Buck has three daughters who worked in broadcasting. Two are from his first marriage - Bonnie Buck, who currently works in television in Los Angeles, and Christine Buck, who started her career at [[KPLR-TV]] in St. Louis. From his second marriage is Julie Buck on [[KYKY]] 98.1 in St. Louis (she now works at [KTRS-AM 550], also in St. Louis). In addition, Buck's late younger brother, [[Bob Buck]] was a sportscaster and sports director at KMOX/[[KMOV]]-TV in St. Louis.\n\nBuck was well respected in the St. Louis community, where he lived and regularly volunteered time to host charity events. In addition to his sportscasting work, Buck served as the original host of the KMOX interview/call-in program ''At Your Service'' beginning in 1960. His guests on the program included [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/06/13/jack-buck-introduces-first-at-your-service-program-on-kmox/|title=LISTEN: Jack Buck Introduces First \"At Your Service\" Program On KMOX|publisher=CBS St. Louis|date=June 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBuck can be heard calling a (fictional) [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals season|1964 Cardinals]] broadcast in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/27/sports/sports-world-specials-the-ring-of-truth.html|title=Sports World Specials; The Ring of Truth|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG., Jr|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 27, 1989}}</ref> and makes a cameo appearance in a 1998 episode of the television series ''[[Arliss]]''. He also lent his voice to ''[[R.B.I. Baseball '95]]''.\n\n===Football===\nJack Buck was also a renowned [[American football|football]] broadcaster. In [[1964 NFL season|1964]], he began calling [[National Football League]] games for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] television, following a four-year stint doing telecasts of the rival [[American Football League]] for [[American Football League on ABC|ABC]], which included the 1962 AFL Championship game between the Houston Oilers and the Dallas Texans&mdash;at that point the longest game ever played. Buck called [[Chicago Bears]] games in his first two CBS seasons, then switched to [[Dallas Cowboys]] games, including the famous \"[[Ice Bowl (NFL)|Ice Bowl]]\" championship game in [[1967 Dallas Cowboys season|1967]]. After the network moved away from dedicated team announcers, Buck continued to call regional NFL action through [[1974 NFL season|1974]], as well as several [[NFC Championship Game]]s and [[Super Bowl IV]]. He also called the [[1965 Cotton Bowl Classic]] for CBS television and several later Cotton Bowl games for CBS Radio.\n\nIn [[1975 NFL season|1975]], Buck temporarily left his [[1975 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] baseball duties in order to host the [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] pregame show, ''[[The NFL on NBC Pregame Show#GrandStand (1975\u20131976)|GrandStand]]'', alongside [[Bryant Gumbel]]. In the [[1976 NFL season|1976]] and [[1977 NFL season|1977]] seasons, he called regional NFL play-by-play for NBC. On August 16, 1976, Buck called the first-ever NFL game played outside of the United States, a preseason exhibition between the [[1976 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[1976 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] held at [[Korakuen Stadium]] in Tokyo, Japan. (Buck also worked NBC's backup ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'' during the [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976]] baseball season before returning to the Cardinals full-time in [[1977 St. Louis Cardinals season|1977]].)\n\nBuck served as the [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|CBS Radio]] voice of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (teaming with [[Hank Stram]]) for nearly two decades ([[1978 NFL season|1978]]\u2013[[1984 NFL season|1984]] and again from [[1987 NFL season|1987]]\u2013[[1995 NFL season|1995]] after CBS regained the radio rights from [[NFL on NBC Radio|NBC]]). Ironically, in 1970 ABC's [[Roone Arledge]] had asked via telephone about Buck's interests in becoming the first television play-by-play announcer for ''Monday Night Football'', but because of personal animosity surrounding his previous stint with the network, Buck would not return their phone call. (The television play-by-play role would go to [[Keith Jackson]] instead, and later to Buck's CBS colleague, [[Frank Gifford]].)\n\nIn addition to ''MNF'', Buck called numerous playoff games for CBS Radio, including 17 [[Super Bowl]]s (the most of any announcer). Buck also served as a local radio broadcaster for the football Cardinals in [[1980 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1980]] and [[1981 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1981]], and returned to calling Sunday NFL games for CBS television from [[1982 NFL season|1982]] to [[1987 NFL season|1987]].\n\nLate in the [[1990 NFL season]], Buck's onetime CBS broadcasting partner, [[Pat Summerall]], was hospitalized with a [[bleeding ulcer]] after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While [[Verne Lundquist]] replaced Summerall on games with lead analyst [[John Madden]], Buck (who was at the time the network's lead [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|Major League Baseball]] announcer) filled in for Lundquist, teaming with [[Dan Fouts]] to call two games (both of which coincidentally featured the Cardinals, who had moved from St. Louis to [[1990 Phoenix Cardinals season|Arizona]] by that time).\n\n===Other sports===\nWhile much better known for his baseball and football commentary, Jack Buck was also the original voice of the [[St. Louis Blues]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. Buck was paired with [[Jay Randolph]] and [[Gus Kyle]] on Blues broadcasts and covered the [[1968 Stanley Cup Finals|1968 Stanley Cup Final]] for KMOX radio.\n\nHe was succeeded after [[1967\u201368 St. Louis Blues season|one season]] by broadcaster [[Dan Kelly (sportscaster)|Dan Kelly]].

Buck, along with CBS Radio colleagues Johnny Bench and [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]], was on hand at San Francisco's [[Candlestick Park]] on October 17, 1989, when the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] hit. After the 6.9 magnitude quake rocked the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], Buck told the listening audience:\n\n{{quote|I must say about Johnny Bench, folks, if he moved that fast when he played, he would have never hit into a double play. I never saw anybody move that fast in my life.}}\n\nHe is most famous for his coast-to-coast radio call of [[Kirk Gibson]]'s [[Kirk Gibson 1988 World Series home run|game-winning home run]] in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 1 of the [[1988 World Series]] and his disbelief at Gibson knocking it out while hobbled by injuries to his right hamstring and left knee. His call of the play is so famous that it's sometimes played over the television footage of the play. The television call was handled by long-time Dodgers announcer [[Vin Scully]] on [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]].\n\nThis was Buck's call. It begins here with Buck speculating on what might happen if Gibson manages to reach base:\n\n{{quote|... then you would run for Gibson and have [[Steve Sax|Sax]] batting. But, we have a big 3&ndash;2 pitch coming here from [[Dennis Eckersley|Eckersley]]. Gibson ''swings'', and a fly ball to deep right field! ''This is gonna be a home run!'' Unbelievable! A home run for Gibson! And the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] have won the game, five to four; I don't believe what I just saw!}}\n\nThe last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with,\n\n{{quote|I don't ''believe'' what I just saw! Is this really happening, Bill?}}\n\nBuck concluded his comments on Gibson's amazing feat with this thought:\n\n{{quote|One of the most remarkable finishes to any World Series Game ... a one-handed home run by Kirk Gibson! And the Dodgers have won it ... five to four; and I'm stunned, Bill. I have seen a lot of dramatic finishes in a lot of sports, but this one might top almost every other one.}}\n\nBuck was not intended to be the main play-by-play announcer for [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|CBS]] baseball telecasts when the network acquired the sport from NBC and [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]. Originally assigned to the network's #2 crew (and therefore, work with [[Jim Kaat]]), he was promoted at practically the last minute after [[Brent Musburger]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Rusnak|first=Jeff|date=April 6, 1990|title=Buck In Brent At Cbs|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-04-06/sports/9001010646_1_ted-shaker-two-cbs-executives-brent-musburger|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|location= |access-date= }}</ref>  was fired on [[April Fools' Day]] of [[1990 in baseball|1990]].\n\nAfter two years of calling baseball telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]'', [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], [[National League Championship Series]], and [[World Series]]), Buck was dismissed by CBS.

After Vinton muffed the lyrics of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" in his home town of [[Pittsburgh]], Buck lightly referenced Vinton's [[Polish culture|Polish]] heritage (\"Well, when you're Polish & live in Pittsburgh, you can do anything you want with the words!\").<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-11/sports/sp-3218_1_national-anthem Vinton, Buck apologize for Wayward Words]</ref> Buck soon got death threats from [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirate]] fans, who even went as far as leaving a footprint on Buck's hotel pillow.\n\nThe next day, [[CBS Sports]] executive producer Ted Shaker spotted Buck in the hotel lobby and told Buck that he was in trouble. The final baseball play that Jack Buck narrated for CBS television was [[Gene Larkin]]'s game winning bloop single in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.\n\n{{quote|The [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]] are going to win the World Series!

Health concerns obviously could have played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], requiring a [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]], [[cataract]]s, [[sciatica]], and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Buck once joked, ''\"I wish I'd get [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], then I could forget I've got all the other stuff.\"'' In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called [[J. Buck's]], with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie.<ref>{{cite news|title=J.

He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for [[lung cancer]], [[Deep brain stimulation|Parkinson's disease]], and to correct an [[intestine|intestinal]] blockage.\n\nWithin two hours of his death, fans were leaving flowers at the base of his bust outside [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]] even though it was the middle of the night. The flags at St. Louis City Hall and the St. Louis County Government Center were lowered to half-staff, the local television news anchors all wore black suits for the next several days, and a public visitation was held in the stadium before the next baseball game after his death, with free admission to the game for all the mourners who filed past his coffin.\n\nBuck was interred at [[Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery]] in south St. Louis County. His spot on the KMOX Cardinals broadcasts was subsequently filled by former [[Colorado Rockies]] announcer Wayne Hagin. Hagin, who went on to the [[New York Mets]] after his stint in St. Louis, moved over to television, and his spot was filled by one of Buck's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, former [[Chicago White Sox]] announcer [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]].\n\nBuck's youngest son, [[Joe Buck|Joe]], read the eulogy at his father's church funeral.

He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.\n\nThe cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|last = Inglis |first = Fred|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010 | isbn = 9780691135625}}</ref> whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}</ref> and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.\n\nThe [[Film industry|movie industry]] spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and now, the familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity was not always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', \"in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}</ref>  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of [[movie star]]s and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.\n\nThe second half of the century saw [[television]] and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: \"We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,\"<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |newspaper = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a Beatle live}}</ref> which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and newsreaders. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into wider stardom.\n\nIn the '60s and early '70s, the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases, the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord}}</ref>\n\n==Becoming a celebrity==\n[[File:The Chief Guest and renowned actor Shahrukh Khan addressing at the inauguration of the 38th International Film Festival of India (IFFI-2007) at Panaji, Goa on November 23, 2007.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Shah Rukh Khan]] is an Indian actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, host and much more. ]]\nPeople may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. The term \"instant celebrity\" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a \"B-grade celebrity\". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.\n\n===Success===\nThere are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.\n\nThough glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.<ref>{{cite web |author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102034806/http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Boxall |first=Natalie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&A: Career options in the music industry &#124; Guardian careers &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219081012/http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOutside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, [[invention]], [[medicine]], and courtroom law which is not fictional.

Most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as a result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to the general public does not the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor. This means they can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a more significant amount of market share than the average entrepreneur.<ref name=\"7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures\">{{cite news|title=7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures |url=http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |publisher=Growthink |year=2007 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702110650/http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |archivedate=July 2, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==As a mass media phenomenon==\n[[File:Kim Kardashian 2017 (cropped).png|thumb|[[Kim Kardashian]], reality TV star]]\n\nCelebrities often have fame comparable to [[royal family|royalty]].

Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal about their political views. For example, [[Matt Damon]] expressed his displeasure with 2008 US vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]], as well as with the 2011 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,420621,00.html |title=Matt Damon: Sarah Palin Presidency Would Be Like a 'Really Bad Disney Movie' |publisher=Fox News |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Young |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8617149.stm |title=Election 2010: Political celebrities \u2013 then and now |work=BBC News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Famous for being famous==\n{{Main|Famous for being famous}}\n[[File:Paris Hilton 2009.jpg|thumb|American [[socialite]] [[Paris Hilton]] was one of the first celebrities to be described as '[[#Famous for being famous|famous for being famous]]', she has since expanded her brand into a  multibillion-dollar empire]]\nFamous for being famous, in [[popular culture]] terminology, refers to someone who attains celebrity status for no particular identifiable reason, or who achieves fame through association with a celebrity.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Joe|title=Contemporary moral issues|publisher=Heinemann|year=2002|edition=4, illustrated|series=Examining Religions|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarymora0000jenk/page/178 178]|isbn=978-0-435-30309-9|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarymora0000jenk/page/178}}</ref>  The term is a [[pejorative]], suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities.<ref name=\"JenJones\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jen|title=Being Famous|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2007|series=Snap Books: 10 Things You Need to Know about|page=[https://archive.org/details/beingfamous0000jone/page/20 20]|isbn=978-1-4296-0126-9|url=https://archive.org/details/beingfamous0000jone/page/20}}</ref> Even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe coinages \"[[famesque]]\" and \"[[celebutante]]\" are of similar pejorative gist.\n\n==Internet celebrities==\nAlso known as being ''[[Internet celebrity|internet famous]]'', contemporary fame does not always involve a physical red carpet.\n\n===Online fame in Asia===\nA report by [[BBC]] highlighted a longtime trend of Asian internet celebrities such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] celebrity [[Wang Hong]] (birth name Ling Ling).<ref name=\"Chinese Internet Fame\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/36802769 \"Wang Hong: China's online stars making real cash\"] ''[[BBC News]]''.

Not everything is as concealed as it was back in old Hollywood because now everything is put out on the internet by fans or even the celebrity themselves. Websites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube allow people to become a celebrity overnight. For example, [[Justin Bieber]] got his start on YouTube by posting videos of him singing and got discovered. All of his fans got direct contact with his content and were able to interact with him on several social media platforms. Social media has substantially changed what it means to be a celebrity. Instagram and YouTube allow regular people to become rich and famous all from inside their home. It also allows fans to connect with their favorite celebrity without ever meeting them in person. Everything is being shared on social media so it makes it harder for celebrities to live private lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/celebrity-social-media-anger/|title=How social media has changed what it means to be a celebrity|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\nSocial media sites have also contributed to the fame of some celebrities, such as [[Tila Tequila]] who became known through MySpace.<ref>Trebay, Guy [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28fame.html \"She's Famous (and So Can You)\"], The New York Times, October 28, 2007, </ref>\n\n==Families==\n[[File:The British royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.JPG|thumb|right|Members of the House of Windsor on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 15 June 2013.]]\nAnother example of a celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. In some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; The [[Hilton family|Hilton]] and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families with business; the [[Jackson family]] with popular music; and the [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian]], [[Baldwin family|Baldwin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with television and film.\n\n==Restricted access==\nAccess to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews.  Writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] said, \"You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.\"<ref>[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]</ref>\n\nCelebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or [[autograph]]-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]).

He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.\n\nThe cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|last = Inglis |first = Fred|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010 | isbn = 9780691135625}}</ref> whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}</ref> and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.\n\nThe [[Film industry|movie industry]] spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and now, the familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity was not always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting as a medium.

[[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: \"We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,\"<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |newspaper = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a Beatle live}}</ref> which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and newsreaders. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into wider stardom.\n\nIn the '60s and early '70s, the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases, the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord}}</ref>\n\n==Becoming a celebrity==\n[[File:The Chief Guest and renowned actor Shahrukh Khan addressing at the inauguration of the 38th International Film Festival of India (IFFI-2007) at Panaji, Goa on November 23, 2007.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Shah Rukh Khan]] is an Indian actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, host and much more. ]]\nPeople may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. The term \"instant celebrity\" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a \"B-grade celebrity\". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.\n\n===Success===\nThere are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity.

This means they can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a more significant amount of market share than the average entrepreneur.<ref name=\"7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures\">{{cite news|title=7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures |url=http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |publisher=Growthink |year=2007 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702110650/http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |archivedate=July 2, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n==As a mass media phenomenon==\n[[File:Kim Kardashian 2017 (cropped).png|thumb|[[Kim Kardashian]], reality TV star]]\n\nCelebrities often have fame comparable to [[royal family|royalty]]. As a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. The release of [[Kim Kardashian]]'s [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with rapper [[Ray J]] in 2003 brought her to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals, and [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|reality TV]] series.<ref>{{cite journal | title=\"Kim Kardashian Superstar Featuring Ray J\" 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | last=Hirsch | first=S | journal=Vivid Entertainment LLC. \u2013 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | year=2007}}</ref><ref name=vivid>{{cite web|url= http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|title= Vivid Entertainment Spends $1-Million To Acquire Notorious Video 'Starring' Sexy Socialite Kim Kardashian And Hip Hop Star Ray J|accessdate= 2008-10-06|author= [[Vivid Entertainment]]|date= 2007-02-07|publisher= Hip Hop Press|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923231924/http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|archivedate= September 23, 2008|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCelebrities may be resented for their accolades, and the public may have a love/hate relationship with celebrities. Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal about their political views. For example, [[Matt Damon]] expressed his displeasure with 2008 US vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]], as well as with the 2011 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,420621,00.html |title=Matt Damon: Sarah Palin Presidency Would Be Like a 'Really Bad Disney Movie' |publisher=Fox News |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Young |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8617149.stm |title=Election 2010: Political celebrities \u2013 then and now |work=BBC News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Famous for being famous==\n{{Main|Famous for being famous}}\n[[File:Paris Hilton 2009.jpg|thumb|American [[socialite]] [[Paris Hilton]] was one of the first celebrities to be described as '[[#Famous for being famous|famous for being famous]]', she has since expanded her brand into a  multibillion-dollar empire]]\nFamous for being famous, in [[popular culture]] terminology, refers to someone who attains celebrity status for no particular identifiable reason, or who achieves fame through association with a celebrity.<ref name=\"Jenkins\">{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Joe|title=Contemporary moral issues|publisher=Heinemann|year=2002|edition=4, illustrated|series=Examining Religions|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporarymora0000jenk/page/178 178]|isbn=978-0-435-30309-9|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporarymora0000jenk/page/178}}</ref>  The term is a [[pejorative]], suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities.<ref name=\"JenJones\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jen|title=Being Famous|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2007|series=Snap Books: 10 Things You Need to Know about|page=[https://archive.org/details/beingfamous0000jone/page/20 20]|isbn=978-1-4296-0126-9|url=https://archive.org/details/beingfamous0000jone/page/20}}</ref> Even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe coinages \"[[famesque]]\" and \"[[celebutante]]\" are of similar pejorative gist.\n\n==Internet celebrities==\nAlso known as being ''[[Internet celebrity|internet famous]]'', contemporary fame does not always involve a physical red carpet.\n\n===Online fame in Asia===\nA report by [[BBC]] highlighted a longtime trend of Asian internet celebrities such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] celebrity [[Wang Hong]] (birth name Ling Ling).<ref name=\"Chinese Internet Fame\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/36802769 \"Wang Hong: China's online stars making real cash\"] ''[[BBC News]]''.

Social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as ''[[Us Weekly]]'' and ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]''. Celebrity blogging have also spawned stars such as [[Perez Hilton]] who is well known for not only blogging but also [[outing]] celebrities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Anne|date=Spring 2007|title=Celebrity juice, not from concentrate: Perez Hilton, gossip blogs, and the new star production|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc49.2007/PerezHilton/index.html|journal=Jump Cut|volume=49|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nSocial media and the rise of the smartphone have changed how celebrities are treated and how people gain the platform of fame. Not everything is as concealed as it was back in old Hollywood because now everything is put out on the internet by fans or even the celebrity themselves. Websites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube allow people to become a celebrity overnight. For example, [[Justin Bieber]] got his start on YouTube by posting videos of him singing and got discovered. All of his fans got direct contact with his content and were able to interact with him on several social media platforms. Social media has substantially changed what it means to be a celebrity. Instagram and YouTube allow regular people to become rich and famous all from inside their home. It also allows fans to connect with their favorite celebrity without ever meeting them in person. Everything is being shared on social media so it makes it harder for celebrities to live private lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/celebrity-social-media-anger/|title=How social media has changed what it means to be a celebrity|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\nSocial media sites have also contributed to the fame of some celebrities, such as [[Tila Tequila]] who became known through MySpace.<ref>Trebay, Guy [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28fame.html \"She's Famous (and So Can You)\"], The New York Times, October 28, 2007, </ref>\n\n==Families==\n[[File:The British royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.JPG|thumb|right|Members of the House of Windsor on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 15 June 2013.]]\nAnother example of a celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. In some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; The [[Hilton family|Hilton]] and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families with business; the [[Jackson family]] with popular music; and the [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian]], [[Baldwin family|Baldwin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with television and film.\n\n==Restricted access==\nAccess to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews.  Writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] said, \"You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.\"<ref>[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]</ref>\n\nCelebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or [[autograph]]-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]). The bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands.\n\nCelebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iacpo.org/ |title=International Association of Close Protection Officers |access-date=September 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115032219/http://www.iacpo.org/ |archive-date=January 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name = \"Celebrity-stalking has common threads \">{{cite news |title= Celebrity-stalking has common threads|url= http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=6730960= |publisher= ABC|date= March 26, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==15 minutes of fame==\n{{see also|15 minutes of fame|One-hit wonder}}\n\n[[Andy Warhol]] famously coined the phrase \"[[15 minutes of fame]]\" in reference to short-lived publicity.
