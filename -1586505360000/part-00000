During his 1994 MVP campaign, he set a new NFL record for passer rating at 112.8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/niHv9|title=Passer rating seasons, 110+, 150 att|work=Pro-Football-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}</ref> He is a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nYoung was an efficient passer \u2013 leading the league in [[passer rating]] a record six times, and completion percentage and yards per attempt five times.<ref name=pfrleader>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/Y/YounSt00.htm#all_leaderboard|title=Steve Young Stats: Leaderboards|work=Pro-Football-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}</ref> At the time of his retirement, he had the highest passer rating among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts (96.8).

He earned 1978 All-[[Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference|FCIAC]] West Division First Team honors in his junior year, his first year as a starter. In his senior year he rushed for 13 touchdowns and earned All-FCIAC West Division First Team honors, and was named to the [[Connecticut Association of Schools|CIAC]] All-State team. In the rush-first option offense run by Greenwich he completed only 41 percent of his throws for 1,220 yards, but ran the ball 267 times for 1,928 yards. On Thanksgiving Day in November 1979, Greenwich lost to Darien High School, known for its \"Tidal Wave Defense\", 17\u20130.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/23/archives/darien-defense-stops-greenwich-170-connecticut.html | title=Darien Defense Stops Greenwich, 17\u20130 | date=November 23, 1979 | work=The New York Times | accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref> During his senior year, he was co-captain of the football, basketball and baseball teams. In basketball, he averaged 15 points a game. In baseball, he hit .384 and played center field when he wasn't pitching. He was 5\u20131 and threw a 3\u20130 [[no-hitter]] against [[New Canaan High School]].\n\n==College football==\nYoung was heavily recruited by the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|University of North Carolina]]. Coach [[Dick Crum (American football)|Dick Crum]] was enamored by Young's running ability, and wanted him to run his option offense. Young instead chose BYU. Initially, he struggled at throwing the ball, and BYU's coaching staff considered switching him to defensive back because of his athleticism. However, he worked hard to improve his passing skills and eventually succeeded record-setting [[Jim McMahon]] as BYU's starting QB. Young's senior season (1983) was spectacular. He passed for 3,902 yards and 33 touchdowns in the regular season, and his 71.3% completion percentage set an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] single-season record. He also added 544 yards rushing. With Young at quarterback, BYU set an NCAA record by averaging 584.2 yards of total offense per game, with 370.5 of those yards coming from Young's passing and rushing. The Cougars finished the year with an impressive 11&ndash;1 record; Young was named First Team [[All-America]]n by several news organizations and received the [[Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award]], which recognizes the nation's best collegiate quarterback each year. He also finished second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]], behind [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] running back [[Mike Rozier]]. Young capped his college career by scoring the game-winning touchdown on a pass from the halfback in BYU's 21&ndash;17 victory over [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] in the [[1983 Holiday Bowl]].\n\nYoung finished his college career with 592 pass completions for 7,733 yards and 56 touchdowns, along with 1,048 yards and 18 touchdowns rushing. He was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2001.\n\n==Professional football==\n\n===USFL===\n====Los Angeles Express====\nYoung was selected by the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] in the first round (11th overall) of the [[1984 USFL Draft]]. He signed a record ten-year, $40 million contract with the [[United States Football League|USFL]]'s [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] in {{nowrap|March 1984.<ref name=esyffm>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wldWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8O4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6550%2C2839659 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |last=Peters |first=Ken |title=Express sign Young for $40 million |date=March 2, 1984 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=ywbospe>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5vdVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jOEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3664%2C1401376 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=sire services |title=Young will be old when pact ends |date=March 6, 1984 |page=E1}}</ref><ref name=yswexp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=48UoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8YIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6277%2C2052307 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |agency=(AP, ''Los Angeles Times, Washington Post'') |title=Young signs with Express |date=March 5, 1984 |page=D1}}</ref><ref name=expmp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DfcoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EYcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4100%2C5565224 |work=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=UPI |title=Express paid 'market price' for QB |date=March 6, 1984 |page=D3}}</ref>}} He agreed to take his payment in the form of an [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] paid out over forty years to help the fledgling team. \n\nIt was taken for granted that Young would be the first pick in the [[1984 NFL Draft]], and that he would be selected by the then-moribund [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. Express general manager [[Don Klosterman (American football)|Don Klosterman]] told Young that if he signed with the Express, his head coach would be [[John Hadl]], a former All-Pro quarterback who had shepherded [[John Elway]] through his first year in the NFL. Klosterman also told Young that Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gilman]], who had been hired as a consultant, would tutor him on how to be a pro quarterback. Young was convinced, and signed with the Express.<ref name=Reeths/>\n\nAt the time, it was another huge signing by the fledgling league, which had already succeeded in signing both the reigning [[Heisman Trophy]] winner, running back [[Mike Rozier]] of Nebraska; and the previous winner, [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] running back [[Herschel Walker]]. After missing the first six games of his rookie season while taking some college classes in order to graduate on time, Young started the final twelve. He had a respectable year, highlighted by becoming the first pro football player ever to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 in a single game. Despite being surrounded with talent which included such future NFL players as [[Jojo Townsell]], [[Mel Gray (return specialist)|Mel Gray]], and [[Kevin Nelson (American football)|Kevin Nelson]], and making the playoffs in Young's first season, the Express was never able to create a sustaining fan base in [[Los Angeles]]. \n\nLate in the season, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an investigation of owner J. William Oldenburg's finances that suggested Oldenburg was not as well off as he claimed.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/03/business/the-unraveling-of-a-billionaire.html | title=The Unraveling of a 'Billionaire' | first=C.

Before one game, the team bus driver refused to drive the Express to their final home game \u2013 which had been moved to [[Los Angeles Pierce College]] in the San Fernando Valley \u2013 unless he was paid up front in cash. Young contributed some money, as did the team trainer, and the driver took them to the game. In the season finale at [[Orlando Renegades|Orlando]], Young had to line up at tailback because a rash of injuries had left the Express without any healthy running backs. The owners had refused to allocate any money to allow the Express to replace injured players.<ref name=Reeths/><ref name=Buck/>\n\nIt was reported that Young had insured the contract and would still be paid until 2027.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1825502-steve-young-will-make-1-million-in-2014-from-usfl-deal-signed-in-1984 | title=Steve Young Will Make $1 Million in 2014 from USFL Deal Signed in 1984 | first=Tim | last=Keeney | date=October 25, 2013 | website=[[Bleacher Report]]}}</ref> However, a 1985 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article stated that he received a $1.4 million settlement on the annuity.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-08-10-sp-3859-story.html | title=USFL Confirms Young Is Highest-Paid Player at $2.4 Million a Year | first=Bob | last=Oates | date=August 10, 1985 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe league ceased operations in 1986 after losing most of its claims in an [[United States Football League#USFL v. NFL lawsuit|antitrust suit against the NFL]], with its top talent absorbed by the NFL in a dispersal draft conducted in the aftermath.\n\n===NFL===\n====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====\nYoung grew increasingly dissatisfied with the disarray surrounding the Express. Just a week before what proved to be the last USFL title game, Young gave the USFL an ultimatum \u2013 find a new owner for the Express, or allow him to buy out his contract and go to the NFL.<ref name=Buck/> Soon after the league decided to suspend the Express's operations for the 1986 season, Young bought out his Express contract and signed with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who had made him the first pick in a [[1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players|supplemental draft of USFL and CFL players]] a year earlier. \n\nBy this time, the Bucs were in the midst of what would be 12 consecutive 10-loss seasons. They posted identical 2&ndash;14 records in Young's two seasons with them, going 3&ndash;16 with him as a starter. Young threw for only 11 touchdowns with 21 interceptions while completing fewer than 55% of his passes.\n\n====San Francisco 49ers====\nThe Buccaneers selected [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] first overall in the [[1987 NFL Draft]] because Young was deemed a bust. Young was traded to the San Francisco 49ers on April 24, 1987 to serve as a backup to [[Joe Montana]]. 49ers coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] was impressed by Young's natural abilities, and believed his lackluster numbers were primarily due to the lack of talent around him in Tampa Bay. \n\nThe Buccaneers received second and fourth round draft picks in the trade, which they used to draft Miami [[linebacker]] [[Winston Moss]], and [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]] [[wide receiver]] [[Bruce Hill (American football)|Bruce Hill]], respectively.\n\n====Montana's backup: 1987\u20131990====\nYoung played behind Montana for four years, but shone as a backup. Substituting for an injured Montana, early in the first quarter of a [[1987 San Francisco 49ers season|1987]] game against the [[1987 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], he threw four touchdown passes in a 41\u20130 victory. In their 1987 divisional playoff game against the [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], he replaced Montana in the second half after the team fell behind 27\u201310. The 49ers still lost the game, but Young had a good performance, completing 12 of 17 pass attempts for 158 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading San Francisco in rushing with 72 yards and a touchdown on six carries. On October 30, 1988, Young ran for a 49-yard, game-winning touchdown against the [[1988 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]]. He started the game out with a 73-yard touchdown pass to [[John Taylor (American football player)|John Taylor]], after Montana went down with an injury. The play earned the 49ers a 24\u201321 victory and a bit of revenge on the Vikings for their previous season's playoff loss.  The win turned out to be crucial, as without it the 49ers would have finished the season 9\u20137 and missed the playoffs, as two other teams in their division, the [[1988 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] and [[1988 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], had 10\u20136 records.  Instead, the 49ers won their division, earned the #2 playoff seed, and went on to win the [[Super Bowl XXIII|Super Bowl]].\n\nIn 1989, he displayed potential to become the team's starter in the future. While Montana won the NFL MVP award and led the team to victory in [[Super Bowl XXIV]], Young still had a good season, completing 69% of his passes for 1,001 yards and eight touchdowns, with only three interceptions. On October 22, 1989, he posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3 when he completed 11 of 12 passes for 188 yards and three touchdown passes in a 37\u201320 victory over the [[1989 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]].\n\nHe rushed for a career-high 102 yards on just eight carries against the [[1990 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] on December 23, 1990, making him only the second 49ers quarterback to rush for at least 100 yards in a single game. The 49ers lost the game 13\u201310.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199012230sfo.htm | title=New Orleans Saints at San Francisco 49ers \u2013 December 23rd, 1990 | website=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn his four seasons as a backup, Young threw 23 touchdown passes and only six interceptions.\n\n====1991 season====\nFollowing an injury to Montana's elbow in the [[NFL playoffs, 1990-91#NFC Championship: New York Giants 15.2C San Francisco 49ers 13|1990 NFC Championship Game]], which forced him to miss the entire 1991 season, Young got his chance to lead the 49ers. He got off to a rough start. Midway through the season, the 49ers found themselves struggling with a 4&ndash;4 record. In the ninth game of the season, after throwing a franchise-record 97-yard touchdown pass to Taylor, Young suffered a knee injury and was replaced by backup quarterback [[Steve Bono]]. After a loss in that game and the next, Bono led the 49ers to five consecutive victories, playing so well that coach [[George Seifert]] decided to keep him in the starting lineup after Young had recovered. It wasn't until late in the 15th game of the season, after Bono went down with an injury of his own, that Young got to play again. Young then closed out the season by throwing for 338 yards and three touchdowns and also rushing for 63 yards and another touchdown in a 52&ndash;14 win over the [[Chicago Bears]] in a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game at [[Candlestick Park]].\n\nYoung finished the season with an NFL best 101.8 passer rating. Despite missing five full games and most of a sixth, he still threw for 2,517 yards and 17 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions. But despite Young's strong season, the season for the team was widely regarded as a disappointment. The 49ers had slipped from a 14&ndash;2 record in the previous season to a 10&ndash;6 record in 1991. While 10 wins is usually enough to make the playoffs, this time it was not, and San Francisco ended up not playing in the postseason for the first time since 1982. It was thought by many that Young's days as the 49ers starter were numbered due to the impending return of Montana from the injury to his right elbow, and some observers said the 49ers should trade Young and keep Montana and Bono. However, the trade never happened.\n\n====1992 season: first MVP====\n[[File:Steve Young HOF jersey.jpg|thumb|Young's 1992 MVP season jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, OH]]\nBy the start of the [[1992 San Francisco 49ers season|1992 season]], it appeared that Young's starting job was in serious peril. In addition to having to compete with Bono, Montana appeared to be close to recovering from his elbow tendon surgery. San Francisco came close to trading Young to the [[1992 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]], but no deal was finalized and it turned out that Montana would not recover in time to start in the opening game. Montana would not return until the final game of the 1992 season, a Monday Night home game against the [[1992 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. Montana played the entire second half of that final game and guided the 49ers to victory.\n\nYoung ended up as San Francisco's starting quarterback, but once again got off to a rough start. On the fifth play of the opening game at the [[1992 New York Giants season|Giants]], he suffered a concussion and was replaced by Bono, who threw two touchdown passes while leading the 49ers to a 31&ndash;14 win. The following week, San Francisco lost 34&ndash;31 to the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]], despite a career-high 449 passing yards and three touchdowns from Young, in a game that for the first time in NFL history had zero punts from either team.\n\nYoung recovered and led the 49ers on a five-game winning streak, capped off by a 56\u201317 win over the [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in which Young passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns. After missing most of the next game (a 24\u201314 loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]]) with the flu, he led San Francisco to victory in all of their remaining games of the season, giving the team a 14&ndash;2 record. He went on to throw for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns, and rush for 73 yards, in a 20&ndash;13 divisional playoff win over the [[Washington Redskins]]. The 49ers lost the [[1992\u201393 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Dallas Cowboys 30, San Francisco 49ers 20|NFC title game]], however, 30&ndash;20 against the eventual [[Super Bowl XXVII|Super Bowl]] champion [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. Young threw for 313 yards, completing 71.4% of his passes while passing for one touchdown and rushing for another. He also threw two interceptions, but the final one came with the outcome of the game already decided.\n\nYoung finished the season with 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, along with an NFL-best 25 touchdown passes and 107.0 passer rating, earning him the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] and his first selection to the Pro Bowl. He was the first quarterback ever to record a triple-digit rating in consecutive seasons. Many credit Young's turnaround to the mentoring of the 49ers' new offensive coordinator [[Mike Shanahan]], who worked with Young on combining his running skill with on-the-move passing decisions.\n\n====1993 season====\nBefore the start of the 1993 season, team owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo, Jr.]] announced that he wanted Montana to resume his role as starting quarterback for the 49ers. However, a rift in the locker room had developed, with players split on whom they wanted at quarterback. In the spring of 1993, at Montana's request, San Francisco traded Montana to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Young was now the 49ers' undisputed starter, and would remain so for the rest of his career. But once again, he had a rough start to the season. Over the first four games of 1993, Young, who was hindered by a swollen thumb on his throwing hand, threw eight interceptions, more than he had thrown during the entire 1992 season. But after his thumb healed, Young went on an incredible streak over a span of seven games, throwing 16 touchdown passes with only 2 interceptions and a 122.2 passer rating. By the end of the year, Young set franchise records for most passing yards (4,023), and consecutive passes thrown without an interception (189), (later eclipsed by [[Alex Smith]] in 2012) while leading the NFL in touchdown passes (29) and passer rating (101.5). The team slipped to a 10&ndash;6 record, but advanced to the [[1993\u201394 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Dallas Cowboys 38, San Francisco 49ers 21|NFC championship game]] again by blowing out the [[1993 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 44&ndash;3 in the divisional round. However, once again they were defeated by the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], this time 38&ndash;21.\n\n====1994 season: second MVP and Super Bowl run====\nAfter several key free agent signings including All-Pro cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] and [[NFL Draft]] selections, the 49ers looked to win their first Super Bowl since [[1989 NFL season|1989]]. They started fast, beating the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] 44&ndash;14 on the strength of four touchdown passes from Young, one of four games during the regular season in which he had at least four. After a loss in a much-anticipated game to Joe Montana and the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], the 49ers won their next two games before losing to the [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 40&ndash;8 at Candlestick Park, a game in which Young was eventually benched in the middle of an offensive series. Although head coach George Seifert later said he only pulled Young because he was getting manhandled by the Eagles' defense, Young had had enough of being scapegoated for 49er shortfalls and loudly (and visibly) lambasted Seifert over his decision while standing on the sideline during the game. \n{{quote box|quote=\"Is this great or what? I mean, I haven't thrown six touchdown passes in a game in my life. Then I throw six in the Super Bowl! Unbelievable.\"|source=Steve Young<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/29/ | work=CNN | title=SI.com}}</ref>|width=20%|align=left}}\nBut the game was considered a turning point in the season; from there, Young led the team to 10 consecutive wins, by an average of 20 points, before losing the meaningless finale against the Vikings in which Young completed his first 12 of 13 attempts before going to the sidelines. They finished an NFL best 13&ndash;3, securing home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The 49ers had the number-one offense in the NFL, and were so dominant that Seifert often took Young out of games early if he felt that the 49ers had an insurmountable lead at the time.\n\nAfter an easy 44\u201315 victory over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs, the 49ers jumped out to a 31\u201314 halftime lead over the Dallas Cowboys in the [[1994\u201395 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28|NFC Championship Game]], holding on to win 38\u201328. Young threw for two touchdowns, while adding 47 yards and another touchdown on the ground. As a result, he went to his first Super Bowl as a starting quarterback. The 49ers were heavy favorites to become the first team with five Super Bowl victories.\n\nOn the strength of a six-touchdown performance that surpassed the previous Super Bowl record of five, owned by the man Young replaced, Joe Montana, Steve Young was named the MVP of [[Super Bowl XXIX]], as the 49ers defeated the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], 49\u201326. Young also threw for 325 yards and rushed for 49 yards, making him the first player ever to finish a Super Bowl as the game's leader in both rushing and passing yards.\n\nThe victory capped off an incredible year for Young, who had one of the best seasons by a quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 3,969 yards, a then-franchise record 35 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions, completed 70.3 percent of his passes \u2013 the highest completion percentage of the 1990s, third all-time, and at the time, the best completion percentage by any quarterback with more than 400 attempts (later eclipsed by [[Drew Brees]] in [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]]). Additionally, Young broke Joe Montana's single-season mark with a then-record 112.8 passer rating, and also once again demonstrated his great scrambling ability, accumulating another 289 yards and 7 touchdowns on the ground. For his record-breaking season performances, Young was awarded his second [[AP NFL MVP]] award, becoming the 7th player in NFL history to win both league and Super Bowl MVP honors in the same season.\n\n====Later years and injuries====\nIn the three years following Super Bowl XXIX, the 49ers would be eliminated each year by [[Brett Favre]] and the [[Green Bay Packers]], twice in San Francisco. In addition to the early playoff exits, Young suffered a series of injuries that forced him to miss several games from 1995 to 1997. Young entered the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|1998 season]] at age 37 and some began to wonder if his skills would diminish because of his history of injuries and a general decline in his game due to age. However, he silenced all critics once again, putting up career numbers in passing yards (4,170) and passing touchdowns (36). The 49ers finally beat Favre and the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] in an [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 30, Green Bay Packers 27|NFC wild card game]] that year, as Young threw the winning touchdown to wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] with three seconds remaining to win the game 30&ndash;27. In reference to [[Dwight Clark]]'s legendary catch against the Dallas Cowboys in the [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 28, Dallas Cowboys 27|1981 NFC championship game]], Owens's grab was called \"The Catch II.\" A week later, however, [[Garrison Hearst]] broke his ankle on the 49ers' first play from scrimmage. Without the threat of a running game, Young threw three interceptions (the last one a Hail Mary pass with under 30 seconds remaining in the game) and the 49ers were defeated by the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 20\u201318. Over that span of seasons from 1995 to 1998, Young led the NFL in passer rating twice (in 1996 and 1997), and led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes in 1998.\n\nThe [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999 season]] would turn out to be Steve Young's last in the NFL. Young was plagued by [[concussion]]s throughout his career. During a Week 3 ''Monday Night Football'' game against the [[1999 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], Young was violently sacked by Cardinals' cornerback [[Aeneas Williams]] due to a missed blocking assignment by 49ers' running back [[Lawrence Phillips]]. Young was knocked out of the game with a concussion, and didn't return again for the rest of the season due to symptoms of [[post-concussion syndrome]]. The concussion he suffered against the Cardinals was reportedly his second in a season that was only three weeks old, and the seventh (at least) of his career. Young was forced to retire at the end of the year; the team informed him that he would be released if he did not retire.

He also played for the NFL [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL). Young played [[college football]] for [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), setting school and NCAA records en route to being runner-up for the 1983 [[Heisman Trophy]]. \n\nYoung was named the AP's [[NFL Most Valuable Player]] in [[1992 NFL season|1992]] and [[1994 NFL season|1994]], and was the MVP of [[Super Bowl XXIX]]. During his 1994 MVP campaign, he set a new NFL record for passer rating at 112.8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/niHv9|title=Passer rating seasons, 110+, 150 att|work=Pro-Football-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}</ref> He is a member of the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nYoung was an efficient passer \u2013 leading the league in [[passer rating]] a record six times, and completion percentage and yards per attempt five times.<ref name=pfrleader>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/Y/YounSt00.htm#all_leaderboard|title=Steve Young Stats: Leaderboards|work=Pro-Football-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=January 4, 2017}}</ref> At the time of his retirement, he had the highest passer rating among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts (96.8). As of the end of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]], he is ranked fifth all-time in passer rating, and is ranked second highest amongst retired players, behind only [[Tony Romo]].<ref name=passrtgall>{{cite web | url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_rating_career.htm | title=NFL Passer Rating Career Leaders | website=Pro-Football-Reference.com | accessdate=January 4, 2017}}</ref> His 43 career rushing touchdowns are second among quarterbacks, while his 4,239 rushing yards ranks fourth all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-threat_quarterback#Rushing_yards | title=Dual-threat quarterback Rushing Yard Leaders | website=wikipedia.com}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], Young attended [[Greenwich High School]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], where he played quarterback on its Cardinals football team. He earned 1978 All-[[Fairfield County Interscholastic Athletic Conference|FCIAC]] West Division First Team honors in his junior year, his first year as a starter. In his senior year he rushed for 13 touchdowns and earned All-FCIAC West Division First Team honors, and was named to the [[Connecticut Association of Schools|CIAC]] All-State team. In the rush-first option offense run by Greenwich he completed only 41 percent of his throws for 1,220 yards, but ran the ball 267 times for 1,928 yards. On Thanksgiving Day in November 1979, Greenwich lost to Darien High School, known for its \"Tidal Wave Defense\", 17\u20130.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/23/archives/darien-defense-stops-greenwich-170-connecticut.html | title=Darien Defense Stops Greenwich, 17\u20130 | date=November 23, 1979 | work=The New York Times | accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref> During his senior year, he was co-captain of the football, basketball and baseball teams. In basketball, he averaged 15 points a game. In baseball, he hit .384 and played center field when he wasn't pitching. He was 5\u20131 and threw a 3\u20130 [[no-hitter]] against [[New Canaan High School]].\n\n==College football==\nYoung was heavily recruited by the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|University of North Carolina]]. Coach [[Dick Crum (American football)|Dick Crum]] was enamored by Young's running ability, and wanted him to run his option offense. Young instead chose BYU. Initially, he struggled at throwing the ball, and BYU's coaching staff considered switching him to defensive back because of his athleticism. However, he worked hard to improve his passing skills and eventually succeeded record-setting [[Jim McMahon]] as BYU's starting QB. Young's senior season (1983) was spectacular. He passed for 3,902 yards and 33 touchdowns in the regular season, and his 71.3% completion percentage set an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] single-season record. He also added 544 yards rushing. With Young at quarterback, BYU set an NCAA record by averaging 584.2 yards of total offense per game, with 370.5 of those yards coming from Young's passing and rushing. The Cougars finished the year with an impressive 11&ndash;1 record; Young was named First Team [[All-America]]n by several news organizations and received the [[Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award]], which recognizes the nation's best collegiate quarterback each year. He also finished second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]], behind [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] running back [[Mike Rozier]]. Young capped his college career by scoring the game-winning touchdown on a pass from the halfback in BYU's 21&ndash;17 victory over [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] in the [[1983 Holiday Bowl]].\n\nYoung finished his college career with 592 pass completions for 7,733 yards and 56 touchdowns, along with 1,048 yards and 18 touchdowns rushing. He was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2001.\n\n==Professional football==\n\n===USFL===\n====Los Angeles Express====\nYoung was selected by the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] in the first round (11th overall) of the [[1984 USFL Draft]]. He signed a record ten-year, $40 million contract with the [[United States Football League|USFL]]'s [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] in {{nowrap|March 1984.<ref name=esyffm>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wldWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8O4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6550%2C2839659 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |last=Peters |first=Ken |title=Express sign Young for $40 million |date=March 2, 1984 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=ywbospe>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5vdVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jOEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3664%2C1401376 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=sire services |title=Young will be old when pact ends |date=March 6, 1984 |page=E1}}</ref><ref name=yswexp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=48UoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8YIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6277%2C2052307 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |agency=(AP, ''Los Angeles Times, Washington Post'') |title=Young signs with Express |date=March 5, 1984 |page=D1}}</ref><ref name=expmp>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DfcoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EYcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4100%2C5565224 |work=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=UPI |title=Express paid 'market price' for QB |date=March 6, 1984 |page=D3}}</ref>}} He agreed to take his payment in the form of an [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] paid out over forty years to help the fledgling team. \n\nIt was taken for granted that Young would be the first pick in the [[1984 NFL Draft]], and that he would be selected by the then-moribund [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. Express general manager [[Don Klosterman]] told Young that if he signed with the Express, his head coach would be [[John Hadl]], a former All-Pro quarterback who had shepherded [[John Elway]] through his first year in the NFL. Klosterman also told Young that Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gilman]], who had been hired as a consultant, would tutor him on how to be a pro quarterback. Young was convinced, and signed with the Express.<ref name=Reeths/>\n\nAt the time, it was another huge signing by the fledgling league, which had already succeeded in signing both the reigning [[Heisman Trophy]] winner, running back [[Mike Rozier]] of Nebraska; and the previous winner, [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] running back [[Herschel Walker]]. After missing the first six games of his rookie season while taking some college classes in order to graduate on time, Young started the final twelve. He had a respectable year, highlighted by becoming the first pro football player ever to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 in a single game. Despite being surrounded with talent which included such future NFL players as [[Jojo Townsell]], [[Mel Gray (return specialist)|Mel Gray]], and [[Kevin Nelson (American football)|Kevin Nelson]], and making the playoffs in Young's first season, the Express was never able to create a sustaining fan base in [[Los Angeles]]. \n\nLate in the season, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an investigation of owner J. William Oldenburg's finances that suggested Oldenburg was not as well off as he claimed.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/03/business/the-unraveling-of-a-billionaire.html | title=The Unraveling of a 'Billionaire' | first=C. Bruce | last=Knecht | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 3, 1984}}</ref> The FBI had been investigating Oldenburg since the middle of the season. A week after the ''Times'' article, Oldenburg stopped paying the Express' bills, forcing the league to draw on the team's emergency line of credit to keep it going through the playoffs.<ref name=Buck>{{cite book|title=Football For A Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL|last=Pearlman|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|date=2018|isbn=978-0544454385}}</ref> [[Houston Gamblers]] minority partner Jay Roulier stepped in to buy the team, only to be pushed out when it emerged that he too had misrepresented his net worth.

Before one game, the team bus driver refused to drive the Express to their final home game \u2013 which had been moved to [[Los Angeles Pierce College]] in the San Fernando Valley \u2013 unless he was paid up front in cash. Young contributed some money, as did the team trainer, and the driver took them to the game. In the season finale at [[Orlando Renegades|Orlando]], Young had to line up at tailback because a rash of injuries had left the Express without any healthy running backs. The owners had refused to allocate any money to allow the Express to replace injured players.<ref name=Reeths/><ref name=Buck/>\n\nIt was reported that Young had insured the contract and would still be paid until 2027.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1825502-steve-young-will-make-1-million-in-2014-from-usfl-deal-signed-in-1984 | title=Steve Young Will Make $1 Million in 2014 from USFL Deal Signed in 1984 | first=Tim | last=Keeney | date=October 25, 2013 | website=[[Bleacher Report]]}}</ref> However, a 1985 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article stated that he received a $1.4 million settlement on the annuity.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-08-10-sp-3859-story.html | title=USFL Confirms Young Is Highest-Paid Player at $2.4 Million a Year | first=Bob | last=Oates | date=August 10, 1985 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe league ceased operations in 1986 after losing most of its claims in an [[United States Football League#USFL v. NFL lawsuit|antitrust suit against the NFL]], with its top talent absorbed by the NFL in a dispersal draft conducted in the aftermath.\n\n===NFL===\n====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====\nYoung grew increasingly dissatisfied with the disarray surrounding the Express. Just a week before what proved to be the last USFL title game, Young gave the USFL an ultimatum \u2013 find a new owner for the Express, or allow him to buy out his contract and go to the NFL.<ref name=Buck/> Soon after the league decided to suspend the Express's operations for the 1986 season, Young bought out his Express contract and signed with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who had made him the first pick in a [[1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players|supplemental draft of USFL and CFL players]] a year earlier. \n\nBy this time, the Bucs were in the midst of what would be 12 consecutive 10-loss seasons. They posted identical 2&ndash;14 records in Young's two seasons with them, going 3&ndash;16 with him as a starter. Young threw for only 11 touchdowns with 21 interceptions while completing fewer than 55% of his passes.\n\n====San Francisco 49ers====\nThe Buccaneers selected [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] first overall in the [[1987 NFL Draft]] because Young was deemed a bust. Young was traded to the San Francisco 49ers on April 24, 1987 to serve as a backup to [[Joe Montana]]. 49ers coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] was impressed by Young's natural abilities, and believed his lackluster numbers were primarily due to the lack of talent around him in Tampa Bay. \n\nThe Buccaneers received second and fourth round draft picks in the trade, which they used to draft Miami [[linebacker]] [[Winston Moss]], and [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]] [[wide receiver]] [[Bruce Hill (American football)|Bruce Hill]], respectively.\n\n====Montana's backup: 1987\u20131990====\nYoung played behind Montana for four years, but shone as a backup. Substituting for an injured Montana, early in the first quarter of a [[1987 San Francisco 49ers season|1987]] game against the [[1987 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], he threw four touchdown passes in a 41\u20130 victory. In their 1987 divisional playoff game against the [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], he replaced Montana in the second half after the team fell behind 27\u201310. The 49ers still lost the game, but Young had a good performance, completing 12 of 17 pass attempts for 158 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading San Francisco in rushing with 72 yards and a touchdown on six carries. On October 30, 1988, Young ran for a 49-yard, game-winning touchdown against the [[1988 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]]. He started the game out with a 73-yard touchdown pass to [[John Taylor (American football player)|John Taylor]], after Montana went down with an injury. The play earned the 49ers a 24\u201321 victory and a bit of revenge on the Vikings for their previous season's playoff loss.  The win turned out to be crucial, as without it the 49ers would have finished the season 9\u20137 and missed the playoffs, as two other teams in their division, the [[1988 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] and [[1988 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], had 10\u20136 records.  Instead, the 49ers won their division, earned the #2 playoff seed, and went on to win the [[Super Bowl XXIII|Super Bowl]].\n\nIn 1989, he displayed potential to become the team's starter in the future. While Montana won the NFL MVP award and led the team to victory in [[Super Bowl XXIV]], Young still had a good season, completing 69% of his passes for 1,001 yards and eight touchdowns, with only three interceptions. On October 22, 1989, he posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3 when he completed 11 of 12 passes for 188 yards and three touchdown passes in a 37\u201320 victory over the [[1989 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]].\n\nHe rushed for a career-high 102 yards on just eight carries against the [[1990 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] on December 23, 1990, making him only the second 49ers quarterback to rush for at least 100 yards in a single game. The 49ers lost the game 13\u201310.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199012230sfo.htm | title=New Orleans Saints at San Francisco 49ers \u2013 December 23rd, 1990 | website=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIn his four seasons as a backup, Young threw 23 touchdown passes and only six interceptions.\n\n====1991 season====\nFollowing an injury to Montana's elbow in the [[NFL playoffs, 1990-91#NFC Championship: New York Giants 15.2C San Francisco 49ers 13|1990 NFC Championship Game]], which forced him to miss the entire 1991 season, Young got his chance to lead the 49ers. He got off to a rough start. Midway through the season, the 49ers found themselves struggling with a 4&ndash;4 record. In the ninth game of the season, after throwing a franchise-record 97-yard touchdown pass to Taylor, Young suffered a knee injury and was replaced by backup quarterback [[Steve Bono]]. After a loss in that game and the next, Bono led the 49ers to five consecutive victories, playing so well that coach [[George Seifert]] decided to keep him in the starting lineup after Young had recovered. It wasn't until late in the 15th game of the season, after Bono went down with an injury of his own, that Young got to play again. Young then closed out the season by throwing for 338 yards and three touchdowns and also rushing for 63 yards and another touchdown in a 52&ndash;14 win over the [[Chicago Bears]] in a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game at [[Candlestick Park]].\n\nYoung finished the season with an NFL best 101.8 passer rating. Despite missing five full games and most of a sixth, he still threw for 2,517 yards and 17 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions. But despite Young's strong season, the season for the team was widely regarded as a disappointment. The 49ers had slipped from a 14&ndash;2 record in the previous season to a 10&ndash;6 record in 1991. While 10 wins is usually enough to make the playoffs, this time it was not, and San Francisco ended up not playing in the postseason for the first time since 1982. It was thought by many that Young's days as the 49ers starter were numbered due to the impending return of Montana from the injury to his right elbow, and some observers said the 49ers should trade Young and keep Montana and Bono. However, the trade never happened.\n\n====1992 season: first MVP====\n[[File:Steve Young HOF jersey.jpg|thumb|Young's 1992 MVP season jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, OH]]\nBy the start of the [[1992 San Francisco 49ers season|1992 season]], it appeared that Young's starting job was in serious peril. In addition to having to compete with Bono, Montana appeared to be close to recovering from his elbow tendon surgery. San Francisco came close to trading Young to the [[1992 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]], but no deal was finalized and it turned out that Montana would not recover in time to start in the opening game. Montana would not return until the final game of the 1992 season, a Monday Night home game against the [[1992 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. Montana played the entire second half of that final game and guided the 49ers to victory.\n\nYoung ended up as San Francisco's starting quarterback, but once again got off to a rough start. On the fifth play of the opening game at the [[1992 New York Giants season|Giants]], he suffered a concussion and was replaced by Bono, who threw two touchdown passes while leading the 49ers to a 31&ndash;14 win. The following week, San Francisco lost 34&ndash;31 to the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]], despite a career-high 449 passing yards and three touchdowns from Young, in a game that for the first time in NFL history had zero punts from either team.\n\nYoung recovered and led the 49ers on a five-game winning streak, capped off by a 56\u201317 win over the [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in which Young passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns. After missing most of the next game (a 24\u201314 loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]]) with the flu, he led San Francisco to victory in all of their remaining games of the season, giving the team a 14&ndash;2 record. He went on to throw for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns, and rush for 73 yards, in a 20&ndash;13 divisional playoff win over the [[Washington Redskins]]. The 49ers lost the [[1992\u201393 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Dallas Cowboys 30, San Francisco 49ers 20|NFC title game]], however, 30&ndash;20 against the eventual [[Super Bowl XXVII|Super Bowl]] champion [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. Young threw for 313 yards, completing 71.4% of his passes while passing for one touchdown and rushing for another. He also threw two interceptions, but the final one came with the outcome of the game already decided.\n\nYoung finished the season with 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, along with an NFL-best 25 touchdown passes and 107.0 passer rating, earning him the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] and his first selection to the Pro Bowl. He was the first quarterback ever to record a triple-digit rating in consecutive seasons. Many credit Young's turnaround to the mentoring of the 49ers' new offensive coordinator [[Mike Shanahan]], who worked with Young on combining his running skill with on-the-move passing decisions.\n\n====1993 season====\nBefore the start of the 1993 season, team owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo, Jr.]] announced that he wanted Montana to resume his role as starting quarterback for the 49ers. However, a rift in the locker room had developed, with players split on whom they wanted at quarterback. In the spring of 1993, at Montana's request, San Francisco traded Montana to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Young was now the 49ers' undisputed starter, and would remain so for the rest of his career. But once again, he had a rough start to the season. Over the first four games of 1993, Young, who was hindered by a swollen thumb on his throwing hand, threw eight interceptions, more than he had thrown during the entire 1992 season. But after his thumb healed, Young went on an incredible streak over a span of seven games, throwing 16 touchdown passes with only 2 interceptions and a 122.2 passer rating. By the end of the year, Young set franchise records for most passing yards (4,023), and consecutive passes thrown without an interception (189), (later eclipsed by [[Alex Smith]] in 2012) while leading the NFL in touchdown passes (29) and passer rating (101.5). The team slipped to a 10&ndash;6 record, but advanced to the [[1993\u201394 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Dallas Cowboys 38, San Francisco 49ers 21|NFC championship game]] again by blowing out the [[1993 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 44&ndash;3 in the divisional round. However, once again they were defeated by the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], this time 38&ndash;21.\n\n====1994 season: second MVP and Super Bowl run====\nAfter several key free agent signings including All-Pro cornerback [[Deion Sanders]] and [[NFL Draft]] selections, the 49ers looked to win their first Super Bowl since [[1989 NFL season|1989]]. They started fast, beating the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] 44&ndash;14 on the strength of four touchdown passes from Young, one of four games during the regular season in which he had at least four. After a loss in a much-anticipated game to Joe Montana and the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], the 49ers won their next two games before losing to the [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 40&ndash;8 at Candlestick Park, a game in which Young was eventually benched in the middle of an offensive series. Although head coach George Seifert later said he only pulled Young because he was getting manhandled by the Eagles' defense, Young had had enough of being scapegoated for 49er shortfalls and loudly (and visibly) lambasted Seifert over his decision while standing on the sideline during the game. \n{{quote box|quote=\"Is this great or what? I mean, I haven't thrown six touchdown passes in a game in my life. Then I throw six in the Super Bowl! Unbelievable.\"|source=Steve Young<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/features/superbowl/archives/29/ | work=CNN | title=SI.com}}</ref>|width=20%|align=left}}\nBut the game was considered a turning point in the season; from there, Young led the team to 10 consecutive wins, by an average of 20 points, before losing the meaningless finale against the Vikings in which Young completed his first 12 of 13 attempts before going to the sidelines. They finished an NFL best 13&ndash;3, securing home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The 49ers had the number-one offense in the NFL, and were so dominant that Seifert often took Young out of games early if he felt that the 49ers had an insurmountable lead at the time.\n\nAfter an easy 44\u201315 victory over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs, the 49ers jumped out to a 31\u201314 halftime lead over the Dallas Cowboys in the [[1994\u201395 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28|NFC Championship Game]], holding on to win 38\u201328. Young threw for two touchdowns, while adding 47 yards and another touchdown on the ground. As a result, he went to his first Super Bowl as a starting quarterback. The 49ers were heavy favorites to become the first team with five Super Bowl victories.\n\nOn the strength of a six-touchdown performance that surpassed the previous Super Bowl record of five, owned by the man Young replaced, Joe Montana, Steve Young was named the MVP of [[Super Bowl XXIX]], as the 49ers defeated the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], 49\u201326. Young also threw for 325 yards and rushed for 49 yards, making him the first player ever to finish a Super Bowl as the game's leader in both rushing and passing yards.\n\nThe victory capped off an incredible year for Young, who had one of the best seasons by a quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 3,969 yards, a then-franchise record 35 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions, completed 70.3 percent of his passes \u2013 the highest completion percentage of the 1990s, third all-time, and at the time, the best completion percentage by any quarterback with more than 400 attempts (later eclipsed by [[Drew Brees]] in [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009]]). Additionally, Young broke Joe Montana's single-season mark with a then-record 112.8 passer rating, and also once again demonstrated his great scrambling ability, accumulating another 289 yards and 7 touchdowns on the ground. For his record-breaking season performances, Young was awarded his second [[AP NFL MVP]] award, becoming the 7th player in NFL history to win both league and Super Bowl MVP honors in the same season.\n\n====Later years and injuries====\nIn the three years following Super Bowl XXIX, the 49ers would be eliminated each year by [[Brett Favre]] and the [[Green Bay Packers]], twice in San Francisco. In addition to the early playoff exits, Young suffered a series of injuries that forced him to miss several games from 1995 to 1997. Young entered the [[1998 San Francisco 49ers season|1998 season]] at age 37 and some began to wonder if his skills would diminish because of his history of injuries and a general decline in his game due to age. However, he silenced all critics once again, putting up career numbers in passing yards (4,170) and passing touchdowns (36). The 49ers finally beat Favre and the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] in an [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 30, Green Bay Packers 27|NFC wild card game]] that year, as Young threw the winning touchdown to wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]] with three seconds remaining to win the game 30&ndash;27. In reference to [[Dwight Clark]]'s legendary catch against the Dallas Cowboys in the [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 28, Dallas Cowboys 27|1981 NFC championship game]], Owens's grab was called \"The Catch II.\" A week later, however, [[Garrison Hearst]] broke his ankle on the 49ers' first play from scrimmage. Without the threat of a running game, Young threw three interceptions (the last one a Hail Mary pass with under 30 seconds remaining in the game) and the 49ers were defeated by the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 20\u201318. Over that span of seasons from 1995 to 1998, Young led the NFL in passer rating twice (in 1996 and 1997), and led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes in 1998.\n\nThe [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999 season]] would turn out to be Steve Young's last in the NFL. Young was plagued by [[concussion]]s throughout his career. During a Week 3 ''Monday Night Football'' game against the [[1999 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]], Young was violently sacked by Cardinals' cornerback [[Aeneas Williams]] due to a missed blocking assignment by 49ers' running back [[Lawrence Phillips]]. Young was knocked out of the game with a concussion, and didn't return again for the rest of the season due to symptoms of [[post-concussion syndrome]]. The concussion he suffered against the Cardinals was reportedly his second in a season that was only three weeks old, and the seventh (at least) of his career. Young was forced to retire at the end of the year; the team informed him that he would be released if he did not retire. Although Young was offered a job as the starting quarterback of the [[Denver Broncos]] (where his former offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, was the head coach), he retired because of his repeated concussions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20000429/ai_n9970931/ | title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|website=findarticles.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/12968406/use-your-head-brian-be-smart-and-walk-away-now?tag=globalNavNFL;headlines | title=Use Your Head, Brian: Be Smart and Walk Away Now | first=Clark | last=Judge | date=February 23, 2010 | publisher=CBS Sports}}</ref> In a 2013 ''[[Frontline (American TV program)|Frontline]]'' interview, Young said that, partially based upon their own experiences, he and many retired players are increasingly concerned about repeated [[Concussions in American football|concussions and subconcussive hits]].

It's only when you go through what I am going through that you understand that life is generous.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/23699697|title=Joost van der Westhuizen: Still fighting on his deathbed|date=2013-08-19|newspaper=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nIn May 2011, van der Westhuizen's publicist confirmed that he had been diagnosed with [[motor neuron disease]].<ref name=\"Guardian May2011\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/12/joost-van-der-westhuizen-motor-neurone|title=Joost van der Westhuizen diagnosed with motor neurone disease|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 May 2011|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> Some weakness had first been noticed in his right arm near the end of 2008, but he had put this down to the aftereffects of an old rugby injury.<ref name=Peacock>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/23699697|title=Joost van der Westhuizen: Still fighting on his deathbed|first=James|last=Peacock|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 August 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> A few months later, Dr Kelbrick, his personal doctor and a family friend, noticed his right arm weakness and arranged for tests.<ref name=\"Guardian May2011\"/> At that time, Van der Westhuizen was given between two and five years to live.<ref name=Peacock/>\n\nAn August 2013 [[BBC Sport]] report illustrated the progress of his disease \u2014 by then, Van der Westhuizen was confined to a wheelchair, and his speech had grown increasingly slurred.

In the 1990s, they expanded formats to include [[contemporary Christian music]] (with most stations under this format branded as \"The Fish\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://salem.cc/stationcat/contemporary-christian-music|title=Contemporary Christian Music - Station Formats - Salem Media Group|website=salem.cc}}</ref> news talk (branded as \"The Answer\"), Spanish-language Christian content and most recently{{when|date=September 2013}}, business programming.<ref name = \"Salem history\">{{cite web|url=http://salem.cc/about-us/history|title=History - Salem Media Group|website=salem.cc}}</ref>\n\nMany of Salem's stations are licensed to subsidiaries, organized by geographical area and media cluster as the company has acquired new stations and their previous licensees.\n\nSalem Communications Corp acquired Twitter curation site, Twitchy.com.
