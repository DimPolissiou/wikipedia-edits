He was the elder son of [[Alfred the Great]] and his wife [[Ealhswith]]. When Edward succeeded to the throne, he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin [[\u00c6thelwold \u00e6theling|\u00c6thelwold]], who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, [[\u00c6thelred I, King of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].\n\nAlfred had succeeded \u00c6thelred as king of [[Wessex]] in 871, and almost faced defeat against the Danish [[Viking]]s until his decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and eastern [[Mercia]], leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and married his daughter [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], and around 886 Alfred adopted the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule.\n\nIn 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army, ending the threat from the northern Vikings. In the 910s, Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who had succeeded as Lady of the Mercians following the death of her husband in 911. Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period, and after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in June 918, her daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], briefly became second Lady of the Mercians, but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct rule on Mercia. By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at [[Chester]], and after putting it down he died at [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]] in [[Cheshire]] on 17 July 924. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[\u00c6thelstan]].\n\nEdward was admired by medieval chroniclers, and in the view of [[William of Malmesbury]], he was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\" but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and [[Nick Higham (historian)|Nick Higham]] described him as \"perhaps the most neglected of English kings\", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom.\n\n==Background==\n[[Mercia]] was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by [[Wessex]] at the [[Battle of Ellandun]] in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|pp=11\u201312}} In 865 the Danish Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to pay off the Vikings, who invaded [[Northumbria]] the following year. They appointed a puppet king in 867, and then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867\u2013868. King [[Burgred]] of Mercia was joined by King [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex]] and his brother, the future [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]], for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Danes conquered East Anglia, and in 874 they expelled King Burgred and, with their support, [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]] became the last King of Mercia. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. In early 878 they invaded Wessex, and many West Saxons submitted to them. Alfred, who was now king, was reduced to a remote base in the [[Isle of Athelney]] in [[Somerset]], but the situation was transformed when he won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]]. He was thus able to prevent the Vikings from taking Wessex and western Mercia, although they still occupied Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=245\u201357}}\n\n==Childhood==\n[[File:Will of Alfred the Great (New Minster Liber Vitae) - BL Stowe MS 944, f 30v.jpg|thumb|A page from the will of Alfred the Great, which left the bulk of his estate to Edward]]\nEdward's parents, Alfred and [[Ealhswith]], married in 868. Her father was [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]], and her mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family. Alfred and Ealhswith had five children who survived childhood. The oldest was [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], who married [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], and ruled as Lady of the Mercians after his death. Edward was next, and the second daughter, [[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]], became [[Shaftesbury Abbey|abbess of Shaftesbury]]. The third daughter, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]], married [[Baldwin II, Margrave of Flanders|Baldwin, Count of Flanders]], and the younger son, [[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]], was given a scholarly education, including learning Latin. This would usually suggest that he was intended for the church, but it is unlikely in \u00c6thelweard's case as he later had sons. There were also an unknown number of children who died young. Neither part of Edward's name, which means 'protector of wealth', had been used previously by the West Saxon royal house, and [[Barbara Yorke]] suggests that he may have been named after his maternal grandmother Eadburh, reflecting the West Saxon policy of strengthening links with Mercia.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25\u201328}}\n\nHistorians estimate that Edward was probably born in the mid-870s. His eldest sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, was probably born about a year after her parents' marriage, and Edward was brought up with his youngest sister, \u00c6lfthryth; Yorke argues that he was therefore probably nearer in age to \u00c6lfthryth than \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. Edward led troops in battle in 893, and must have been of marriageable age in that year as his oldest son \u00c6thelstan was born about 894.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=25\u201326|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} According to [[Asser]] in his ''Life of King Alfred'', Edward and \u00c6lfthryth were educated at court by male and female tutors, and read ecclesiastical and secular works in English, such as the [[Psalms]] and [[Old English poetry|Old English poems]]. They were taught the courtly qualities of gentleness and humility, and Asser wrote that they were obedient to their father and friendly to visitors. This is the only known case of an Anglo-Saxon prince and princess receiving the same upbringing.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==\u00c6theling==\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAs a son of a king, Edward was an [[\u00e6theling]], a prince of the royal house who was eligible for kingship. Even though he had the advantage of being the eldest son of the reigning king, his accession was not assured as he had cousins who had a strong claim to the throne. [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]] were sons of \u00c6thelred, Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, but they had been passed over because they were infants when their father died. Asser gives more information about Edward's childhood and youth than is known about other Anglo-Saxon princes, providing details about the training of a prince in a period of [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] influence, and Yorke suggest that we may know so much due to Alfred's efforts to portray his son as the most throneworthy \u00e6theling.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25, 29\u201330}}\n\n\u00c6thelhelm is only recorded in Alfred's will of the mid-880s, and probably died at some time in the next decade, but \u00c6thelwold is listed above Edward in the only [[charter]] where he appears, probably indicating a higher status. \u00c6thelwold may also have had an advantage because his mother Wulfthryth witnessed a charter as queen, whereas Edward's mother Ealhswith never had a higher status than king's wife.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00c6thelhelm|1y= PASE |2a1=S 356|2y=Sawyer|3a1=Yorke|3y=2001|3p=31}} However, Alfred was in a position to give his own son considerable advantages. In his will, he left only a handful of estates to his brother's sons, and the bulk of his property to Edward, including all his [[Bookland (law)|booklands]] (land vested in a charter which could be alienated by the holder, as opposed to folkland, which had to pass to [[heirs of the body]]) in [[Kent]].{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes and Lapidge|1y=1983|1pp=175\u201376, 321\u201322|2a1=Yorke|2y=2001|2p=30}} Alfred also advanced men who could be depended on to support his plans for his succession, such as his brother-in-law, a Mercian ealdorman called \u00c6thelwulf, and his son-in-law \u00c6thelred. Edward witnessed several of his father's charters, and often accompanied him on royal peregrinations.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201335}} In a Kentish charter of 898 Edward witnessed as ''rex Saxonum'', suggesting that Alfred may have followed the strategy adopted by his grandfather [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] of strengthening his son's claim to succeed to the West Saxon throne by making him sub-king of Kent.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=32}}\n\nOnce Edward grew up, Alfred was able to give him military commands and experience in royal administration.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201332}} The English defeated renewed Viking attacks in 893 to 896, and in [[Richard Abels]]' view, the glory belonged to \u00c6thelred and Edward rather than Alfred himself. In 893 Edward defeated the Vikings in the Battle of Farnham, although he was unable to follow up his victory as his troops' period of service had expired and he had to release them. The situation was saved by the arrival of troops from London led by \u00c6thelred.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=294\u2013304}} Yorke argues that although Alfred packed the [[witan]] with members whose interests lay in the continuation of Alfred's line, that may not have been sufficient to ensure Edward's accession if he had not displayed his fitness for kingship.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=37}}\n\nIn about 893, Edward probably married [[Ecgwynn]], who bore him two children, the future King \u00c6thelstan and a daughter who married [[Sitric C\u00e1ech]], a Viking King of York. The twelfth-century chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] described Ecgwynn as an ''illustris femina'' (noble lady), and stated that Edward chose \u00c6thelstan as his heir as king. She may have been related to St [[Dunstan]], the aristocratic tenth-century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. But William of Malmesbury also stated that \u00c6thelstan's accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Bailey|2y=2001|2p=114|3a1=Mynors, Thomson and Winterbottom|3y=1998|3p=199}} The suggestion that Ecgwynn was Edward's mistress is accepted by some historians such as [[Simon Keynes]] and Richard Abels,{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=1999|1p=467|2a1=Abels|2y=1998|2p=307}} but Yorke and \u00c6thelstan's biographer, [[Sarah Foot]], disagree, arguing that the allegations should be seen in the context of the disputed succession in 924, and were not an issue in the 890s.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1p=33|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=31}} Ecgwynn probably died by 899, as around the time of Alfred's death Edward married [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], the daughter of Ealdorman \u00c6thelhelm, probably of [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=33}}\n\n[[Janet Nelson]] suggests that there was conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s. She points out that the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', produced under court auspices in the 890s, does not mention Edward's military successes. These are known only from the late tenth century chronicle of [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], such as his account of the Battle of Farnham, in which in Nelson's view \"Edward's military prowess, and popularity with a following of young warriors, are highlighted\". Towards the end of his life Alfred invested his young grandson \u00c6thelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to the kingship. Nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by Edward to support the accession of his own son, on the other hand it may have been intended by Alfred as part of a scheme to divide the kingdom between his son and grandson. \u00c6thelstan was sent to be brought up in Mercia by \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and \u00c6thelred, but it is not known whether this was Alfred's idea or Edward's. Alfred's wife Ealhswith was ignored in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' in her husband's lifetime, but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded. This may be because she supported her son against her husband.{{sfn|Nelson|1996| pp= 53\u201354, 63\u201366}}\n\n==\u00c6thelwold's revolt==\n{{further|\u00c6thelwold's Revolt}}\n[[File:Coin of King Edward the Elder.JPG|thumb|240px|Coin of Edward the Elder]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 and Edward succeeded to the throne, but \u00c6thelwold disputed the succession.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He seized the royal estates of [[Wimborne]], symbolically important as the place where his father was buried, and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], both in [[Dorset]]. Edward marched with his army to the nearby [[Iron Age]] hillfort at [[Badbury Rings]]. \u00c6thelwold declared that he would live or die at Wimborne, but then left in the night and rode to Northumbria, where the Danes accepted him as king.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=321|2a1=Lavelle|2y=2009|2pp=53, 61}} Edward was crowned on 8{{nbsp}}June 900 at [[Kingston upon Thames]].{{efn|The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph of Diceto]] stated that the coronation took place at Kingston, and this is accepted by [[Simon Keynes]], although [[Sarah Foot]] says that \"Edward might well have held the ceremony at Winchester\".{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=2001| 1p= 48|2a1= Foot|2y=2011| 2p= 74, n. 46}}}}\n\nIn 901, \u00c6thelwold came with a fleet to [[Essex]], and the following year he persuaded the East Anglian Danes to invade English Mercia and northern Wessex, where his army looted and then returned home. Edward retaliated by ravaging East Anglia, but when he retreated the men of Kent disobeyed the order to retire, and were intercepted by the Danish army. The two sides met at the [[Battle of the Holme]] (perhaps [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme]] in [[Huntingdonshire]]) on 13 December 902. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', the Danes \"kept the place of slaughter\", meaning that they won the battle, but they suffered heavy losses, including \u00c6thelwold and a King Eohric, possibly of the East Anglian Danes. Kentish losses included Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent and father of Edward's third wife, Eadgifu. \u00c6thelwold's death ended the threat to Edward's throne.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1pp=321\u2013322|2a1=Hart|2y=1992|2pp=512\u201315|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}}\n\n==King of the Anglo-Saxons==\nIn London in 2020Alfred had received the formal submission of \"all the English people that were not under subjection to the Danes\", and thereafter he adopted the title ''Anglorum Saxonum rex'' (King of the Anglo-Saxons), which is used in his later charters and all but two of Edward's. This is seen by Keynes as \"the invention of a wholly new and distinctive polity\", covering both West Saxons and Mercians, which was inherited by Edward with the support of Mercians at the West Saxon court, of whom the most important was [[Plegmund]], Archbishop of Canterbury. In 903 Edward issued several charters concerning land in Mercia. Three of them are witnessed by the Mercian leaders and their daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], and they all contain a statement that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d \"then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians, under the aforesaid king\". Other charters were issued by the Mercian leaders which did not contain any acknowledgment of Edward's authority, but they did not issue their own coinage.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=44\u201358}} This view of Edward's status is accepted by Martin Ryan, who states that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had \"a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority\" in English Mercia.{{sfn|Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nOther historians disagree. [[Pauline Stafford]] describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\",{{sfn|Stafford|2001|p=45}} while in Charles Insley's view Mercia kept its independence until \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in 918.{{sfn|Insley|2009|p=330}} Michael Davidson contrasts the 903 charters with one of 901 in which the Mercian rulers were \"by grace of God, holding, governing and defending the monarchy of the Mercians\". Davidson comments that \"the evidence for Mercian subordination is decidedly mixed. Ultimately, the ideology of the 'Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons' may have been less successful in achieving the absorption of Mercia and more something which I would see as a murky political coup.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' was compiled at the West Saxon court from the 890s, and the entries for the late ninth and early tenth centuries are seen by historians as reflecting the West Saxon viewpoint; Davidson observes that \"Alfred and Edward possessed skilled 'spin doctors'\".{{sfnm|1a1=Davidson|1y=2001|1pp=203\u201305|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=43}} Some versions of the ''Chronicle'' incorporate part of a lost ''Mercian Register'', which gives a Mercian perspective and details of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's campaign against the Vikings.{{sfn |Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries, connection by marriage with the West Saxon royal house was seen as prestigious by continental rulers. In the mid-890s Alfred had married his daughter \u00c6lfthryth to Baldwin II of Flanders, and in 919 Edward married his daughter [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]] to [[Charles the Simple]], King of [[West Francia]]. In 925, after Edward's death, another daughter [[Eadgyth]] married [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], the future [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]] and (after Eadgyth's death) [[Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Sharp|2001|pp=81\u201386}}\n\n==Conquest of the southern Danelaw==\nNo battles are recorded between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danish Vikings for several years after the [[Battle of the Holme]], but in 906 Edward agreed peace with the East Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, suggesting that there had been conflict. According to one version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' he made peace \"of necessity\", which implies that he was forced to buy them off.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He encouraged Englishmen to purchase land in Danish territory, and two charters survive relating to estates in [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Derbyshire]].{{sfn|Abrams|2001|p=136}} In 909 Edward sent a combined West Saxon and Mercian army which harassed the Northumbrian Danes, and seized the bones of the Northumbrian royal saint [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] from [[Bardney Abbey]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. Oswald was [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|a new Mercian minster]] established by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in [[Gloucester]] and the Danes were compelled to accept peace on Edward's terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=323|2a1=Heighway|2y=2001|2p=108}} In the following year, the Northumbrian Danes retaliated by raiding Mercia, but on their way home they were met by a combined Mercian and West Saxon army at the [[Battle of Tettenhall]], where the Vikings suffered a disastrous defeat. After that, the Northumbrian Danes never ventured south of the River [[Humber]], and Edward and his Mercian allies were able to concentrate on conquering the southern Danelaw in East Anglia and the [[Five Boroughs]] of Viking east Mercia: [[Derby]], [[Leicester]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}} \n\nIn 911 \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, died, and Edward took control of the Mercian lands around London and [[Oxford]]. \u00c6thelred was succeeded as ruler by his widow \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as Lady of the Mercians, and she had probably been acting as ruler for several years as \u00c6thelred seems to have been incapacitated in later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=324, n. 1|2a1=Wainwright|2y=1975|2pp=308\u201309|3a1=Bailey|3y=2001|3p=113}}\n\nEdward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d then began the construction of fortresses to guard against Viking attacks and protect territory captured from them. In November 911, he constructed a fort on the north bank of the [[River Lea]] at [[Hertford]] to guard against attack by the Danes of [[Bedford]] and [[Cambridge]]. In 912, he marched with his army to [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex, and ordered the building of a fort at [[Witham]] and a second fort at Hertford, which protected London from attack and encouraged many English living under Danish rule in Essex to submit to him. In 913 there was a pause in his activities, although \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d continued her fortress building in Mercia.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=324\u201325}} \n\nIn 914, a Viking army sailed from [[Brittany]] and ravaged the [[Severn]] estuary. It then attacked [[Ergyng]] in south-east Wales (now [[Archenfield]] in [[Herefordshire]]) and captured the Bishop, referred to as Cameleac, Cimeliauc and Cyfeilliog, depending on the source. Edward ransomed him for the large sum of forty pounds of silver. The Vikings were defeated in 915 by the armies of Hereford and Gloucester, and gave hostages and oaths to keep the peace. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', one of the two jarls who had led the raids, Hroald, was killed, as was the brother of the other jarl.<ref>Worcester Manuscript, p. 99, quoted in {{cite web |url=https://htt.herefordshire.gov.uk/herefordshires-past/the-anglo-saxon-period/the-vikings/the-vikings-in-herefordshire/ |title=The Vikings in Herefordshire |date=2005|last=Greene|first=Miranda |publisher=Herefordshire Council |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nEdward maintained an army on the south side of the estuary in case the Vikings broke their promises, and he twice had to repel attacks. In the autumn the Vikings moved on to Ireland. The episode suggests that south-east Wales fell within the West Saxon sphere of power, unlike [[Brycheiniog]] just to the north, where Mercia was dominant.{{sfnm|1a1=Charles-Edwards|1y=2013|1p=506|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} In late 914 Edward built two forts at [[Buckingham]], and Earl Thurketil, the leader of the Danish army at Bedford submitted to him. The following year he occupied Bedford, and constructed another fortification on the south bank of the [[River Great Ouse]] against a Viking one on the north bank. In 916 Edward returned to Essex and built a fort at Maldon to bolster the defence of Witham. He also helped Earl Thurketil and his followers to leave England, reducing the number of Viking armies in the Midlands.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=325\u201326}}\n\nThe decisive year in the war was 917. In April Edward built a fort at [[Towcester]] as a defence against the Danes of [[Northampton]], and another at an unidentified place called Wigingamere. The Danes launched unsuccessful attacks on Towcester, Bedford and Wigingamere, while \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d captured Derby, showing the value of the English defensive measures, which were aided by disunity and a lack of coordination among the Viking armies. The Danes had built their own fortress at [[Tempsford]] in Bedfordshire, but at the end of the summer the English stormed it and killed the last Danish king of East Anglia. The English then took [[Colchester]], although they did not try to hold it. The Danes retaliated by sending a large army to lay siege to Maldon, but the garrison held out until it was relieved and the retreating army was heavily defeated. Edward then returned to Towcester and reinforced its fort with a stone wall, and the Danes of nearby Northampton submitted to him. The armies of Cambridge and East Anglia also submitted, and by the end of the year the only Danish armies still holding out were those of four of the Five Boroughs, Leicester, Stamford, Nottingham, and Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=327\u201329}}\n\nIn early 918, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d secured the submission of Leicester without a fight, and the Danes of Northumbrian York offered her their allegiance, probably for protection against [[Norwegians#Viking Age|Norse]] (Norwegian) Vikings who had invaded Northumbria from Ireland, but she died on 12 June before she could take up the proposal. The same offer is not known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. According to the main West Saxon version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death the Mercians submitted to Edward, but the Mercian version (the ''Mercian Register'') states that in December 918 her daughter \u00c6lfwynn \"was deprived of all authority in Mercia and taken into Wessex\". Mercia may have made a bid for continued semi-independence which was suppressed by Edward, and it then came under his direct rule. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death, and Nottingham did the same shortly afterwards. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for 918, \"all the people who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him\". This would mean that he ruled all England south of the Humber, but it is not clear whether Lincoln was an exception, as coins of Viking York in the early 920s were probably minted at Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=329\u201331}} Some Danish [[earl|jarls]] were allowed to keep their estates, although Edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land, and some he kept in his own hands. Coin evidence suggests that his authority was stronger in the East Midlands than in East Anglia.{{sfnm|1a1=Abrams|1y=2001|1pp=138\u201339|2a1=Lyon|2y=2001|2p=74}} Three Welsh kings, [[Hywel Dda]], Clydog and [[Idwal Foel]], who had previously been subject to \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, now gave their allegiance to Edward.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2013|pp=484, 498\u2013500}}\n[[File:Early-Medieval coin , Penny of Edward the Elder (FindID 223825).jpg|thumb|Penny of Edward the Elder|alt=Penny of Edward the Elder]]\n\n==Coinage==\nThe principal currency in later Anglo-Saxon England was the [[Penny (English coin)|silver penny]], and some coins carried a stylised portrait of the king. Edward's coins had \"EADVVEARD REX\" on the [[obverse]] and the name of the moneyer on the reverse. The places of issue were not shown in his reign, but they were in that of his son \u00c6thelstan, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Canterbury]], Chester, [[Chichester]], Derby, [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], London, Oxford, [[Shaftesbury]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Southampton]], [[Stafford]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of \u00c6thelred or \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor issue of coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, fewer than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around five in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the conquered Danelaw.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyon|1y=2001|1pp=67\u201373, 77|2a1=Blackburn|2y=2014}}\n\n==Church==\nIn 908, Plegmund conveyed the alms of the English king and people to the Pope, the first visit to Rome by an Archbishop of Canterbury for almost a century, and the journey may have been to seek papal approval for a proposed re-organisation of the West Saxon sees.{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=210, 213}} When Edward came to the throne Wessex had two dioceses, [[Diocese of Winchester|Winchester]], held by [[Denewulf]], and [[Diocese of Sherborne|Sherborne]], held by Asser.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|pp=230\u201331}} In 908 Denewulf died and was replaced the following year by [[Frithestan]]; soon afterwards Winchester was divided into two sees, with the creation of the [[diocese of Ramsbury]] covering Wiltshire and [[Berkshire]], while Winchester was left with [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. Forged charters date the division to 909, but this may not be correct. Asser died in the same year, and at some date between 909 and 918 Sherborne was divided into three sees, [[Diocese of Crediton|Crediton]] covering [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and [[diocese of Wells|Wells]] covering Somerset, leaving Sherborne with Dorset.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2004b|2a1=Brooks|2y=1984|2pp=212\u201313}} The effect of the changes was to strengthen the status of Canterbury compared with Winchester and Sherborne, but the division may have been related to a change in the secular functions of West Saxon bishops, to become agents of royal government in shires rather than provinces, assisting in defence and taking part in shire courts.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=243}}\n\nAt the beginning of Edward's reign, his mother Ealhswith founded the abbey of St Mary for nuns, known as the [[Nunnaminster]], in Winchester.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=231}} Edward's daughter [[Eadburh of Winchester|Eadburh]] became a nun there, and she was venerated as a saint and the subject of a hagiography by [[Osbert of Clare]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|pp=259\u201360}} In 901, Edward started building a major religious community for men, possibly in accordance with his father's wishes. The monastery was next to Winchester Cathedral, which became known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] while Edward's foundation was called the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]]. It was much larger than the Old Minster, and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=231\u201334|2a1=Marafioti|2y=2014|2pp=26\u201329}} It acquired relics of the Breton [[Saint Judoc]], which probably arrived in England from [[Ponthieu]] in 901, and the body of one of Alfred's closest advisers, [[Grimbald]], who died in the same year and who was soon venerated as a saint. Edward's mother died in 902, and he buried her and Alfred there, moving his father's body from the Old Minster. Burials in the early 920s included Edward himself, his brother \u00c6thelweard, and his son [[\u00c6lfweard of Wessex|\u00c6lfweard]]. On the other hand, when \u00c6thelstan became king in 924, he did not show any favour to his father's foundation, probably because Winchester sided against him when the throne was disputed after Edward's death. The only other king buried at the New Minster was [[Eadwig]], in 959.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2001|1pp=xxv\u2013xxix|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2pp=253\u201354}}\n\nEdward's decision not to expand the Old Minster, but rather to overshadow it with a much larger building, suggests animosity towards Bishop Denewulf, and this was compounded by forcing the Old Minster to cede both land for the new site, and an estate of 70 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] at [[Beddington]] to provide an income for the New Minster. Edward was remembered by the New Minster as a benefactor, but at the Old Minster as ''rex avidus'' (greedy king).{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=234\u201337, 244|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2p=254}} He may have built the new church because he did not think that the Old Minster was grand enough to be the royal mausoleum for kings of the Anglo-Saxons, not just the West Saxons like their predecessors.{{sfn|Marafioti|2014|pp=28\u201331}} Alan Thacker comments:\n:Edward's method of endowing New Minster was of a piece with his ecclesiastical policy in general. Like his father he gave little to the church \u2014 indeed, judging by the dearth of charters for much of his reign he seems to have given away little at all{{nbsp}}... More than any other, Edward's kingship seems to epitomise the new hard-nosed monarchy of Wessex, determined to exploit all its resources, lay and ecclesiastical, for its own benefit.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|p=254}} \n[[Patrick Wormald]] observes: \"The thought occurs that neither Alfred nor Edward was greatly beloved at Winchester Cathedral; and one reason for Edward's moving his father's body into the new family shrine next door was that he was surer of sincere prayers there.\"{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=274\u201375}}\n\n==Learning and culture==\nThe standard of Anglo-Saxon learning declined severely in the ninth century, particularly in Wessex, and Mercian scholars such as Plegmund played a major part in the revival of learning initiated by Alfred. Mercians were prominent at the courts of Alfred and Edward, and the Mercian dialect and scholarship commanded West Saxon respect.{{sfn|Gretsch|2001|p=287}} It is uncertain how far Alfred's programmes continued during his son's reign. English translations of works in Latin made during Alfred's reign continued to be copied, but few original works are known. The script known as Anglo-Saxon Square [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] reached maturity in the 930s, and its earliest phases date to Edward's reign. The main scholarly and scriptorial centres were the cathedral centres of Canterbury, Winchester and Worcester; monasteries did not make a significant contribution until \u00c6thelstan's reign.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|pp=12\u201316}} Very little survives of the manuscript production of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|p=2}}\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon art#Textile art|only surviving large scale embroideries]] which were certainly made in Anglo-Saxon England date to Edward's reign. They are a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], a maniple and a possible [[girdle]] removed from the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]] in [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nineteenth century. They were donated to the shrine by \u00c6thelstan in 934, but inscriptions on the embroideries show that they were commissioned by Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, as a gift to Frithestan, [[Bishop of Winchester]]. They probably did not reach their intended destination because \u00c6thelstan was on bad terms with Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Coatsworth|1y=2001|1pp=292\u201396|2a1=Wilson|2y=1984|2p=154}}\n\n==Law and administration==\nAlmost all surviving charters from Edward's reign are later copies, and the only surviving original is not a charter of Edward himself, but a grant by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in 901.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|p=13}} In the same year a meeting at Southampton was attended by his brother and sons, his household [[thegn]]s and nearly all bishops, but no ealdormen. It was on this occasion that the king acquired land from the Bishop of Winchester for the foundation of the New Minster, Winchester. No charters survive for the period from 910 to the king's death in 924, much to the puzzlement and distress of historians. Charters were usually issued when the king made grants of land, and it is possible that Edward followed a policy of retaining property which came into his hands to help finance his campaigns against the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=50\u201351, 55\u201356}} Charters rarely survive unless they concerned property which passed to the church and were preserved in their archives, and another possibility is that Edward was making grants of property only on terms which ensured that they returned to male members of the royal house; such charters would not be found in church archives.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=275}}\n\nClause 3 of the law code called ''I Edward'' provides that people convincingly charged with perjury shall not be allowed to clear themselves by oath, but only by [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]]. This is the start of the continuous history in England of [[trial by ordeal]]; it is probably mentioned in the laws of King [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] (688 to 726),{{efn|It is not certain that the references in Ine's laws are to trial by ordeal.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=14}} }} but not in later codes such as those of Alfred.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=14}} The administrative and legal system in Edward's reign may have depended extensively on written records, almost none of which survive.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=23}} Edward was one of the few Anglo-Saxon kings to issue laws about bookland. There was increasing confusion in the period as to what was really bookland; Edward urged prompt settlement in bookland and folkland disputes, and his legislation established that jurisdiction belonged to the king and his officers.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=264, 276}}\n\n==Later life==\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', there was a general submission of rulers in Britain to Edward in 920:\n:Then [Edward] went from there into the [[Peak District]] to [[Bakewell]] and ordered a borough to be built in the neighbourhood and manned. And then the king of the Scots and all the people of the Scots, and [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|R\u00e6gnald]] and the sons of [[Eadwulf II of Northumbria|Eadwulf]]{{efn|R\u00e6gnald was the Norse Viking king of York in southern Northumbria, and Eadwulf was the Anglo-Saxon ruler of northern Northumbria, which was not conquered by the Vikings.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|p=205}} }} and all who live in Northumbria, both English and Danish, Norsemen and others, and also the king of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] Welsh and all the Strathclyde Welsh, chose him as father and lord.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=200\u201301}}\nThis passage was regarded as a straightforward report by most historians until the late twentieth century,{{sfn|Davidson|2001|p=201}} and [[Frank Stenton]] observed that \"each of the rulers named in this list had something definite to gain from an acknowledgement of Edward's overlordship\".{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=334}} Since the 1980s this submission has been viewed with increasing scepticism, particularly as the passage in the ''Chronicle'' is the only evidence for it, unlike other submissions such as that one in 927 to \u00c6thelstan, for which there is independent support from literary sources and coins.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206\u201307}} [[Alfred P. Smyth]] points out that Edward was not in a position to impose the same conditions on the Scots and the Northumbrians as he could on conquered Vikings, and argues that the ''Chronicle'' presented a treaty between kings as a submission to Wessex.{{sfn|Smyth|1984|p=199}} Stafford observes that the rulers had met at [[Bakewell]] on the border between Mercia and Northumbria, and that meetings on borders were generally considered to avoid any implication of submission by either side.{{sfn|Stafford|1989|p=33}} Davidson points out that the wording \"chosen as father and lord\" applied to conquered army groups and burhs, not relations with other kings. In his view:\n:The idea that this meeting represented a 'submission', while it must remain a possibility, does however seem unlikely. The textual context of the chronicler's passage makes his interpretation of the meeting suspect, and ultimately, Edward was in no position to force the subordination of, or dictate terms to, his fellow kings in Britain.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206, 209}}\n\nEdward continued \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's policy of founding burhs in the north-west, at [[Thelwall]] and [[Manchester]] in 919, and ''Cledematha'' ([[Rhuddlan]]) at the mouth of the [[River Clwyd]] in North Wales in 921.{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=168}}\n\nNothing is known of his relations with the Mercians between 919 and the last year of his life, when he put down a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester. Mercia and the eastern Danelaw were organised into shires at an unknown date in the tenth century, ignoring traditional boundaries, and historians such as Sean Miller and David Griffiths suggest that Edward's imposition of direct control from 919 is a likely context for a change which ignored Mercian sensibilities. Resentment at the changes, at the imposition of rule by distant Wessex, and at fiscal demands by Edward's reeves, may have provoked the revolt at Chester. He died at the royal estate of Farndon, twelve miles south of Chester, on 24 July 924, shortly after putting down the revolt, and was buried in the New Minster, Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Griffiths|2y=2001|2pp=167, 182\u201383}} In 1109, the New Minster was moved outside the city walls to become [[Hyde Abbey]], and the following year the remains of Edward and his parents were translated to the new church.{{sfn|Doubleday|Page|1903|pp=116\u201322}}\n\n==Reputation==\nAccording to William of Malmesbury, Edward was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\", but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". Other medieval chroniclers expressed similar views, and he was generally seen as inferior in book learning, but superior in military success. [[John of Worcester]] described him as \"the most invincible King Edward the Elder\". However, even as war leader he was only one of a succession of successful kings; his achievements were overshadowed because he did not have a famous victory like Alfred's at Edington and \u00c6thelstan's at [[Battle of Brunanburh|Brunanburh]], and William of Malmesbury qualified his praise of Edward by saying that \"the chief prize of victory, in my judgment, is due to his father\".{{efn|All quotations in this paragraph are from Higham, 'Edward the Elder's Reputation: An Introduction', pp. 2-3}} Edward has also been overshadowed by chroniclers' admiration for his highly regarded sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d.{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=2\u20134|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2pp=40\u201341}}\n\nA principal reason for the neglect of Edward is that very few primary sources for his reign survive, whereas there are many for Alfred. He was largely ignored by historians until the late twentieth century, but he is now highly regarded. He is described by Keynes as \"far more than the bellicose bit between Alfred and \u00c6thelstan\",{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=3\u20139|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=57}} and according to Nick Higham: \"Edward the Elder is perhaps the most neglected of English kings. He ruled an expanding realm for twenty-five years and arguably did as much as any other individual to construct a single, south-centred, Anglo-Saxon kingdom, yet posthumously his achievements have been all but forgotten.\" In 1999 a conference on his reign was held at the [[University of Manchester]], and the papers given on this occasion were published as a book in 2001. Prior to this conference, no monographs had been published on Edward's reign, whereas his father has been the subject of numerous biographies and other studies.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|pp=1\u20134}}\n\nIn the view of F. T. Wainwright: \"Without detracting from the achievements of Alfred, it is well to remember that it was Edward who reconquered the Danish Midlands and gave England nearly a century of respite from serious Danish attacks.\"{{sfn|Wainwright|1975|p= 77}} Higham summarises Edward's legacy as follows:\n:Under Edward's leadership, the scale of alternative centres of power diminished markedly: the separate court of Mercia was dissolved; the Danish leaders were in large part brought to heel or expelled; the Welsh princes were constrained from aggression of the borders and even the West Saxon bishoprics divided. Late Anglo-Saxon England is often described as the most centralised polity in western Europe at the time, with its shires, its shire-reeves and its systems of regional courts and royal taxation. If so \u2014 and the matter remains debatable \u2014 much of that centrality derives from Edward's activities, and he has as good a claim as any other to be considered the architect of medieval England.{{sfn|Higham|2001b|p=311}}\n\nEdward's [[cognomen]] 'the Elder' was first used in [[Wulfstan the Cantor|Wulfstan]]'s ''Life of St \u00c6thelwold'' at the end of the tenth century, to distinguish him from King [[Edward the Martyr]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n\n==Marriages and children==\nEdward had about fourteen children from three marriages.{{efn| The order in which Edward's children are listed is based on the family tree in Foot's ''\u00c6thelstan: the First King of England'', which shows sons of each wife before daughters.

He was the elder son of [[Alfred the Great]] and his wife [[Ealhswith]]. When Edward succeeded to the throne, he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin [[\u00c6thelwold \u00e6theling|\u00c6thelwold]], who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, [[\u00c6thelred I, King of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].\n\nAlfred had succeeded \u00c6thelred as king of [[Wessex]] in 871, and almost faced defeat against the Danish [[Viking]]s until his decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and eastern [[Mercia]], leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and married his daughter [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], and around 886 Alfred adopted the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule.\n\nIn 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army, ending the threat from the northern Vikings. In the 910s, Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who had succeeded as Lady of the Mercians following the death of her husband in 911. Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period, and after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in June 918, her daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], briefly became second Lady of the Mercians, but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct rule on Mercia. By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at [[Chester]], and after putting it down he died at [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]] in [[Cheshire]] on 17 July 924. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[\u00c6thelstan]].\n\nEdward was admired by medieval chroniclers, and in the view of [[William of Malmesbury]], he was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\" but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and [[Nick Higham (historian)|Nick Higham]] described him as \"perhaps the most neglected of English kings\", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom.\n\n==Background==\n[[Mercia]] was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by [[Wessex]] at the [[Battle of Ellandun]] in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|pp=11\u201312}} In 865 the Danish Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to pay off the Vikings, who invaded [[Northumbria]] the following year. They appointed a puppet king in 867, and then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867\u2013868. King [[Burgred]] of Mercia was joined by King [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex]] and his brother, the future [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]], for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Danes conquered East Anglia, and in 874 they expelled King Burgred and, with their support, [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]] became the last King of Mercia. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. In early 878 they invaded Wessex, and many West Saxons submitted to them. Alfred, who was now king, was reduced to a remote base in the [[Isle of Athelney]] in [[Somerset]], but the situation was transformed when he won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]]. He was thus able to prevent the Vikings from taking Wessex and western Mercia, although they still occupied Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=245\u201357}}\n\n==Childhood==\n[[File:Will of Alfred the Great (New Minster Liber Vitae) - BL Stowe MS 944, f 30v.jpg|thumb|A page from the will of Alfred the Great, which left the bulk of his estate to Edward]]\nEdward's parents, Alfred and [[Ealhswith]], married in 868. Her father was [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]], and her mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family. Alfred and Ealhswith had five children who survived childhood. The oldest was [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], who married [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], and ruled as Lady of the Mercians after his death. Edward was next, and the second daughter, [[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]], became [[Shaftesbury Abbey|abbess of Shaftesbury]]. The third daughter, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]], married [[Baldwin II, Margrave of Flanders|Baldwin, Count of Flanders]], and the younger son, [[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]], was given a scholarly education, including learning Latin. This would usually suggest that he was intended for the church, but it is unlikely in \u00c6thelweard's case as he later had sons. There were also an unknown number of children who died young. Neither part of Edward's name, which means 'protector of wealth', had been used previously by the West Saxon royal house, and [[Barbara Yorke]] suggests that he may have been named after his maternal grandmother Eadburh, reflecting the West Saxon policy of strengthening links with Mercia.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25\u201328}}\n\nHistorians estimate that Edward was probably born in the mid-870s. His eldest sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, was probably born about a year after her parents' marriage, and Edward was brought up with his youngest sister, \u00c6lfthryth; Yorke argues that he was therefore probably nearer in age to \u00c6lfthryth than \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. Edward led troops in battle in 893, and must have been of marriageable age in that year as his oldest son \u00c6thelstan was born about 894.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=25\u201326|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} According to [[Asser]] in his ''Life of King Alfred'', Edward and \u00c6lfthryth were educated at court by male and female tutors, and read ecclesiastical and secular works in English, such as the [[Psalms]] and [[Old English poetry|Old English poems]]. They were taught the courtly qualities of gentleness and humility, and Asser wrote that they were obedient to their father and friendly to visitors. This is the only known case of an Anglo-Saxon prince and princess receiving the same upbringing.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==\u00c6theling==\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAs a son of a king, Edward was an [[\u00e6theling]], a prince of the royal house who was eligible for kingship. Even though he had the advantage of being the eldest son of the reigning king, his accession was not assured as he had cousins who had a strong claim to the throne. [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]] were sons of \u00c6thelred, Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, but they had been passed over because they were infants when their father died. Asser gives more information about Edward's childhood and youth than is known about other Anglo-Saxon princes, providing details about the training of a prince in a period of [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] influence, and Yorke suggest that we may know so much due to Alfred's efforts to portray his son as the most throneworthy \u00e6theling.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25, 29\u201330}}\n\n\u00c6thelhelm is only recorded in Alfred's will of the mid-880s, and probably died at some time in the next decade, but \u00c6thelwold is listed above Edward in the only [[charter]] where he appears, probably indicating a higher status. \u00c6thelwold may also have had an advantage because his mother Wulfthryth witnessed a charter as queen, whereas Edward's mother Ealhswith never had a higher status than king's wife.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00c6thelhelm|1y= PASE |2a1=S 356|2y=Sawyer|3a1=Yorke|3y=2001|3p=31}} However, Alfred was in a position to give his own son considerable advantages. In his will, he left only a handful of estates to his brother's sons, and the bulk of his property to Edward, including all his [[Bookland (law)|booklands]] (land vested in a charter which could be alienated by the holder, as opposed to folkland, which had to pass to [[heirs of the body]]) in [[Kent]].{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes and Lapidge|1y=1983|1pp=175\u201376, 321\u201322|2a1=Yorke|2y=2001|2p=30}} Alfred also advanced men who could be depended on to support his plans for his succession, such as his brother-in-law, a Mercian ealdorman called \u00c6thelwulf, and his son-in-law \u00c6thelred. Edward witnessed several of his father's charters, and often accompanied him on royal peregrinations.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201335}} In a Kentish charter of 898 Edward witnessed as ''rex Saxonum'', suggesting that Alfred may have followed the strategy adopted by his grandfather [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] of strengthening his son's claim to succeed to the West Saxon throne by making him sub-king of Kent.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=32}}\n\nOnce Edward grew up, Alfred was able to give him military commands and experience in royal administration.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201332}} The English defeated renewed Viking attacks in 893 to 896, and in [[Richard Abels]]' view, the glory belonged to \u00c6thelred and Edward rather than Alfred himself. In 893 Edward defeated the Vikings in the Battle of Farnham, although he was unable to follow up his victory as his troops' period of service had expired and he had to release them. The situation was saved by the arrival of troops from London led by \u00c6thelred.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=294\u2013304}} Yorke argues that although Alfred packed the [[witan]] with members whose interests lay in the continuation of Alfred's line, that may not have been sufficient to ensure Edward's accession if he had not displayed his fitness for kingship.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=37}}\n\nIn about 893, Edward probably married [[Ecgwynn]], who bore him two children, the future King \u00c6thelstan and a daughter who married [[Sitric C\u00e1ech]], a Viking King of York. The twelfth-century chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] described Ecgwynn as an ''illustris femina'' (noble lady), and stated that Edward chose \u00c6thelstan as his heir as king. She may have been related to St [[Dunstan]], the aristocratic tenth-century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. But William of Malmesbury also stated that \u00c6thelstan's accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Bailey|2y=2001|2p=114|3a1=Mynors, Thomson and Winterbottom|3y=1998|3p=199}} The suggestion that Ecgwynn was Edward's mistress is accepted by some historians such as [[Simon Keynes]] and Richard Abels,{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=1999|1p=467|2a1=Abels|2y=1998|2p=307}} but Yorke and \u00c6thelstan's biographer, [[Sarah Foot]], disagree, arguing that the allegations should be seen in the context of the disputed succession in 924, and were not an issue in the 890s.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1p=33|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=31}} Ecgwynn probably died by 899, as around the time of Alfred's death Edward married [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], the daughter of Ealdorman \u00c6thelhelm, probably of [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=33}}\n\n[[Janet Nelson]] suggests that there was conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s. She points out that the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', produced under court auspices in the 890s, does not mention Edward's military successes. These are known only from the late tenth century chronicle of [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], such as his account of the Battle of Farnham, in which in Nelson's view \"Edward's military prowess, and popularity with a following of young warriors, are highlighted\". Towards the end of his life Alfred invested his young grandson \u00c6thelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to the kingship. Nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by Edward to support the accession of his own son, on the other hand it may have been intended by Alfred as part of a scheme to divide the kingdom between his son and grandson. \u00c6thelstan was sent to be brought up in Mercia by \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and \u00c6thelred, but it is not known whether this was Alfred's idea or Edward's. Alfred's wife Ealhswith was ignored in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' in her husband's lifetime, but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded. This may be because she supported her son against her husband.{{sfn|Nelson|1996| pp= 53\u201354, 63\u201366}}\n\n==\u00c6thelwold's revolt==\n{{further|\u00c6thelwold's Revolt}}\n[[File:Coin of King Edward the Elder.JPG|thumb|240px|Coin of Edward the Elder]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 and Edward succeeded to the throne, but \u00c6thelwold disputed the succession.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He seized the royal estates of [[Wimborne]], symbolically important as the place where his father was buried, and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], both in [[Dorset]]. Edward marched with his army to the nearby [[Iron Age]] hillfort at [[Badbury Rings]]. \u00c6thelwold declared that he would live or die at Wimborne, but then left in the night and rode to Northumbria, where the Danes accepted him as king.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=321|2a1=Lavelle|2y=2009|2pp=53, 61}} Edward was crowned on 8{{nbsp}}June 900 at [[Kingston upon Thames]].{{efn|The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph of Diceto]] stated that the coronation took place at Kingston, and this is accepted by [[Simon Keynes]], although [[Sarah Foot]] says that \"Edward might well have held the ceremony at Winchester\".{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=2001| 1p= 48|2a1= Foot|2y=2011| 2p= 74, n. 46}}}}\n\nIn 901, \u00c6thelwold came with a fleet to [[Essex]], and the following year he persuaded the East Anglian Danes to invade English Mercia and northern Wessex, where his army looted and then returned home. Edward retaliated by ravaging East Anglia, but when he retreated the men of Kent disobeyed the order to retire, and were intercepted by the Danish army. The two sides met at the [[Battle of the Holme]] (perhaps [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme]] in [[Huntingdonshire]]) on 13 December 902. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', the Danes \"kept the place of slaughter\", meaning that they won the battle, but they suffered heavy losses, including \u00c6thelwold and a King Eohric, possibly of the East Anglian Danes. Kentish losses included Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent and father of Edward's third wife, Eadgifu. \u00c6thelwold's death ended the threat to Edward's throne.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1pp=321\u2013322|2a1=Hart|2y=1992|2pp=512\u201315|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}}\n\n==King of the Anglo-Saxons==\nIn London in 886 Alfred had received the formal submission of \"all the English people that were not under subjection to the Danes\", and thereafter he adopted the title ''Anglorum Saxonum rex'' (King of the Anglo-Saxons), which is used in his later charters and all but two of Edward's. This is seen by Keynes as \"the invention of a wholly new and distinctive polity\", covering both West Saxons and Mercians, which was inherited by Edward with the support of Mercians at the West Saxon court, of whom the most important was [[Plegmund]], Archbishop of Canterbury. In 903 Edward issued several charters concerning land in Mercia. Three of them are witnessed by the Mercian leaders and their daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], and they all contain a statement that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d \"then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians, under the aforesaid king\". Other charters were issued by the Mercian leaders which did not contain any acknowledgment of Edward's authority, but they did not issue their own coinage.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=44\u201358}} This view of Edward's status is accepted by Martin Ryan, who states that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had \"a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority\" in English Mercia.{{sfn|Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nOther historians disagree. [[Pauline Stafford]] describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\",{{sfn|Stafford|2001|p=45}} while in Charles Insley's view Mercia kept its independence until \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in 918.{{sfn|Insley|2009|p=330}} Michael Davidson contrasts the 903 charters with one of 901 in which the Mercian rulers were \"by grace of God, holding, governing and defending the monarchy of the Mercians\". Davidson comments that \"the evidence for Mercian subordination is decidedly mixed. Ultimately, the ideology of the 'Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons' may have been less successful in achieving the absorption of Mercia and more something which I would see as a murky political coup.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' was compiled at the West Saxon court from the 890s, and the entries for the late ninth and early tenth centuries are seen by historians as reflecting the West Saxon viewpoint; Davidson observes that \"Alfred and Edward possessed skilled 'spin doctors'\".{{sfnm|1a1=Davidson|1y=2001|1pp=203\u201305|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=43}} Some versions of the ''Chronicle'' incorporate part of a lost ''Mercian Register'', which gives a Mercian perspective and details of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's campaign against the Vikings.{{sfn |Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries, connection by marriage with the West Saxon royal house was seen as prestigious by continental rulers. In the mid-890s Alfred had married his daughter \u00c6lfthryth to Baldwin II of Flanders, and in 919 Edward married his daughter [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]] to [[Charles the Simple]], King of [[West Francia]]. In 925, after Edward's death, another daughter [[Eadgyth]] married [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], the future [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]] and (after Eadgyth's death) [[Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Sharp|2001|pp=81\u201386}}\n\n==Conquest of the southern Danelaw==\nNo battles are recorded between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danish Vikings for several years after the [[Battle of the Holme]], but in 906 Edward agreed peace with the East Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, suggesting that there had been conflict. According to one version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' he made peace \"of necessity\", which implies that he was forced to buy them off.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He encouraged Englishmen to purchase land in Danish territory, and two charters survive relating to estates in [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Derbyshire]].{{sfn|Abrams|2001|p=136}} In 909 Edward sent a combined West Saxon and Mercian army which harassed the Northumbrian Danes, and seized the bones of the Northumbrian royal saint [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] from [[Bardney Abbey]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. Oswald was [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|a new Mercian minster]] established by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in [[Gloucester]] and the Danes were compelled to accept peace on Edward's terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=323|2a1=Heighway|2y=2001|2p=108}} In the following year, the Northumbrian Danes retaliated by raiding Mercia, but on their way home they were met by a combined Mercian and West Saxon army at the [[Battle of Tettenhall]], where the Vikings suffered a disastrous defeat. After that, the Northumbrian Danes never ventured south of the River [[Humber]], and Edward and his Mercian allies were able to concentrate on conquering the southern Danelaw in East Anglia and the [[Five Boroughs]] of Viking east Mercia: [[Derby]], [[Leicester]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}} \n\nIn 911 \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, died, and Edward took control of the Mercian lands around London and [[Oxford]]. \u00c6thelred was succeeded as ruler by his widow \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as Lady of the Mercians, and she had probably been acting as ruler for several years as \u00c6thelred seems to have been incapacitated in later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=324, n. 1|2a1=Wainwright|2y=1975|2pp=308\u201309|3a1=Bailey|3y=2001|3p=113}}\n\nEdward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d then began the construction of fortresses to guard against Viking attacks and protect territory captured from them. In November 911, he constructed a fort on the north bank of the [[River Lea]] at [[Hertford]] to guard against attack by the Danes of [[Bedford]] and [[Cambridge]]. In 912, he marched with his army to [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex, and ordered the building of a fort at [[Witham]] and a second fort at Hertford, which protected London from attack and encouraged many English living under Danish rule in Essex to submit to him. In 913 there was a pause in his activities, although \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d continued her fortress building in Mercia.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=324\u201325}} \n\nIn 914, a Viking army sailed from [[Brittany]] and ravaged the [[Severn]] estuary. It then attacked [[Ergyng]] in south-east Wales (now [[Archenfield]] in [[Herefordshire]]) and captured the Bishop, referred to as Cameleac, Cimeliauc and Cyfeilliog, depending on the source. Edward ransomed him for the large sum of forty pounds of silver. The Vikings were defeated in 915 by the armies of Hereford and Gloucester, and gave hostages and oaths to keep the peace. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', one of the two jarls who had led the raids, Hroald, was killed, as was the brother of the other jarl.<ref>Worcester Manuscript, p. 99, quoted in {{cite web |url=https://htt.herefordshire.gov.uk/herefordshires-past/the-anglo-saxon-period/the-vikings/the-vikings-in-herefordshire/ |title=The Vikings in Herefordshire |date=2005|last=Greene|first=Miranda |publisher=Herefordshire Council |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nEdward maintained an army on the south side of the estuary in case the Vikings broke their promises, and he twice had to repel attacks. In the autumn the Vikings moved on to Ireland. The episode suggests that south-east Wales fell within the West Saxon sphere of power, unlike [[Brycheiniog]] just to the north, where Mercia was dominant.{{sfnm|1a1=Charles-Edwards|1y=2013|1p=506|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} In late 914 Edward built two forts at [[Buckingham]], and Earl Thurketil, the leader of the Danish army at Bedford submitted to him. The following year he occupied Bedford, and constructed another fortification on the south bank of the [[River Great Ouse]] against a Viking one on the north bank. In 916 Edward returned to Essex and built a fort at Maldon to bolster the defence of Witham. He also helped Earl Thurketil and his followers to leave England, reducing the number of Viking armies in the Midlands.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=325\u201326}}\n\nThe decisive year in the war was 917. In April Edward built a fort at [[Towcester]] as a defence against the Danes of [[Northampton]], and another at an unidentified place called Wigingamere. The Danes launched unsuccessful attacks on Towcester, Bedford and Wigingamere, while \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d captured Derby, showing the value of the English defensive measures, which were aided by disunity and a lack of coordination among the Viking armies. The Danes had built their own fortress at [[Tempsford]] in Bedfordshire, but at the end of the summer the English stormed it and killed the last Danish king of East Anglia. The English then took [[Colchester]], although they did not try to hold it. The Danes retaliated by sending a large army to lay siege to Maldon, but the garrison held out until it was relieved and the retreating army was heavily defeated. Edward then returned to Towcester and reinforced its fort with a stone wall, and the Danes of nearby Northampton submitted to him. The armies of Cambridge and East Anglia also submitted, and by the end of the year the only Danish armies still holding out were those of four of the Five Boroughs, Leicester, Stamford, Nottingham, and Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=327\u201329}}\n\nIn early 918, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d secured the submission of Leicester without a fight, and the Danes of Northumbrian York offered her their allegiance, probably for protection against [[Norwegians#Viking Age|Norse]] (Norwegian) Vikings who had invaded Northumbria from Ireland, but she died on 12 June before she could take up the proposal. The same offer is not known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. According to the main West Saxon version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death the Mercians submitted to Edward, but the Mercian version (the ''Mercian Register'') states that in December 918 her daughter \u00c6lfwynn \"was deprived of all authority in Mercia and taken into Wessex\". Mercia may have made a bid for continued semi-independence which was suppressed by Edward, and it then came under his direct rule. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death, and Nottingham did the same shortly afterwards. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for 918, \"all the people who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him\". This would mean that he ruled all England south of the Humber, but it is not clear whether Lincoln was an exception, as coins of Viking York in the early 920s were probably minted at Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=329\u201331}} Some Danish [[earl|jarls]] were allowed to keep their estates, although Edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land, and some he kept in his own hands.

Edward's coins had \"EADVVEARD REX\" on the [[obverse]] and the name of the moneyer on the reverse. The places of issue were not shown in his reign, but they were in that of his son \u00c6thelstan, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Canterbury]], Chester, [[Chichester]], Derby, [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], London, Oxford, [[Shaftesbury]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Southampton]], [[Stafford]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of \u00c6thelred or \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor issue of coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, fewer than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around five in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the conquered Danelaw.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyon|1y=2001|1pp=67\u201373, 77|2a1=Blackburn|2y=2014}}\n\n==Church==\nIn 908, Plegmund conveyed the alms of the English king and people to the Pope, the first visit to Rome by an Archbishop of Canterbury for almost a century, and the journey may have been to seek papal approval for a proposed re-organisation of the West Saxon sees.{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=210, 213}} When Edward came to the throne Wessex had two dioceses, [[Diocese of Winchester|Winchester]], held by [[Denewulf]], and [[Diocese of Sherborne|Sherborne]], held by Asser.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|pp=230\u201331}} In 908 Denewulf died and was replaced the following year by [[Frithestan]]; soon afterwards Winchester was divided into two sees, with the creation of the [[diocese of Ramsbury]] covering Wiltshire and [[Berkshire]], while Winchester was left with [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. Forged charters date the division to 909, but this may not be correct. Asser died in the same year, and at some date between 909 and 918 Sherborne was divided into three sees, [[Diocese of Crediton|Crediton]] covering [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and [[diocese of Wells|Wells]] covering Somerset, leaving Sherborne with Dorset.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2004b|2a1=Brooks|2y=1984|2pp=212\u201313}} The effect of the changes was to strengthen the status of Canterbury compared with Winchester and Sherborne, but the division may have been related to a change in the secular functions of West Saxon bishops, to become agents of royal government in shires rather than provinces, assisting in defence and taking part in shire courts.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=243}}\n\nAt the beginning of Edward's reign, his mother Ealhswith founded the abbey of St Mary for nuns, known as the [[Nunnaminster]], in Winchester.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=231}} Edward's daughter [[Eadburh of Winchester|Eadburh]] became a nun there, and she was venerated as a saint and the subject of a hagiography by [[Osbert of Clare]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|pp=259\u201360}} In 901, Edward started building a major religious community for men, possibly in accordance with his father's wishes. The monastery was next to Winchester Cathedral, which became known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] while Edward's foundation was called the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]]. It was much larger than the Old Minster, and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=231\u201334|2a1=Marafioti|2y=2014|2pp=26\u201329}} It acquired relics of the Breton [[Saint Judoc]], which probably arrived in England from [[Ponthieu]] in 901, and the body of one of Alfred's closest advisers, [[Grimbald]], who died in the same year and who was soon venerated as a saint. Edward's mother died in 902, and he buried her and Alfred there, moving his father's body from the Old Minster. Burials in the early 920s included Edward himself, his brother \u00c6thelweard, and his son [[\u00c6lfweard of Wessex|\u00c6lfweard]]. On the other hand, when \u00c6thelstan became king in 924, he did not show any favour to his father's foundation, probably because Winchester sided against him when the throne was disputed after Edward's death. The only other king buried at the New Minster was [[Eadwig]], in 959.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2001|1pp=xxv\u2013xxix|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2pp=253\u201354}}\n\nEdward's decision not to expand the Old Minster, but rather to overshadow it with a much larger building, suggests animosity towards Bishop Denewulf, and this was compounded by forcing the Old Minster to cede both land for the new site, and an estate of 70 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] at [[Beddington]] to provide an income for the New Minster. Edward was remembered by the New Minster as a benefactor, but at the Old Minster as ''rex avidus'' (greedy king).{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=234\u201337, 244|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2p=254}} He may have built the new church because he did not think that the Old Minster was grand enough to be the royal mausoleum for kings of the Anglo-Saxons, not just the West Saxons like their predecessors.{{sfn|Marafioti|2014|pp=28\u201331}} Alan Thacker comments:\n:Edward's method of endowing New Minster was of a piece with his ecclesiastical policy in general. Like his father he gave little to the church \u2014 indeed, judging by the dearth of charters for much of his reign he seems to have given away little at all{{nbsp}}... More than any other, Edward's kingship seems to epitomise the new hard-nosed monarchy of Wessex, determined to exploit all its resources, lay and ecclesiastical, for its own benefit.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|p=254}} \n[[Patrick Wormald]] observes: \"The thought occurs that neither Alfred nor Edward was greatly beloved at Winchester Cathedral; and one reason for Edward's moving his father's body into the new family shrine next door was that he was surer of sincere prayers there.\"{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=274\u201375}}\n\n==Learning and culture==\nThe standard of Anglo-Saxon learning declined severely in the ninth century, particularly in Wessex, and Mercian scholars such as Plegmund played a major part in the revival of learning initiated by Alfred. Mercians were prominent at the courts of Alfred and Edward, and the Mercian dialect and scholarship commanded West Saxon respect.{{sfn|Gretsch|2001|p=287}} It is uncertain how far Alfred's programmes continued during his son's reign. English translations of works in Latin made during Alfred's reign continued to be copied, but few original works are known. The script known as Anglo-Saxon Square [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] reached maturity in the 930s, and its earliest phases date to Edward's reign. The main scholarly and scriptorial centres were the cathedral centres of Canterbury, Winchester and Worcester; monasteries did not make a significant contribution until \u00c6thelstan's reign.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|pp=12\u201316}} Very little survives of the manuscript production of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|p=2}}\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon art#Textile art|only surviving large scale embroideries]] which were certainly made in Anglo-Saxon England date to Edward's reign. They are a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], a maniple and a possible [[girdle]] removed from the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]] in [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nineteenth century. They were donated to the shrine by \u00c6thelstan in 934, but inscriptions on the embroideries show that they were commissioned by Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, as a gift to Frithestan, [[Bishop of Winchester]]. They probably did not reach their intended destination because \u00c6thelstan was on bad terms with Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Coatsworth|1y=2001|1pp=292\u201396|2a1=Wilson|2y=1984|2p=154}}\n\n==Law and administration==\nAlmost all surviving charters from Edward's reign are later copies, and the only surviving original is not a charter of Edward himself, but a grant by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in 901.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|p=13}} In the same year a meeting at Southampton was attended by his brother and sons, his household [[thegn]]s and nearly all bishops, but no ealdormen. It was on this occasion that the king acquired land from the Bishop of Winchester for the foundation of the New Minster, Winchester. No charters survive for the period from 910 to the king's death in 924, much to the puzzlement and distress of historians. Charters were usually issued when the king made grants of land, and it is possible that Edward followed a policy of retaining property which came into his hands to help finance his campaigns against the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=50\u201351, 55\u201356}} Charters rarely survive unless they concerned property which passed to the church and were preserved in their archives, and another possibility is that Edward was making grants of property only on terms which ensured that they returned to male members of the royal house; such charters would not be found in church archives.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=275}}\n\nClause 3 of the law code called ''I Edward'' provides that people convincingly charged with perjury shall not be allowed to clear themselves by oath, but only by [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]]. This is the start of the continuous history in England of [[trial by ordeal]]; it is probably mentioned in the laws of King [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] (688 to 726),{{efn|It is not certain that the references in Ine's laws are to trial by ordeal.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=14}} }} but not in later codes such as those of Alfred.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=14}} The administrative and legal system in Edward's reign may have depended extensively on written records, almost none of which survive.{{sfn|Campbell|2001|p=23}} Edward was one of the few Anglo-Saxon kings to issue laws about bookland. There was increasing confusion in the period as to what was really bookland; Edward urged prompt settlement in bookland and folkland disputes, and his legislation established that jurisdiction belonged to the king and his officers.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=264, 276}}\n\n==Later life==\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', there was a general submission of rulers in Britain to Edward in 920:\n:Then [Edward] went from there into the [[Peak District]] to [[Bakewell]] and ordered a borough to be built in the neighbourhood and manned. And then the king of the Scots and all the people of the Scots, and [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|R\u00e6gnald]] and the sons of [[Eadwulf II of Northumbria|Eadwulf]]{{efn|R\u00e6gnald was the Norse Viking king of York in southern Northumbria, and Eadwulf was the Anglo-Saxon ruler of northern Northumbria, which was not conquered by the Vikings.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|p=205}} }} and all who live in Northumbria, both English and Danish, Norsemen and others, and also the king of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] Welsh and all the Strathclyde Welsh, chose him as father and lord.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=200\u201301}}\nThis passage was regarded as a straightforward report by most historians until the late twentieth century,{{sfn|Davidson|2001|p=201}} and [[Frank Stenton]] observed that \"each of the rulers named in this list had something definite to gain from an acknowledgement of Edward's overlordship\".{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=334}} Since the 1980s this submission has been viewed with increasing scepticism, particularly as the passage in the ''Chronicle'' is the only evidence for it, unlike other submissions such as that one in 927 to \u00c6thelstan, for which there is independent support from literary sources and coins.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206\u201307}} [[Alfred P. Smyth]] points out that Edward was not in a position to impose the same conditions on the Scots and the Northumbrians as he could on conquered Vikings, and argues that the ''Chronicle'' presented a treaty between kings as a submission to Wessex.{{sfn|Smyth|1984|p=199}} Stafford observes that the rulers had met at [[Bakewell]] on the border between Mercia and Northumbria, and that meetings on borders were generally considered to avoid any implication of submission by either side.{{sfn|Stafford|1989|p=33}} Davidson points out that the wording \"chosen as father and lord\" applied to conquered army groups and burhs, not relations with other kings. In his view:\n:The idea that this meeting represented a 'submission', while it must remain a possibility, does however seem unlikely. The textual context of the chronicler's passage makes his interpretation of the meeting suspect, and ultimately, Edward was in no position to force the subordination of, or dictate terms to, his fellow kings in Britain.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206, 209}}\n\nEdward continued \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's policy of founding burhs in the north-west, at [[Thelwall]] and [[Manchester]] in 919, and ''Cledematha'' ([[Rhuddlan]]) at the mouth of the [[River Clwyd]] in North Wales in 921.{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=168}}\n\nNothing is known of his relations with the Mercians between 919 and the last year of his life, when he put down a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester. Mercia and the eastern Danelaw were organised into shires at an unknown date in the tenth century, ignoring traditional boundaries, and historians such as Sean Miller and David Griffiths suggest that Edward's imposition of direct control from 919 is a likely context for a change which ignored Mercian sensibilities. Resentment at the changes, at the imposition of rule by distant Wessex, and at fiscal demands by Edward's reeves, may have provoked the revolt at Chester. He died at the royal estate of Farndon, twelve miles south of Chester, on 24 July 924, shortly after putting down the revolt, and was buried in the New Minster, Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Griffiths|2y=2001|2pp=167, 182\u201383}} In 1109, the New Minster was moved outside the city walls to become [[Hyde Abbey]], and the following year the remains of Edward and his parents were translated to the new church.{{sfn|Doubleday|Page|1903|pp=116\u201322}}\n\n==Reputation==\nAccording to William of Malmesbury, Edward was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\", but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". Other medieval chroniclers expressed similar views, and he was generally seen as inferior in book learning, but superior in military success. [[John of Worcester]] described him as \"the most invincible King Edward the Elder\". However, even as war leader he was only one of a succession of successful kings; his achievements were overshadowed because he did not have a famous victory like Alfred's at Edington and \u00c6thelstan's at [[Battle of Brunanburh|Brunanburh]], and William of Malmesbury qualified his praise of Edward by saying that \"the chief prize of victory, in my judgment, is due to his father\".{{efn|All quotations in this paragraph are from Higham, 'Edward the Elder's Reputation: An Introduction', pp. 2-3}} Edward has also been overshadowed by chroniclers' admiration for his highly regarded sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d.{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=2\u20134|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2pp=40\u201341}}\n\nA principal reason for the neglect of Edward is that very few primary sources for his reign survive, whereas there are many for Alfred. He was largely ignored by historians until the late twentieth century, but he is now highly regarded. He is described by Keynes as \"far more than the bellicose bit between Alfred and \u00c6thelstan\",{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=3\u20139|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=57}} and according to Nick Higham: \"Edward the Elder is perhaps the most neglected of English kings. He ruled an expanding realm for twenty-five years and arguably did as much as any other individual to construct a single, south-centred, Anglo-Saxon kingdom, yet posthumously his achievements have been all but forgotten.\" In 1999 a conference on his reign was held at the [[University of Manchester]], and the papers given on this occasion were published as a book in 2001. Prior to this conference, no monographs had been published on Edward's reign, whereas his father has been the subject of numerous biographies and other studies.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|pp=1\u20134}}\n\nIn the view of F. T. Wainwright: \"Without detracting from the achievements of Alfred, it is well to remember that it was Edward who reconquered the Danish Midlands and gave England nearly a century of respite from serious Danish attacks.\"{{sfn|Wainwright|1975|p= 77}} Higham summarises Edward's legacy as follows:\n:Under Edward's leadership, the scale of alternative centres of power diminished markedly: the separate court of Mercia was dissolved; the Danish leaders were in large part brought to heel or expelled; the Welsh princes were constrained from aggression of the borders and even the West Saxon bishoprics divided. Late Anglo-Saxon England is often described as the most centralised polity in western Europe at the time, with its shires, its shire-reeves and its systems of regional courts and royal taxation. If so \u2014 and the matter remains debatable \u2014 much of that centrality derives from Edward's activities, and he has as good a claim as any other to be considered the architect of medieval England.{{sfn|Higham|2001b|p=311}}\n\nEdward's [[cognomen]] 'the Elder' was first used in [[Wulfstan the Cantor|Wulfstan]]'s ''Life of St \u00c6thelwold'' at the end of the tenth century, to distinguish him from King [[Edward the Martyr]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n\n==Marriages and children==\nEdward had about fourteen children from three marriages.{{efn| The order in which Edward's children are listed is based on the family tree in Foot's ''\u00c6thelstan: the First King of England'', which shows sons of each wife before daughters. The daughters are listed in their birth order according to William of Malmesbury's ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]''.{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=xv}} The earliest primary sources do not distinguish whether Sihtric's wife was \u00c6thelstan's full or half sister, and a tradition recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century makes her a daughter of Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d. She is described as the daughter of Edward and Ecgwynn in William of Malmesbury's twelfth century Deeds of the English Kings, and Michael Wood's argument that this is partly based on a lost early life of \u00c6thelstan has been generally accepted.{{sfnm|1a1=Thacker|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2pp=251\u201358}} Modern historians follow William of Malmesbury's testimony in showing her as \u00c6thelstan's full sister.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1991|1pp=xxix, 123|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=xv|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}} William did not know her name, but some late sources name her as Edith or Eadgyth, an identification accepted by some historians.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Williams|2y=1991|2pp=xxix, 123}} She is also identified in late sources with saint Edith of Polesworth, a view accepted by Alan Thacker, but dismissed as \"dubious\" by Sarah Foot, who thinks that it is likely that she entered the cloister in widowhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Thacker|1y=2001|1pp=257\u201358|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=48|3a1=Foot|3y=2010|3p=243}}}}\n\nHe first married [[Ecgwynn]] around 893.{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=11}} Their children were:\n* [[\u00c6thelstan]], King of England 924\u2013939{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n* A daughter, perhaps called Edith, married [[Sihtric C\u00e1ech|Sihtric]], Viking King of York in 926, who died in 927.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]].

He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

|network=BBC |date=20 August 2008}}</ref> born 19 June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson has been a controversial figure in British journalism and politics. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]].

The aircraft took off from Addis Ababa at 08:38 [[East Africa Time|local time]] (05:38 [[coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) with 149 passengers and 8 crew on board.<ref name=National /> One minute into the flight, the first officer, acting on the instructions of the captain, reported a \"flight control\" problem to the control tower. Two minutes into the flight, the plane's [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]] system activated, pitching the plane into a dive toward the ground. The pilots struggled to control it and managed to prevent the nose from diving further, but the plane continued to lose altitude. The MCAS then activated again, dropping the nose even further down. The pilots then flipped a pair of switches to disable the electrical [[trim tab]] system, which also disabled the MCAS software. However, in shutting off the electrical trim system, they also shut off their ability to trim the [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]] into a neutral position with the electrical switch located on their [[yoke (aeronautics)|yokes]]. The only other possible way to move the stabilizer would be by cranking the wheel by hand, but because the stabilizer was located opposite to the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], strong aerodynamic forces were pushing on it. As the pilots had inadvertently left the engines on full takeoff power, which caused the plane to accelerate at high speed, there was further pressure on the stabilizer. The pilots' attempts to manually crank the stabilizer back into position failed. Three minutes into the flight, with the aircraft continuing to lose altitude and accelerating beyond its safety limits, the captain instructed the first officer to request permission from air traffic control to return to the airport. Permission was granted, and the air traffic controllers diverted other approaching flights. Following instructions from air traffic control, they turned the aircraft to the east, and it rolled to the right. The right wing came to point down as the turn steepened. At 8:43, having struggled to keep the plane's nose from diving further by manually pulling the yoke, the captain asked the first officer to help him, and turned the electrical trim tab system back on in the hope that it would allow him to put the stabilizer back into neutral trim. However, in turning the trim system back on, he also reactivated the MCAS system, which pushed the nose further down. The captain and first officer attempted to raise the nose by manually pulling their yokes, but the aircraft continued to plunge toward the ground.<ref name=\"nymag\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|title=Boeing 737 Max Hit Trouble Right Away, Pilot\u2019s Tense Radio Messages Show|last=Gebrekidan|first=Selam|date=2019-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-16|last2=Glanz|first2=James|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315210038/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft disappeared from radar screens and crashed at almost 08:44, six minutes after takeoff<!--, having reached an altitude of about 7,000 feet [[Above Ground Level]]{{fv}}-->.<ref name=et302prelimreport /><!-- Aviation Herald mean to use the abbreviation AMSL = \"Above Mean Sea Level\".

The aircraft took off from Addis Ababa at 08:38 [[East Africa Time|local time]] (05:38 [[coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) with 149 passengers and 8 crew on board.<ref name=National /> One minute into the flight, the first officer, acting on the instructions of the captain, reported a \"flight control\" problem to the control tower. Two minutes into the flight, the plane's [[Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System|MCAS]] system activated, pitching the plane into a dive toward the ground. The pilots struggled to control it and managed to prevent the nose from diving further, but the plane continued to lose altitude. The MCAS then activated again, dropping the nose even further down. The pilots then flipped a pair of switches to disable the electrical [[trim tab]] system, which also disabled the MCAS software. However, in shutting off the electrical trim system, they also shut off their ability to trim the [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]] into a neutral position with the electrical switch located on their [[yoke (aeronautics)|yokes]]. The only other possible way to move the stabilizer would be by cranking the wheel by hand, but because the stabilizer was located opposite to the [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], strong aerodynamic forces were pushing on it. As the pilots had inadvertently left the engines on full takeoff power, which caused the plane to accelerate at high speed, there was further pressure on the stabilizer. The pilots' attempts to manually crank the stabilizer back into position failed. Three minutes into the flight, with the aircraft continuing to lose altitude and accelerating beyond its safety limits, the captain instructed the first officer to request permission from air traffic control to return to the airport. Permission was granted, and the air traffic controllers diverted other approaching flights. Following instructions from air traffic control, they turned the aircraft to the east, and it rolled to the right. The right wing came to point down as the turn steepened. At 8:43, having struggled to keep the plane's nose from diving further by manually pulling the yoke, the captain asked the first officer to help him, and turned the electrical trim tab system back on in the hope that it would allow him to put the stabilizer back into neutral trim. However, in turning the trim system back on, he also reactivated the MCAS system, which pushed the nose further down. The captain and first officer attempted to raise the nose by manually pulling their yokes, but the aircraft continued to plunge toward the ground.<ref name=\"nymag\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|title=Boeing 737 Max Hit Trouble Right Away, Pilot\u2019s Tense Radio Messages Show|last=Gebrekidan|first=Selam|date=2019-03-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-16|last2=Glanz|first2=James|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190315210038/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/world/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines.html|archive-date=15 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft disappeared from radar screens and crashed at almost 08:44, six minutes after takeoff<!--, having reached an altitude of about 7,000 feet [[Above Ground Level]]{{fv}}-->.<ref name=et302prelimreport /><!-- Aviation Herald mean to use the abbreviation AMSL = \"Above Mean Sea Level\".

S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M. L.

He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it.... All defined a Hindu no less than a British \"other\".'</ref> When Gandhi called off the Non-co-operation movement due to outbreaks of violence, Muslims disagreed with his strategy. Once the movements failed, the mobilised Muslims turned their anger towards Hindus.<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001}}; {{harvp|Misra, Identity and Religion: Foundations of Anti-Islamism in India|2004}}</ref> The first major incident of religious violence was reportedly the [[Moplah rebellion]] in August 1921, it was widely narrated that the rebellion ended in large-scale violence against Hindu in [[Malabar region|Malabar]].  A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident. The above incident vastly enhanced the prestige of the RSS and enabled its subsequent expansion.{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Stigmatisation and emulation ===\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] points out the theme of \"stigmatisation and emulation\" in the ideology of the RSS along with other Hindu nationalist movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] and the Hindu Mahasabha.  Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

In 1966 Golwalkar, in his book titled ''[[Bunch of Thoughts]]'' asserted:{{Quote|Our Constitution too is just a cumbersome and heterogeneous piecing together of various articles from various Constitutions of Western countries.

A Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to the murder of Gandhi was set, and its report was published by India's Ministry of Home Affairs in the year 1970. Accordingly, the [[Kapur Commission|Justice Kapur Commission]]<ref name=\"kapoor\">{{cite book|title=Report of Commission of Inquiry into Conspiracy to murder Mahatma Gandhi, By India (Republic).

Following his release in August 1948, Golwalkar wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to lift the ban on RSS. After Nehru replied that the matter was the responsibility of the Home Minister, Golwalkar consulted Vallabhai Patel regarding the same. Patel then demanded an absolute pre-condition that the RSS adopt a formal written constitution<ref name=\"PLJ100\">{{cite book |last1=Panicker |first1=P L John |title=Gandhian approach to communalism in contemporary India |page=100 |url=https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/7178/9/09_chapter%202.pdf#page=79 |accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref> and make it public, where Patel expected RSS to pledge its loyalty to the [[Constitution of India]], accept the Tricolor as the [[National Flag]] of India, define the power of the head of the organisation, make the organisation democratic by holding internal elections, authorisation of their parents before enrolling the pre-adolescents into the movement, and to renounce violence and secrecy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=88, 89}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=14}}<ref name=\"Noorani2000\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PnBFW7cdtsC&pg=PT42|title=The RSS and the BJP: A Division of Labour|author=Abdul Gafoor Abdul Majeed Noorani|publisher=LeftWord Books|year=2000|isbn=978-81-87496-13-7}}</ref>{{rp|42\u2013}} Golwalkar launched a huge agitation against this demand during which he was imprisoned again. Later, a constitution was drafted for RSS, which, however, initially did not meet any of Patel's demands. After a failed attempt to agitate again, eventually the RSS's constitution was amended according to Patel's wishes with the exception of the procedure for selecting the head of the organisation and the enrolment of pre-adolescents. However, the organisation's internal democracy which was written into its constitution, remained a 'dead letter'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=89}}\n\nOn 11 July 1949 the Government of India lifted the ban on the RSS by issuing a communique stating that the decision to lift the ban on the RSS had been taken in view of the RSS leader Golwalkar's undertaking to make the group's loyalty towards the Constitution of India and acceptance and respect towards the National Flag of India more explicit in the Constitution of the RSS, which was to be worked out in a democratic manner.<ref name=\"Curran1950\"/><ref name=\"Noorani2000\" />\n\n===Decolonisation of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Goa===\n\nAfter India had achieved independence, the RSS was one of the socio-political organisations that supported and participated in movements to decolonise [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], which at that time was ruled by Portugal. In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref> On the night of 21 July, United Front of Goans, a group working independently of the coalition, captured the Portuguese police station at Dadra and declared Dadra independent. Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954. A native administration was set up with Appasaheb Karmalkar of the NMLO as the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 11 August 1954.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\" />\n\nThe capture of Dadra and Nagar Haveli gave a boost to the movement against Portuguese colonial rule in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\"/> In 1955 RSS leaders demanded the end of Portuguese rule in Goa and its integration into India. When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression. On 15 August 1955, the Portuguese police opened fire on the ''satyagrahis'', killing thirty or so civilians.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=130}}\n\nGoa was later [[Annexation of Goa|annexed into the Indian union]] in 1961 through an army operation, codenamed '[[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]', that was carried out by the Nehru government.\n\n===War-time activities===\nAfter the declaration of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Bangladesh War of Independence]] by [[Indira Gandhi]], RSS provided support to the government, by offering its services to maintain law and order in Delhi and its volunteers were apparently the first to donate blood.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=243}}\n\n===Movement against the Emergency===\nIn 1975 the Indira Gandhi government proclaimed [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule in India]], thereby suspending [[fundamental rights (India)|fundamental rights]] and curtailing the [[freedom of the press]].<ref name=emma>Emma Tarlo, ''Unsettling Memories: Narratives of India's \"emergency\"'', Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7824-066-1}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7824-066-4}}</ref> This action was taken after the Supreme Court of India cancelled her election to the Indian Parliament on charges of [[malpractice]]s in the election.<ref name=emma/> Democratic institutions were suspended and prominent opposition leaders, including Gandhian [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], were arrested whilst thousands of people were detained without any charges taken up against them.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008}} RSS, which was seen as being close to opposition leaders, and with its large organisational base was seen to have the capability of organising protests against the government, was also banned.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=297}}\n\nDeoras, the then chief of RSS, wrote letters to Indira Gandhi, promising her to extend the organisation's co-operation in return for the lifting of the ban, asserting that RSS had no connection with the [[Bihar Movement|movement in Bihar]] and [[Navnirman Andolan|that in Gujarat]].

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]]]]\nRSS was founded in 1925 by [[K. B. Hedgewar|Keshav Baliram Hedgewar]], a doctor in the city of [[Nagpur]], British India.<ref name=\"Curran1950\">{{cite journal |first=Jean A. |last=Curran |jstor=3023941 |title=The RSS: Militant Hinduism |journal=Far Eastern Survey |volume=19 |pages=93\u201398 |number=10 |date= 17 May 1950 |doi=10.2307/3023941}}</ref>\n\nHedgewar was a political protege of [[B. S. Moonje]], a [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilakite]] [[Indian National Congress|Congressman]], [[Hindu Mahasabha]] politician and social activist from Nagpur.  Moonje had sent Hedgewar to Calcutta to pursue his medical studies and to learn combat techniques from the revolutionary secret societies of the Bengalis.  Hedgewar became a member of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], an anti-British revolutionary group, getting into its inner circle. The secretive methods of these societies were eventually used by him in organising the RSS.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAfter returning to Nagpur, Hedgewar organised anti-British activities through the ''Kranti Dal'' (Party of Revolution) and participated in independence activist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]]'s Home Rule campaign in 1918.  According to the official RSS history,{{sfn|Bhishikar|1979}} he came to realise that revolutionary activities alone were not enough to overthrow the British. After reading [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s ''[[Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?|Hindutva]]'', published in Nagpur in 1923, and meeting Savarkar in the [[Ratnagiri]] prison in 1925, Hedgewar was extremely influenced by him, and he founded the RSS with the objective of strengthening the Hindu society.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}\n\n[[File:RSS meeting 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A rare group [[photo]] of six initial ''swayamsevaks'' taken on the occasion of a RSS meeting held in 1939<ref>Krant M. L. Verma ''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol{{nbsp}}3) p.{{nbsp}}854 (Dr.{{nbsp}}Hedgewar with five other ''swayamsevaks'' who established RSS in 1925)</ref>]]\nHedgewar believed that a handful of British were able to rule over the vast country of India because Hindus were disunited, lacked valour (''pararkram'') and lacked a civic character.  He recruited energetic Hindu youth with revolutionary fervour, gave them a uniform of a black forage cap, khaki shirt (later white shirt) and khaki shorts\u2014emulating the British police\u2014and taught them paramilitary techniques with ''lathi'' (bamboo staff), sword, javelin, and dagger. Hindu ceremonies and rituals played a large role in the organisation, not so much for religious observance, but to provide awareness of India's glorious past and to bind the members in a religious communion. Hedgewar also held weekly sessions of what he called ''baudhik'' (ideological education), consisting of simple questions to the novices concerning the Hindu nation and its history and heroes, especially warrior king [[Shivaji]]. The saffron flag of Shivaji, the [[Bhagwa Dhwaj]], was used as the emblem for the new organisation. Its public tasks involved protecting Hindu pilgrims at festivals and confronting Muslim resistance against Hindu processions near mosques.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1998|p=59}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=33\u201339}}{{sfn|Kelkar|2011|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nTwo years into the life of the organisation, in 1927, Hedgewar organised an \"Officers' Training Camp\" with the objective of forming a corps of key workers, whom he called ''pracharaks''. He asked the volunteers to become [[sadhu]]s first, renouncing professional and family lives and dedicating themselves to the cause of the RSS.  According to scholar [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], Hedgewar embraced this doctrine after it had been reinterpreted by nationalists such as [[Aurobindo]]. The tradition of renunciation gave the RSS the character of a 'Hindu sect'.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=40\u201341}} Development of the ''shakha'' network of the RSS was the main preoccupation for Hedgewar throughout his career as the RSS chief.  The first ''pracharaks'' were responsible for establishing as many ''shakhas'' as possible, first in Nagpur, then across Maharashtra and eventually in the rest of India. [[Prabhakar Balwant Dani|P. B. Dani]] was sent to establish a ''shakha'' at the [[Benaras Hindu University]] and other universities were similarly targeted to recruit new followers among the student population.  Three ''pracharaks'' went to Punjab: Appaji Joshi to [[Sialkot]], Moreshwar Munje to the [[DAV College]] in [[Rawalpindi]] and Raja Bhau Paturkar to the [[DAV College]] in [[Lahore]].  In 1940, Madhavrao Muley was appointed as the ''prant pracharak'' (regional missionary) in Lahore.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=65\u201367}}\n\n== Motivations ==\nScholars differ on Hedgewar's motivations for forming the RSS, especially because he never involved the RSS in fighting the British rule. Jaffrelot says that the RSS was intended to propagate the ideology of [[Hindutva]] and to provide \"new physical strength\" to the majority community.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot 2010\"/> An alternative interpretation is that he formed it to fight the Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=249}}\n\n=== Tilakite ideology ===\nAfter Tilak's demise in 1920, like other followers of Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. Gandhi's stance on the Indian Muslim [[Khilafat Movement|Khilafat issue]] was a cause for concern to Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the 'cow protection' was not on the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] agenda. This led Hedgewar, along with other Tilakities, to part ways with Gandhi. In 1921, Hedgewar delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra with slogans such as \"Freedom within a year\" and \"boycott\". He deliberately broke the law, for which he was imprisoned for a year. After being released in 1922, Hedgewar was distressed at the lack of organisation among the Congress volunteers for the independence struggle. Without proper mobilisation and organisation, he felt that the patriotic youth of India could never get independence for the country. Subsequently, he felt the need to create an independent organisation that was based on the country's traditions and history.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\n=== Hindu-Muslim relations ===\nThe decade of 1920s witnessed a significant deterioration in the relations between Hindus and Muslims.  The Muslim masses were mobilised by the [[Khilafat movement]], demanding the reinstatement of the Caliphate in Turkey, and [[Gandhi]] made an alliance with it for conducting his own [[Non-co-operation movement]]. Gandhi aimed to create [[Hindu-Muslim unity]] in forming the alliance. However, the alliance saw a \"common enemy\", not a \"common enmity\".<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001|p=27}}. Quote: '... mobilizaiton of Indian Muslims in the name of Islam and in defense of the Ottoman ''khalifa'' was inherently \"communal\", no less than the Islamic movements of opposition to British imperialism which preceded it.... All defined a Hindu no less than a British \"other\".'</ref> When Gandhi called off the Non-co-operation movement due to outbreaks of violence, Muslims disagreed with his strategy. Once the movements failed, the mobilised Muslims turned their anger towards Hindus.<ref>{{harvp|Stern, Democracy and Dictatorship in South Asia|2001}}; {{harvp|Misra, Identity and Religion: Foundations of Anti-Islamism in India|2004}}</ref> The first major incident of religious violence was reportedly the [[Moplah rebellion]] in August 1921, it was widely narrated that the rebellion ended in large-scale violence against Hindu in [[Malabar region|Malabar]].  A cycle of inter-communal violence throughout India followed for several years.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|pp=19\u201320}} In 1923, there were riots in Nagpur, called \"Muslim riots\" by Hedgewar, where Hindus were felt to be \"totally disorganized and panicky.\" These incidents made a major impression on Hedgewar and convinced him of the need to organise the Hindu society.{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|1996|p=34}}\n\nAfter acquiring about 100 ''swayamsevaks'' (volunteers) to the RSS in 1927, Hedgewar took the issue to the Muslim domain. He led the Hindu religious procession for [[Ganesha]], beating the drums in defiance of the usual practice not to pass in front of a mosque with music.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|p=40}} On the day of [[Lakshmi Puja]] on 4 September, Muslims are said to have retaliated.  When the Hindu procession reached a mosque in the Mahal area of Nagpur, Muslims blocked it. Later in the afternoon, they attacked the Hindu residences in the Mahal area. It is said that the RSS cadres were prepared for the attack and beat the Muslim rioters back. [[1927 Nagpur riots|Riots]] continued for 3 days and the army had to be called in to quell the violence. RSS organised the Hindu resistance and protected the Hindu households while the Muslim households had to leave Nagpur ''en masse'' for safety.{{sfn|Chitkara, National Upsurge|2004|p=250}}{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Kelkar|1950|p=138}}{{sfn|Frykenberg|1996|p=241}} Tapan Basu et al. note the accounts of \"Muslim aggressiveness\" and the \"Hindu self-defence\" in the RSS descriptions of the incident. The above incident vastly enhanced the prestige of the RSS and enabled its subsequent expansion.{{sfn|Basu & Sarkar, Khaki Shorts and Saffron Flags|1993|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n=== Stigmatisation and emulation ===\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] points out the theme of \"stigmatisation and emulation\" in the ideology of the RSS along with other Hindu nationalist movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] and the Hindu Mahasabha.  Muslims, Christians and the British were thought of as \"foreign bodies\" implanted in the Hindu nation, who were able to exploit the disunity and absence of valour among the Hindus in order to subdue them. The solution lay in emulating the characteristics of these \"Threatening Others\" that were perceived to give them strength, such as paramilitary organisation, emphasis on unity and nationalism. The Hindu nationalists combined these emulatory aspects with a selective borrowing of traditions from the Hindu past to achieve a synthesis that was uniquely Indian and Hindu.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n=== Hindu Mahasabha influence ===\nThe [[Hindu Mahasabha]], which was initially a special interest group within the [[Indian National Congress]] and later an independent party, was an important influence on the RSS, even though it is rarely acknowledged. In 1923, prominent Hindu leaders like [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] met together on this platform and voiced their concerns on the 'division in the Hindu community'. In his presidential speech to Mahasabha, Malaviya stated: \"Friendship could exist between equals. If the Hindus made themselves strong and the rowdy section among the Mahomedans were convinced they could not safely rob and dishonour Hindus, unity would be established on a stable basis.\" He wanted the activists 'to educate all boys and girls, establish ''akharas'' (gymnasiums), establish a volunteer corps to persuade people to comply with decisions of the Hindu Mahasabha, to accept untouchables as Hindus and grant them the right to use wells, enter temples, get an education.' Later, Hindu Mahasabha leader [[V. D. Savarkar]]'s 'Hindutva' ideology also had a profound impact on Hedgewar's thinking about the 'Hindu nation'.{{sfn|Andersen, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: Early Concerns|1972}}\n\nThe initial meeting for the formation of the Sangh on the [[Vijaya Dashami]] day of 1925 was held between Hedgewar and four Hindu Mahasabha leaders: [[B. S. Moonje]], [[Ganesh Savarkar]], [[L. V. Paranjpe]] and B. B. Tholkar. RSS took part as a volunteer force in organising the Hindu Mahasabha annual meeting in Akola in 1931.  Moonje remained a patron of the RSS throughout his life.  Both he and Ganesh Savarkar worked to spread the RSS ''shakhas'' in Maharashtra, Panjab, Delhi, and the princely states by initiating contacts with local leaders.  Savarkar merged his own youth organisation ''Tarun Hindu Sabha'' with the RSS and helped its expansion. V. D. Savarkar, after his release in 1937, joined them in spreading the RSS and giving speeches in its support.  Officials in the Home Department called the RSS the \"volunteer organisation of the Hindu Mahasabha.\"{{sfn|Bapu|2013|pp=97\u2013100}}{{sfn|Goyal|1979|pp=59\u201376}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Indian Independence Movement===\nAfter the formation of the RSS, which portrays itself as a social movement, Hedgewar kept the organisation from having any direct affiliation with the political organisations then fighting British rule.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|title=RSS aims for a Hindu nation|date=10 March 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011631/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/655722.stm|archive-date=24 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> RSS rejected Gandhi's willingness to co-operate with the Muslims.{{sfn|Nussbaum, The Clash Within|2008|p=156}}{{sfn|Bhatt, Hindu Nationalism|2001|p=115}}\n\nIn accordance with Hedgewar's tradition of keeping the RSS away from the Indian Independence movement, any political activity that could be construed as being anti-British was carefully avoided.

It stated:{{Quote|Even though Dr. Ambedkar is reported to have recently stated in [[Bombay]] that the days of Manu have ended it is nevertheless a fact that the daily lives of Hindus are even at present-day affected by the principles and injunctions contained in the ''Manusmrithi'' and other ''[[Smriti]]s''.

In early 1954 volunteers Raja Wakankar and Nana Kajrekar of the RSS visited the area round about Dadra, Nagar Haveli, and Daman several times to study the topography and get acquainted with locals who wanted the area to change from being a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] to being an [[States and Territories of India|Indian union territory]]. In April 1954 the RSS formed a coalition with the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO) and the Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) for the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli into the Republic of India.<ref name=\"PurushottamShripad\">Purushottam Shripad Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, published by Usha P.

Subsequently, on 28 July, volunteer teams from the RSS and AGD captured the territories of Naroli and Phiparia and ultimately the capital of [[Silvassa]]. The Portuguese forces that had escaped and moved towards Nagar Haveli, were assaulted at Khandvel and forced to retreat until they surrendered to the Indian border police at Udava on 11 August 1954.

When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to provide an armed intervention, RSS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi led the Satyagraha agitation straight into Goa. He was imprisoned with his followers by the Portuguese police. The nonviolent protests continued but met with repression.

When Golwalkar wrote to Nehru asking for the lifting of the ban on RSS after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru replied that the government had proof that RSS activities were 'anti-national' by virtue of being 'communalist'. In his letter to the heads of provincial governments in December 1947, Nehru wrote that \"we have a great deal of evidence to show that RSS is an organisation which is in the nature of a private army and which is definitely proceeding on the strictest Nazi lines, even following the techniques of the organisation\".{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=87, 88}}\n\nSardar [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Vallabhai Patel]], the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, said in early January 1948 that the RSS activists were \"patriots who love their country\". He asked the Congressmen to 'win over' the RSS by love, instead of trying to 'crush' them. He also appealed to the RSS to join the Congress instead of opposing it. Jaffrelot says that this attitude of Patel can be partly explained by the assistance the RSS gave the Indian administration in maintaining public order in September 1947, and that his expression of 'qualified sympathy' towards RSS reflected the long-standing inclination of several Hindu traditionalists in Congress. However, after Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948, Patel began to view that the activities of RSS were a danger to public security.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalist Movement|1996|pp=86-}}{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=12}} In his reply letter to Golwalkar on 11 September 1948 regarding the lifting of ban on RSS, Patel stated that though RSS did service to the Hindu society by helping and protecting the Hindus when in need during partition violence, they also began attacking Muslims with revenge and went against \"innocent men, women and children\". He said that the speeches of RSS were \"full of communal poison\", and as a result of that 'poison', he remarked, India had to lose Gandhi, noting that the RSS men had celebrated Gandhi's death. Patel was also apprehensive of the secrecy in the working manner of RSS, and complained that all of its provincial heads were Maratha Brahmins. He criticised the RSS for having its own army inside India, which he said, cannot be permitted as \"it was a potential danger to the State\". He also remarked: \"The members of RSS claimed to be the defenders of Hinduism. But they must understand that Hinduism would not be saved by rowdyism.\"{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=82}}\n\n[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first President of India, did not approve of RSS. In 1948, he criticised RSS for carrying out 'loot, arson, rioting and killing of Muslims' in Delhi and other Hindu majority areas. In his letter to home minister Patel on 14 May 1948, he stated that RSS men had planned to dress up as Muslims in Hindu majority areas and attack Muslims in Muslim majority areas to create trouble. He asked Patel to take strict action against RSS for aiming to create enmity among Hindus and Muslims. He called RSS a [[Maharashtrian Brahmin]] movement, and viewed it as a secret organisation which used violence and promoted fascism, without any regard to truthful means and constitutional methods. He stated that RSS was \"definitely a menace to public peace\".{{sfn|Patel, Prasad and Rajaji: Myth of the Indian Right|2015|pp=113}}\n\nField Marshal [[K. M.

of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all.<ref name=\"bunch\">M S Golwalkar, Bunch of Thoughts, Publishers: Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana</ref> [[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]], the worldview that the whole world is one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.<ref name=\"sheshadri\">H. V. Seshadri, ''Hindu renaissance under way'', Published in 1984, Jagarana Prakashana, Distributors, Rashtrotthana Sahitya (Bangalore)</ref>\n\nBut the immediate focus, the leaders believe, is on the Hindu renaissance, which would build an egalitarian society and a strong India that could propound this philosophy. Hence, the focus is on social reform, economic upliftment of the downtrodden, and the protection of the cultural diversity of the natives in India.<ref name=\"sheshadri\" /> The organisation says it aspires to unite all Hindus and build a strong India that can contribute to the welfare of the world. In the words of RSS ideologue and the second head of the RSS, Golwalkar, \"in order to be able to contribute our unique knowledge to mankind, in order to be able to live and strive for the unity and welfare of the world, we stand before the world as a self-confident, resurgent and mighty nation\".<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n\nIn ''Vichardhara'' (ideology), Golwalkar affirms the RSS mission of integration as:<ref name=\"bunch\" />\n{{Quote|RSS has been making determined efforts to inculcate in our people the burning devotion for Bharat and its national ethos; kindle in them the spirit of dedication and sterling qualities and character; rouse social consciousness, mutual good-will, love and cooperation among them all; to make them realise that casts, creeds, and languages are secondary and that service to the nation is the supreme end and to mold their behaviour accordingly; instill in them a sense of true humility and discipline and train their bodies to be strong and robust so as to shoulder any social responsibility; and thus to create all-round Anushasana (Discipline) in all walks of life and build together all our people into a unified harmonious national whole, extending from Himalayas to Kanyakumari.|[[M.

The movement considers Hindus as inclusive of Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, tribals, untouchables, Veerashaivism, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, and other groups as a community, a view similar to the inclusive referencing of the term Hindu in the Indian Constitution Article 25 (2)(b).<ref>Martin E.

He pledged the support of the RSS for this movement.<ref>Suresh Ramabhai, ''Vinoba and his mission'', published by Akhil Bharat Sarv Seva Sangh, 1954</ref> Consequently, many RSS volunteers, led by [[Nanaji Deshmukh]], participated in the movement.{{sfn|Andersen|Damle|1987|p=111}} But Golwalkar was also critical of the Bhoodan movement on other occasions for being reactionary and for working \"merely with a view to counteracting Communism\". He believed that the movement should inculcate a faith in the masses that would make them rise above the base appeal of Communism.<ref name=bunch/>\n\n=== Reform in 'caste' ===\nThe RSS has advocated the training of Dalits and other backward classes as temple high priests (a position traditionally reserved for [[Caste]] [[Brahmins]] and denied to lower castes).

K. Advani]] have complained about the RSS's interference in party politics. Though some former Hindu nationalists believed that Sangh should take part in politics, they failed to draw the RSS, which was intended to be a purely cultural movement, into the political arena until the 1950s. Savarkar tried to convince Hedgewar and later Golwalkar, to tie up with Hindu Mahasabha, but failed to do so.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nUnder pressure from other ''swayamsevaks'', Golwalkar gradually changed his mind after independence under unusual circumstances during the ban on RSS in 1948 after the assassination of Gandhi. After the first wave of arrests of RSS activists at that time, some of its members who had gone underground recommended that their movement be involved in politics, seeing that no political force was present to advocate the cause of RSS in parliament or anywhere else. One such member who significantly suggested this cause was [[K. R. Malkani]], who wrote in 1949:{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n{{quote|Sangh must take part in politics not only to protect itself against the greedy design of politicians, but to stop the un-Bharatiya and anti-Bharatiya policies of the Government and to advance and expedite the cause of Bharatiya through state machinery side by side with official effort in the same direction. ... Sangh must continue as it is, an ''ashram'' for the national cultural education of the entire citizenry, but it must develop a political wing for the more effective and early achievement of its ideals.}}\n\nGolwalkar approved of Malkani's and others' views regarding the formation of a new party in 1950. Jaffrelot says that the death of Sardar Patel influenced this change since Golwalkar opined that Patel could have transformed the Congress party by emphasising its affinities with Hindu nationalism, while after Patel, Nehru became strong enough to impose his 'anti-communal' line within his party. Accordingly, Golwalkar met [[Syama Prasad Mukherjee]] and agreed for endorsing senior ''swayamsevaks'', who included [[Deendayal Upadhyaya]], Balraj Madhok and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], to the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], a newly formed political party by Mukherjee. These men, who took their orders in Nagpur, captured power in the party after Mukherjee's death.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\n[[Balasaheb Deoras]], who succeeded Golwalkar as the chief of RSS, got very much involved in politics. In 1965, when he was the general secretary of the RSS, he addressed the annual meeting of Jana Sangh, which is seen as an \"unprecedented move\" by an RSS dignitary that reflected his strong interest in politics and his will to make the movement play a larger part in the public sphere. Jaffrelot says that he exemplified the specific kind of swayamsevaks known as 'activists', giving expression to his leanings towards political activism by having the RSS support the [[Bihar Movement|JP Movement]].{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The importance that RSS began to give to the electoral politics is demonstrated when its units (''shakhas'') were made constituency-based in the early 1970s, from which the RSS shakhas began to involve directly in elections, not only of legislatures, but also of trade unions, student and cultural organisations.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}}\n\nAs soon as the RSS men took over the Jana Sangh party, the Hindu traditionalists who previously joined the party because of S. P. Mukherjee were sidelined.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Your explanation here}} The organisation of the party was restructured and all its organisational secretaries, who were the pillars of the party, came from the RSS, both at the district and state level. The party also took the vision of RSS in its mission, where its ultimate objective, in the long run, was the reform of society, but not the conquest of power, since the 'state' was not viewed as a prominent institution. Hence the Jana Sangh initially remained reluctant to join any alliance that was not fully in harmony with its ideology. In 1962, Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was the party's chief, explained this approach by saying that \"coalitions were bound to degenerate into a struggle for power by opportunist elements coming together in the interest of expediency\". He wanted to build the party as an alternative party to the Congress and saw the elections as an \"opportunity to educate the people on political issues and to challenge the right of the Congress to be in power\". Jaffrelot says that this indifferent approach of party politics was in accordance with its lack of interest in the 'state' and the wish to make it weaker, or more decentralised.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} After India's defeat in the [[Sino-Indian War|1962 Sino\u2013Indian war]], the RSS and other right-wing forces in India were strengthened since the leftist and centrist opinions, sometimes even Nehru himself, could then be blamed for being 'soft' towards China. The RSS and Jana Sangh also took complete advantage of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with Pakistan]] to \"deepen suspicion about Muslims\", and also en-cashed the growing unpopularity of Congress, particularly in the [[Hindi Belt|Hindi-belt]], where a left-wing alternative was weak or non-existent.{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were banning [[Cattle slaughter in India|cow slaughter]], abolishing the [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special status given to Jammu and Kashmir]], and legislating a [[uniform civil code]]. Explaining the Jana Sangh's failure to become a major political force despite claiming to represent the national interests of the Hindus, scholar Bruce Desmond Graham states that the party's close initial ties with the Hindi-belt and its preoccupation with the issues of North India such as promotion of Hindi, energetic resistance to Pakistan etc., had become a serious disadvantage to the party in the long run. He also adds that its interpretation of Hinduism was \"restrictive and exclusive\", arguing that \"its doctrines were inspired by an activist version of Hindu nationalism and, indirectly, by the values of [[Brahmanism]] rather than the devotional and quietist values of popular Hinduism.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=253}} Desmond says that, if the Jana Sangh had carefully moderated its Hindu nationalism, it could have been able to well-exploit any strong increase in support for the traditional and nationalist Hindu opinion, and hence to compete on equal terms with the Congress in the northern states. He also remarks that if it had adopted a less harsh attitude towards Pakistan and Muslims, \"it would have been much more acceptable to Hindu traditionalists in the central and southern states, where partition had left fewer emotional scars.\"{{sfn|Graham; Hindu Nationalism and Indian Politics|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Jana Sangh started making alliances by entering the anti-Congress coalitions since 1960s. It became part of the 1971 Grand Alliance and finally merged itself with the [[Janata Party]] in 1977.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}} The success of Janata Party in [[1977 Indian general election|1977 elections]] made the RSS members central ministers for the first time (Vajpayee, Advani and [[Brij Lal Verma]]),{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} and provided the RSS with an opportunity to avail the state and its instruments to further its ends, through the resources of various state governments as well as the central government.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8v7Vr2iQUHkC&pg=PA240|title=India Since Independence: Making Sense of Indian Politics|last=Krishna|first=Ananth V.|publisher=Pearson Education India|year=2011|isbn=9788131734650|pages=240|language=en}}</ref> However, this merge, which was seen as a dilution of its original doctrine, was viewed by the ex-Jana Sanghis as submersion of their initial identity. Meanwhile, the other components of the Janata Party denounced the allegiance the ex-Jana Sanghis continued to pay to the RSS. This led to a 'dual membership' controversy, regarding the links the former Jana Sangh members were retaining with the RSS, and it led to the split of Janata Party in 1979.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}\n\nThe former Jana Sangh elements formed a new party, [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), in 1980. However, BJP originated more as a successor to the Janata Party and did not return to the beginning stages of the Hindu nationalist identity and Jana Sangh doctrines. The RSS resented this dilution of ideology \u2013 the new slogans promoted by the then BJP president Vajpayee like 'Gandhian socialism' and 'positive secularism'. By early 1980s, RSS is said to have established its political strategy of \"never keeping all its eggs in one basket\". It even decided to support Congress in some states, for instance, to create the [[Hindu Munnani]] in Tamil Nadu in the backdrop of the [[1981 Meenakshipuram conversion|1981 Meenakshipuram mass conversion to Islam]], and to support one of its offshoots, [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP), to launch an enthno-religious movement on the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. BJP did not have much electoral success in its initial years and was able to win only two seats in the [[1984 Indian general election|1984 elections]]. After L. K. Advani replaced Vajpayee as party president in 1986, the BJP also began to rally around the Ayodhya campaign. In 1990, the party organised the ''[[Ram Rath Yatra]]'' to advance this campaign in large-scale.{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175\u2013179}}{{sfn|Tapan Basu, Khaki Shorts|1993|pp=51\u201354}} Advani also attacked the then ruling Congress party with the slogans such as '[[pseudo-secularism]]', accusing Congress of misusing secularism for the political appeasement of minorities, and established an explicit and unambiguous path of Hindu revival.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 'instrumentalisation' of the Ayodhya issue and the related communal riots which polarised the electorate along religious lines helped the BJP make good progress in the subsequent elections of [[1989 Indian general election|1989]], [[1991 Indian general election|1991]] and [[1996 Indian general election|1996]]. However, in the mid-1990s, BJP adopted a more moderate approach to politics in order to make allies. As Jaffrelot remarks, it was because the party realised during then that it would not be in a position to form the government on its own in the near future. In 1998, it built a major coalition, [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA), in the Lok Sabha and succeeded in the [[1998 Indian general election|general election in 1998]], and was able to succeed again in the [[1999 Indian general election|mid-term elections of 1999]], with Vajpayee as their Prime Ministerial candidate. Though the RSS and other Sangh Parivar components appreciated some of the steps taken by the Vajpayee government, like the [[Pokhran-II|testing of a nuclear bomb]], they felt disappointed with the government's overall performance. The fact that no solid step was taken towards building the [[Rama|Ram]] temple in Ayodhya was resented by the VHP. The [[Premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee#Economic policy|liberalisation policy of the government]] faced objection from the [[Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh]], a trade union controlled by the RSS. Jaffrelot says, RSS and the other Sangh Parivar elements had come to the view that the \"BJP leaders had been victims of their thirst for power: they had preferred to compromise to remain in office instead of sticking to their principles.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot, Hindu Nationalism Reader|2007|p=175-179}}\n\nAfter the end of Vajpayee's tenure in 2004, BJP remained as a major opposition party in the subsequent years; and again in the year 2014, the NDA came to power after BJP gained an overwhelming majority in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general elections]], with [[Narendra Modi]], a former RSS member who previously served as Gujarat's chief minister for three tenures, as their prime ministerial candidate.

That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild.

For the video game, see\u00a0Squids (video game).\n\nSquid\u00a0are\u00a0cephalopods\u00a0in the superorder\u00a0Decapodiformes\u00a0with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight\u00a0arms\u00a0and two\u00a0tentacles. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head,\u00a0bilateral symmetry, and a\u00a0mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like\u00a0octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like\u00a0gladius\u00a0or pen, made of\u00a0chitin.\n\nSquid\n\nTemporal range:\u00a0Early Devonian \u2013 Recent[1]\u00a0\n\nPre\u0404\n\n\u0404\n\nO\n\nS\n\nD\n\nC\n\nP\n\nT\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nPg\n\nN\n\nCaribbean reef squid\u00a0(Sepioteuthis sepioidea)Scientific classificationKingdom:AnimaliaPhylum:MolluscaClass:CephalopodaSubclass:Coleoidea(unranked):NeocoleoideaSuperorder:Decapodiformes\nLeach, 1817[2]Orders[3]MyopsidaOegopsida\u00a0d'Orbigny, 1845Sepiida\u00a0Zittel, 1895Spirulida\u00a0Stolley, 1919Teuthida\u00a0Naef, 1916\u00a0(nomen dubium)Decapodiformes\u00a0incertae sedisBathyteuthoidea\u00a0Vecchione,\u00a0Young, &\u00a0Sweeney, 2004Idiosepiidae\u00a0Appell\u00f6f, 1898SynonymsDecembrachiata\u00a0Winckworth, 1932\n\nSquid diverged from other cephalopods during the\u00a0Jurassic\u00a0and occupy a similar role to\u00a0teleost\u00a0fish as open water\u00a0predators\u00a0of similar size and behaviour. They play an important role in the open water food web. The two long tentacles are used to grab prey and the eight arms to hold and control it. The beak then cuts the food into suitable size chunks for swallowing. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by\u00a0jet propulsion, and largely locate their prey by sight. They are among the most intelligent of\u00a0invertebrates, with groups of\u00a0Humboldt squid\u00a0having been observed\u00a0hunting cooperatively. They are preyed on by\u00a0sharks, other fish, sea birds,\u00a0seals\u00a0and\u00a0cetaceans, particularly\u00a0sperm whales.\n\nSquid can change colour for\u00a0camouflage\u00a0and\u00a0signalling. Some species are\u00a0bioluminescent, using their light for\u00a0counter-illumination\u00a0camouflage, while many species can eject a cloud of\u00a0ink\u00a0to distract predators.\n\nSquid are used for human consumption with commercial fisheries in Japan, the Mediterranean, the southwestern Atlantic, the eastern Pacific and elsewhere. They are used in cuisines around the world, often known as \"calamari\". Squid have featured in literature since classical times, especially in tales of giant squid and\u00a0sea monsters.\n\nContents\n\nTaxonomy and phylogeny\n\nSquid are members of the class\u00a0Cephalopoda, subclass\u00a0Coleoidea. The squid\u00a0ordersMyopsida\u00a0and\u00a0Oegopsida\u00a0are in the superorder\u00a0Decapodiformes\u00a0(from the\u00a0Greek\u00a0for \"ten-legged\"). Two other orders of decapodiform cephalopods are also called squid, although they are\u00a0taxonomically\u00a0distinct from squids and differ recognizably in their gross anatomical features. They are the\u00a0bobtail squid\u00a0of order\u00a0Sepiolida\u00a0and the\u00a0ram's horn squid\u00a0of the monotypic order\u00a0Spirulida. The\u00a0vampire squid\u00a0(Vampyroteuthis\u00a0infernalis), however, is more closely related to the octopuses than to any squid.[4]\n\nThe\u00a0cladogram, not fully resolved, is based on Sanchez et al., 2018[4]. Their\u00a0molecular phylogeny\u00a0used\u00a0mitochondrial\u00a0and\u00a0nuclear DNA\u00a0marker sequences; they comment that a robust\u00a0phylogeny\u00a0\"has proven very challenging to obtain\". If it is accepted that\u00a0Sepiidaecuttlefish are a kind of squid, then the squids, excluding the vampire squid, form a\u00a0cladeas illustrated.[4]\u00a0Orders are shown in boldface; all the families not included in those orders, except Sepiadariidae and Sepiidae are in the paraphyletic order \"Sepiida\", are in the\u00a0paraphyletic\u00a0order \"Oegopsida\".\n\nCephalopoda\u202f\n\nNautilus\u00a0\n\n\u202fColeoideaOctopuses\u00a0and\u00a0allies\u202f\n\nOctopoda\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u202f\n\nVampyroteuthidae\u00a0(vampire squid)\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u202fDecapodiformes\u202f\u202f\n\nCranchiinae\u00a0(glass squid A)\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u202f\u202f\n\nCycloteuthidae\n\n\u202f\u202f\u202f\n\nPsychroteuthidae\u00a0(glacial squid)\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f\n\nOnychoteuthidae(hooked squid)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u202fWHALE SHARCKS\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Towie, Narelle (18 May 2009), [http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/hopes-rise-for-wa-marine-parks/story-0-1225713460815 Better protection for 1.4m sq km of WA marine parks], ''PerthNow'', (Perth, Australia), retrieved 28 January 2010\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.saveourmarinelife.org.au/ Save Our Marine Life official site]\n\n[[Category:Conservation organisations based in Australia]]\n[[Category:Conservation in Western Australia]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| name = Save Our Marine Life\n| logo =\n| founded_date    = 2008\n| location          = [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], [[Australia]]\n| area_served     = Australia\n| focus           = [[Conservation movement|Conservation]]\n| method          = [[Lobbying]], [[Research]], [[Activism]]\n| homepage        = [http://www.saveourmarinelife.org.au/ Save Our Marine Life official website]\n}}\n'''Save Our Marine Life''' (SOML) is an Australian [[not-for-profit]], [[non-governmental organisation|non-governmental]] environmental advocacy alliance working to protect and secure Australia's marine life.
