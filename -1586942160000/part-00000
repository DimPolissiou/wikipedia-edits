The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [https://shape.nato.int/shapeinternationalschool Belgium], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [https://shape.nato.int/shapeinternationalschool Belgium], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools.

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold.

game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGen19\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Worms |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996|page=76}}</ref> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SatMag3\">{{cite magazine|last=Merrett |first=Steve |title=Review: Worms|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1996|pages=86\u201387}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series).
