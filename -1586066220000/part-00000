This is necessary for the must to achieve complete and proper [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. The grape must, together with pomace, are then placed in large containers and let to ferment. Traditionally, the must-pomace mixture was placed in large clay containers ([[pithos]], {{lang-el|\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9}}). As soon as the fermentation process has completed (i.e. the fermented must is checked and confirmed to have a value of less or equal to 0\u00b0 Baum\u00e9), the fermented must-pomace mixture is transferred to the main container of the [[still]] (kazani, {{lang-el|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9}}) for the distillation.\n\nThe traditional zivania still is called ''lampikos'' ({{lang-el|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{IPA2|lam'bikos}}; see also [[alembic]]) in the [[Cypriot_Greek|Greek dialect of Cyprus]]. In some villages of Cyprus, a single lampikos was usually shared by all villagers. The traditional zivania [[still]]s are similar to those used for [[tsikoudia]] in [[Crete]].\n\nOnce the main container of the still is hermetically shut, fire is set under it. The fire is monitored and maintained in order to produce constant heat. The first zivania that comes from the still has the highest alcohol content, while the last taken out of the apparatus has a low alcohol content and it is called ''porakos'' ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}). The first zivania is typically discarded as it is not good for drinking because it contains harmful chemicals or is used for massaging sore body parts.\n\nDepending on the pre-distillation mixture, different qualities of zivania are produced:\n\n* Zivania produced using only wine for the distillation\n* Zivania produced using wine and pomace for the distillation\n* Zivania produced using pomace, water and weak zivania\n\n==Storage and transportation==\nZivania is usually stored in clean wooden or [[galvanised]] metal containers that can be sealed in order to contain [[evaporation]]. It can be transferred to glass bottles for short storage or consumption.\n\n==Consumption and other usage==\nCypriots consume zivania throughout the year. During the summer, zivania is served ice cold.  Zivania is not usually consumed alone and it is typically served with dried nuts, [[Turkish delight|loukoumi]], [[ soutzoukos|shoushouko]] or small appetizers like Cypriot [[loukaniko]], [[lountza]] and [[tsamarella]].\n\nBefore the introduction of beer and other alcoholic drinks in Cyprus, the main alcoholic drinks Cypriots consumed were wine and zivania. In some villages of Cyprus, [[cinnamon]] is added to zivania giving it a distinct red colour, aroma and flavour. When zivania is left to age, it gains stronger flavour and aroma. Aged zivania is highly valued and is kept for consumption during special occasions or as a welcoming treat for visitors.\n\nZivania, in addition to its use as an alcoholic beverage, it is also used to treat wounds, for massaging sore body parts, as a remedy for colds and toothaches, and as a warming-up drink during the cold months of winter, especially in the villages of the [[Troodos mountains]].\n\n==Authenticity==\nTo establish the authenticity of zivania, chemical studies were contacted to investigate which of the metals analyzed constitute diagnostic parameters that establish authenticity. The results of the studies establish that zivania is related to the unique geological and climatic conditions existing on the island of Cyprus.<ref>''Authenticity of the Traditional Cypriot Spirit \"Zivania\" on the Basis of H NMR Spectroscopy Diagnostic Parameters and Statistical Analysis'' [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jafcau/2005/53/i13/abs/jf0495800.html] </ref><ref>''Authenticity of the traditional Cypriot spirit zivania''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14518949&dopt=Abstract]</ref>\n\n==Photos==\n<gallery>\nImage:Zivania.jpg|A bottle of Cypriot Zivania.\nImage:Xynisteri 1.jpg|[[Xynisteri]] grapes used in the production of zivania. \nImage:Mavro.jpg|[[Mavro]] grapes used in the production of zivania.\nImage:Kazani_amira2.jpg|Distillation apparatus (kazani) found in the village of Amiras, [[Crete]].\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pomace brandy]]\n* [[Tsipouro]]\n* [[Tsikoudia]]\n* [[Rakia]]\n* [[Pisco]]\n* [[Grappa]]\n* [[Aguardiente]]\n* [[T\u00f6rk\u00f6lyp\u00e1linka]]\n* [[Chacha (brandy)]]\n* [[Orujo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Alcoholic beverages}}\n{{Cuisine of Greece}}\n[[Category:Greek distilled drinks]]\n[[Category:Cypriot cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pomace brandies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox beverage\n| name         = Zivania ({{lang-el|\u03b6\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1}})\n| image        = Zivania.jpg\n| caption      = A bottle of Cypriot Zivania.\n| type         = [[pomace brandy]]\n| abv          = 43-60% \n| origin       = Cyprus\n| colour       = Clear, colourless\n| flavour      = Alcoholic with a light aroma of raisins\n| ingredients  = {{Plainlist|\n* grape [[pomace]]\n* dry wine\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Zivania''' or '''zivana''' ({{lang-el|\u03b6\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1}}<ref name=a>{{cite web|title=\u0396\u03b9\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03ae \u03b6\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1|url=http://foodmuseum.cs.ucy.ac.cy/web/guest/trofima/civitem/1630|website=foodmuseum.cs.ucy.ac.cy|publisher=Cyprus Food Virtual Museum|accessdate=26 November 2015|language=Greek}}</ref> [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Zibaniya<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kibristransfer.net/zivaniya/|title=Zivaniya|last=Transfer|first=K\u0131br\u0131s|date=2015-07-05|website=K\u0131br\u0131s Transfer|language=tr|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>) is a [[Cypriot cuisine|Cypriot]] [[pomace brandy]] produced from the distillation of a mixture of grape [[pomace]] and local dry wines made from [[Xynisteri]] and [[Mavro]] grapes.<ref name=b>{{cite web|title=Xynisteri|url=http://www.vounipanayiawinery.com/page/en/22/xynisteri|website=vounipanayiawinery.com|publisher=Vouni Panaya Winery|accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref> The name of zivania is derived from zivana ({{lang-el|\u03b6\u03af\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1}}) which means pomace in the [[Cypriot_Greek|Greek dialect of Cyprus]].

As soon as the fermentation process has completed (i.e. the fermented must is checked and confirmed to have a value of less or equal to 0\u00b0 Baum\u00e9), the fermented must-pomace mixture is transferred to the main container of the [[still]] (kazani, {{lang-el|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9}}) for the distillation.\n\nThe traditional zivania still is called ''lampikos'' ({{lang-el|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}, {{IPA2|lam'bikos}}; see also [[alembic]]) in the [[Cypriot_Greek|Greek dialect of Cyprus]]. In some villages of Cyprus, a single lampikos was usually shared by all villagers. The traditional zivania [[still]]s are similar to those used for [[tsikoudia]] in [[Crete]].\n\nOnce the main container of the still is hermetically shut, fire is set under it. The fire is monitored and maintained in order to produce constant heat. The first zivania that comes from the still has the highest alcohol content, while the last taken out of the apparatus has a low alcohol content and it is called ''porakos'' ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}). The first zivania is typically discarded as it is not good for drinking because it contains harmful chemicals or is used for massaging sore body parts.\n\nDepending on the pre-distillation mixture, different qualities of zivania are produced:\n\n* Zivania produced using only wine for the distillation\n* Zivania produced using wine and pomace for the distillation\n* Zivania produced using pomace, water and weak zivania\n\n==Storage and transportation==\nZivania is usually stored in clean wooden or [[galvanised]] metal containers that can be sealed in order to contain [[evaporation]]. It can be transferred to glass bottles for short storage or consumption.\n\n==Consumption and other usage==\nCypriots consume zivania throughout the year. During the summer, zivania is served ice cold.  Zivania is not usually consumed alone and it is typically served with dried nuts, [[Turkish delight|loukoumi]], [[ soutzoukos|shoushouko]] or small appetizers like Cypriot [[loukaniko]], [[lountza]] and [[tsamarella]].\n\nBefore the introduction of beer and other alcoholic drinks in Cyprus, the main alcoholic drinks Cypriots consumed were wine and zivania. In some villages of Cyprus, [[cinnamon]] is added to zivania giving it a distinct red colour, aroma and flavour. When zivania is left to age, it gains stronger flavour and aroma. Aged zivania is highly valued and is kept for consumption during special occasions or as a welcoming treat for visitors.\n\nZivania, in addition to its use as an alcoholic beverage, it is also used to treat wounds, for massaging sore body parts, as a remedy for colds and toothaches, and as a warming-up drink during the cold months of winter, especially in the villages of the [[Troodos mountains]].\n\n==Authenticity==\nTo establish the authenticity of zivania, chemical studies were contacted to investigate which of the metals analyzed constitute diagnostic parameters that establish authenticity. The results of the studies establish that zivania is related to the unique geological and climatic conditions existing on the island of Cyprus.<ref>''Authenticity of the Traditional Cypriot Spirit \"Zivania\" on the Basis of H NMR Spectroscopy Diagnostic Parameters and Statistical Analysis'' [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jafcau/2005/53/i13/abs/jf0495800.html] </ref><ref>''Authenticity of the traditional Cypriot spirit zivania''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14518949&dopt=Abstract]</ref>\n\n==Photos==\n<gallery>\nImage:Zivania.jpg|A bottle of Cypriot Zivania.\nImage:Xynisteri 1.jpg|[[Xynisteri]] grapes used in the production of zivania. \nImage:Mavro.jpg|[[Mavro]] grapes used in the production of zivania.\nImage:Kazani_amira2.jpg|Distillation apparatus (kazani) found in the village of Amiras, [[Crete]].\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pomace brandy]]\n* [[Tsipouro]]\n* [[Tsikoudia]]\n* [[Rakia]]\n* [[Pisco]]\n* [[Grappa]]\n* [[Aguardiente]]\n* [[T\u00f6rk\u00f6lyp\u00e1linka]]\n* [[Chacha (brandy)]]\n* [[Orujo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Alcoholic beverages}}\n{{Cuisine of Greece}}\n[[Category:Greek distilled drinks]]\n[[Category:Cypriot cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pomace brandies]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zivania"}

The travelogue mentions the Barbaroi trading [[frankincense]], among various other commodities, through their port cities such as Avalites (modern Zeila). Competent seamen, the Periplus' author also indicates that they sailed throughout the [[Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aden]] for trade.

According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties consisting of Somalized [[Arabs]] or Arabized Somalis, who also ruled over the similarly-established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the [[Benadir]] region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]].<ref name=\"Lewispohoa\"/>\n[[File:Zayla.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Ruins of the Muslim [[Adal Sultanate|Sultanate of Adal]] in Zeila, Somalia]]\n\nBy the year of (1214-17), [[Ibn Said]] referred to both Zeila and [[Berbera]]. Zeila, as he tells us, was a wealthy city of considerable size and its inhabitants were completely Muslims. [[Ibn Said]]'s description gives the impression that [[Berbera]] was of much more localized importance, mainly serving the immediate [[Somalia|Somali]], hinterland while Zeila was clearly serving more extensive areas. But there is no doubt that Zeila was also predominantly [[Somali people|Somali]], and Al-Dimashqi, another thirteen-century Arab writer, gives the city name its Somali name Awdal (Adal), still known among the local [[Somali people|Somali]]. By the fourteen century, the significance of this [[Somalia|Somali]] port for the Ethiopian interior increased so much so that all the Muslim communities established along the trade routes into central and south-eastern [[Ethiopia]] were commonly known in [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] by the collective term of \"the country of Zeila\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Africa |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&pg=PA139&dq=ibn+sa%27id+zeila&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju-o6CstLfAhV0oXEKHXmwBfgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=ibn%20sa%27id%20zeila&f=false}}</ref> \n\nIn the following century, the [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] historian and traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] describes the city being inhabited by [[Somalis]], followers of the [[Shafi\u2018i]] school, who kept large numbers of camels, sheep and goats.

In 1845, Shermerki deployed a few matchlock men to wrest control of neighboring [[Berbera]] from that town's then feuding Somali authorities. This alarmed the Emir of Harar, who, having already been at loggerheads with Shermerki over fiscal matters, was concerned about the ramifications that these movements might ultimately have on his own city's commerce.

During the war, Imam Ahmad pioneered the use of [[cannon]]s supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire]], which he imported through Zeila and deployed against Abyssinian forces and their Portuguese allies led by [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]].<ref name=\"Lewisapd\"/> Some scholars argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of [[firearm]]s like the [[matchlock]] [[musket]], cannons and the [[arquebus]] over traditional weapons.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''Cambridge Illustrated Atlas, Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution'', 1492\u20131792, (Cambridge University Press: 1996), p.9.</ref>\n\nTravellers' reports, such as the memoirs of the Italian [[Ludovico di Varthema]], indicate that Zeila continued to be an important marketplace during the 16th century,<ref>\"There is an abundance of provisions in this city, and there are many merchants here.\" ''The Travels of Ludovico di Varthema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia Deserta and Arabia Felix, in Persia, India, and Ethiopia, A.D. 1503 to 1508'', translated by John Winter Jone, and edited by George Percy Badger (London: the Hakluyt Society, 1863), p. 87</ref> despite being sacked by the Portuguese in 1517 and 1528. Later that century, separate raids by [[nomad]]s from the interior eventually prompted the port's then ruler, Garad Lado, to enlist the services of 'Atlya ibn Muhammad to construct a sturdy wall around the city.<ref name=\"Pankhurst2\">{{cite book|last=Pankhurst|first=Richard|title=History of Ethiopian towns from the Middle Ages to the early nineteenth century|year=1982|publisher=Steiner|isbn=3515032045|page=63}}</ref> Zeila, however, ultimately began to decline in importance following the short-lived conquest of Abyssinia.<ref name=\"Lewisapd\"/>\n\n16th century Zeila, along with several other settlements on the East African coast, had been visited by the Portuguese explorer and writer [[Duarte Barbosa]], describing the city as such: \"Having passed this town of Berbara, and going on, entering the Red Sea, there is another town of the Moors, which is named Zeyla, which is a good place of trade, whither many ships navigate and sell their cloths and merchandise. It is very populous, with good houses of stone and white-wash, and good streets ; the houses are covered with terraces, the dwellers in them are black. They have many horses, and breed much cattle of all sorts, which they make use of for milk, and butter, and meat. There is in this country abundance of wheat, millet, barley, and fruits, which they carry thence to Aden.\" <ref>Dames, L., 1918: [https://archive.org/stream/descriptionofcoa00barbrich/descriptionofcoa00barbrich_djvu.txt ''The Book of Duarte Barbosa''] London: Hakluyt Society</ref>\n\n===Yemenite period===\nBeginning in 1630, the city became a dependency of the ruler of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]], who, for a small sum, leased the port to one of the office-holders of Mocha. The latter in return collected a toll on its trade. Zeila was subsequently ruled by an Emir, whom Mordechai Abir suggested had \"some vague claim to authority over all of the ''sahil'', but whose real authority did not extend very far beyond the walls of the town.\" Assisted by cannons and a few mercenaries armed with [[matchlock]]s, the governor succeeded in fending off incursions by both the disunited nomads of the interior, who had penetrated the area, as well as brigands in the Gulf of Aden.<ref>{{cite book |last= Abir|first= Mordechai |title= Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769\u20131855)|year= 1968|publisher= Longmans|location= London|page = 15}} Abir defines the ''sahil'' as \"the coast\", which stretched from the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] to [[Cape Guardafui]]</ref> By the first half of the 19th century, Zeila was a shadow of its former self, having been reduced to \"a large village surrounded by a low mud wall, with a population that varied according to the season from 1,000 to 3,000 people.\"<ref>Abir, ''Era of the Princes'', p. 14</ref> The city continued to serve as the principal maritime outlet for Harar and beyond it in [[Shewa]]. However, the opening of a new sea route between [[Tadjoura]] and Shewa cut further into Zeila's historic position as the main regional port.<ref>Abir, ''Era of the Princes'', p. 16</ref>\n\n===Ottoman period===\n{{main|Ottoman Zeila}}\n\nAlthough part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] since 1559, between 1821 and 1841, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], [[Pasha]] of [[Egypt]], came to control Yemen and the ''sahil'', with Zeila included.<ref name=\"Clifford\">E.

Shermerki's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the [[Ogaden]]. In 1845, Shermerki deployed a few matchlock men to wrest control of neighboring [[Berbera]] from that town's then feuding Somali authorities. This alarmed the Emir of Harar, who, having already been at loggerheads with Shermerki over fiscal matters, was concerned about the ramifications that these movements might ultimately have on his own city's commerce. The Emir consequently urged Berbera's leaders to reconcile and mount a resistance against Shermerki's troops.<ref name=\"Abir\">{{cite book|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|title=Ethiopia: the era of the princes: the challenge of Islam and re-unification of the Christian Empire, 1769\u20131855|year=1968|publisher=Praeger|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qo1yAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> Shermerki was later succeeded as Governor of Zeila by Abu Bakr Pasha, a local Afar statesman.<ref name=\"Lewismhs\">I.M.

At the same time, the Egyptians received British recognition of their nominal jurisdiction as far east as [[Cape Guardafui]].<ref name=\"Clifford\"/> In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years (1870\u201384). When the Egyptian garrison in Harar was evacuated in 1885, Zeila became caught up in the competition between the Tadjoura-based French and the British for control of the strategic Gulf of Aden littoral. I. M. Lewis mentions that \"by the end of 1885 Britain was preparing to resist an expected French landing at Zeila.\"<ref name=\"Lewismhs\"/> However, the two powers decided instead to turn to negotiations.\n\n===British Somaliland===\n{{main|British Somaliland}}\n[[File:Burallehroble.jpg|thumb|Buralleh (Buralli) Robleh, Sub-Inspector of Police of Zeila, and General Gordon, Governor of [[British Somaliland]], in Zeila (1921).]]\nOn 9 February 1888, France and Britain concluded an agreement defining the boundary between their respective [[protectorate]]s.<ref>Simon Imbert-Vier, ''Fronti\u00e8res et limites \u00e0 Djibouti durant la p\u00e9riode coloniale (1884\u20131977)'', Universit\u00e9 de Provence, Aix-Marseille, 2008, p. 81.</ref> As a result, Zeila and its eastern neighbor Berbera came to be part of [[British Somaliland]].\n\nThe construction of a railway from [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] to [[Addis Ababa]] in the late 19th century continued the neglect of Zeila.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref> At the beginning of the next century, the city was described in the ''[[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' as having a \"good sheltered [[anchor]]age much frequented by Arab sailing craft. However, heavy draught steamers are obliged to anchor a mile and a half from the shore. Small coasting boats lie off the pier and there is no difficulty in loading or discharging cargo. The water supply of the town is drawn from the wells of Takosha, about three miles distant; every morning camels, in charge of old Somali women and bearing goatskins filled with water, come into the town in picturesque procession. ... [Zeila's] imports, which reach Zaila chiefly via Aden, are mainly [[cotton]] goods, [[rice]], [[jowaree]], [[date palm|dates]] and [[silk]]; the exports, 90% of which are from Abyssinia, are principally [[Coffee production in Ethiopia|coffee]], skins, [[ivory]], [[cattle]], [[ghee]] and [[mother-of-pearl]]\".<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn August 1940, Zeila was [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|captured]] by advancing Italian troops.

It broadcasts 19 markets throughout mainland New Zealand via terrestrial [[FM broadcasting|FM]], and worldwide via the Internet. The network targets the 15\u201339 demographic specialises in a chart-music playlist of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Modern rock|rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and dance music. It reaches approximately 486,800 listeners weekly, making it the fifth largest commercial radio station in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.trb.co.nz/results-national.html]</ref>\n\nThe ZM network as it is today was founded in the early 1970s as three separate commercial music stations owned by [[Radio New Zealand]] in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]]. The name is derived from the former callsigns of the stations: 1ZM, 2ZM and 3ZM. Z denoted a Radio New Zealand commercial station and M stood for Music. The stations were carved off to The Radio Network (now merged into New Zealand Media and Entertainment) in 1996, and ZM spread across the country, originally as three separate networks before finally merging to form one nationwide network in 2000.\n\nThe network's head office and main studios are based in Auckland, where all of the programming is produced.\n\n==ZM History==\n\n===Early Years===\n*ZM in its current format was first started in 1973 by the government owned [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] (which became [[Radio New Zealand]] in 1975). The three original ZM stations were based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch and had been on air for the past few decades most recently as 1YD, 2YD and 3ZM in their respective markets.\n*The three original stations were known by their ZM call signs, [[1ZM (New Zealand)|1ZM]] in Auckland on 1250AM, [[2ZM]] in Wellington on 1130AM and [[3ZM]] in Christchurch on 1400AM.\n*In 1978 the AM frequency step in New Zealand was changed from a 10&nbsp;kHz step to a 9&nbsp;kHz step as a result all three stations changed frequencies. 1ZM moved to 1251&nbsp;kHz, 2ZM Wellington moved to 1161&nbsp;kHz but sometimes branded as 1162ZM and 3ZM Christchurch moved to 1323&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===1980s===\n\n====Overnight programming====\n*In 1981, Radio New Zealand stations were finally granted the right to broadcast 24 hours per day; previously only the domain of private operators. Overnight networked programming was introduced with the ZM All-Nighter show. Programming was produced from the 1ZM studios in Auckland and networked to 2ZM Wellington and 3ZM Christchurch. [[Classic Rock 96FM (Hawkes Bay)|2ZK]] in Hawkes Bay and [[Hokonui Gold|4ZG]] in Gore also took the ZM All-Nighter. Programming was also networked to the ZMFM station introduced in Palmerston North in 1987. The show was offered as an 'alternative music choice to the top 40-based formats offered by the private stations and was originally hosted by Barry Jenkin from Auckland. With his departure in 1983, the alternative format remained, but the music played was more top-40-based with the large percentage of NZ music. In 1987 with 1ZM dropping the ZM brand name The ZM All Nighter became known as \"The All Nighter\" on all stations. In 1989 The All Nighter was discontinued and stations that previously took this show now ran local shows or an automated show with no announcer.\n\n====Auckland 1ZM becomes Classic Hits====\n* In 1982, 1ZM Auckland lost its bid for an FM license and with the Broadcasting Tribunal allowing two new private radio stations ([[91FM (Auckland)|Magic 91FM]] and [[89FM (Auckland)|89 Stereo FM]]) into the Auckland market, 1ZM was required to re format and adopt a 'Limited Sponsorship' model in place of its full commercial licence. This was an attempt to assist the new operators in establishing a revenue base. For 1ZM this meant that although the station could still run paid-for advertisements, those messages could not have music underneath, mention price or be longer than 25 words. Within 2\u20133 years, both 1ZM's financial and audience market share dropped significantly as advertisers and young listeners were attracted by the higher quality sound of the FM stations, despite the absence of long commercial breaks on 1ZM. 1ZM at the time promoted itself as \"Total Music ZM\" to emphasise the limited commercial format.\n* By 1987 1ZM Auckland was still a limited commercial station. A decision was made to change the format of 1ZM from a [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] format to a [[Classic Hits]] format. The Auckland station was rebranded as ''Classic Hits Twelve 51'' which subsequently marked the birth of the [[Classic Hits FM|Classic Hits]] brand which would be rolled out across New Zealand years later.\n* In 1989 Auckland's Classic Hits Twelve 51 was finally given a licence to broadcast on FM and broadcast commercials. The station launched on 97.4FM as ''Classic Hits 97FM.'' The 1251&nbsp;kHz frequency licence was transferred to Christian broadcaster [[Radio Rhema]]. In 1993 the format of ''Classic Hits 97FM'' was rolled out across New Zealand with local stations operated by Radio New Zealand taking on the same format and branding, ultimately all these stations became [[The Hits (New Zealand)|The Hits]] network in 2014.\n\n====Wellington 2ZM and Christchurch 3ZM switch to FM====\n*The ZM stations in Auckland and Wellington were not affected by the changes made to Auckland station. In 1985 2ZM Wellington switched to FM broadcasting on 90.9FM and in 1986 Christchurch also made the move to FM broadcasting on 91.3FM. Following the change, both stations rebranded to become ''Hit Radio ZMFM''. \n*In 1987 a ZMFM station was established in Palmerston North on 90.6FM with a local breakfast show, but all programming outside breakfast was networked from Wellington. This station became a local station in 1989 now branded as [[Classic Rock Q91FM|2QQ]].\n*In 1989 ZMFM Christchurch became known as ''91 Stereo ZM'' and later ''91ZM''.\n\n===1990s===\n\n====Branding====\n*Both 91ZM Christchurch and ZMFM Wellington used the slogan \"Rock of the Nineties\" during the early 1990s. In 1994 ZMFM Wellington was rebranded to ''91ZM'' using the same logo as 91ZM Christchurch. Both stations changed the slogan to \"Just Great Music of the 80s and 90s\".\n*In 1997 ZM changed their logo on all stations to include a green globe behind the station name. At the same time the station slogan was changed to ''Today's Hit Music'' reflecting the modern music played on the station, this slogan was used until 2014.\n\n====Privatisation====\n*In July 1996 the [[New Zealand Government]] sold off the commercial arm of [[Radio New Zealand]], which included, among other things, the ZM stations. The new owner was [[The Radio Network]], a subsidiary of [[APN News & Media]] and [[Clear Channel Communications]], which operated as a division of the [[Australian Radio Network]].<ref name=expansion>{{cite news|title=Radio Network says expansion possible|publisher=[[The Christchurch Press]]|date=21 September 1996|page=29}}</ref>\n\n====Expansion and early network programming==== \n*A new ZM station was established in Northland in 1995 as 93ZM this station was a completely local station at this point.\n*The very first networked ZM station was established in Dunedin in 1996 as [[96ZM]], this station was networked from [[ZM Christchurch|91ZM]] studios in Christchurch using an automated computer system allowing announcers in Christchurch to produce localised voice breaks for Dunedin recorded minutes earlier. On air announcers called the station Dunedin's 96ZM but during shows with a high amount of talk such as breakfast one voice break was produced for both Dunedin and Christchurch where the station was simply called ZM.  \n*In 1997 programming was extended to Invercargill on 95.6FM as 96ZM, networked from 91ZM Christchurch with localised voice breaks, the same as 96ZM Dunedin. Also in 1997 ZM returned to Palmerston North on the 90.6FM frequency that had been used to broadcast ZMFM to Palmerston North in the late 1980s. 91ZM Palmerston North took network programming from 91ZM Wellington with localised voice breaks similar to Dunedin and Invercargill.\n*In late 1996 The Radio Network purchased the assets of Prospect Media, which included [[Radio Hauraki]] and [[Easy Mix|Easy Listening i]]. The sale also included local stations in Auckland and Hamilton which at the time were both branded as [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]], and were separately owned from The Breeze station in Wellington. In 1997 both The Breeze in Auckland and Hamilton were closed down and a new local ZM station was started in Auckland on 91.0FM as ''91ZM'', a ZM station was also started on 89.8FM in Hamilton as ''89.8ZM''\n*In 1997 local programming was dropped on 93ZM Northland excluding the breakfast show with all other programming becoming networked from Auckland. The Northland breakfast team were moved to Hamilton in 1998 with programming networked back to Northland, at other times both stations carried 91ZM Auckland programming.\n*Programming was extended to Rotorua in 1998 as 98ZM replacing local station [[Classic Rock 98.3FM (Rotorua)|Classic Rock 98.3FM]], initially a local ZM station but later networked from Auckland. A new station was also established in Taranaki as 98.8ZM.\n*In 1999 programming was extended to Hawkes Bay on the former [[Radio Hauraki]] 95.9FM frequency. Previously this frequency was used for [[Classic Rock 96FM (Hawkes Bay)|Classic Rock 96FM]].\n*Nationwide networked programming was introduced in 1997 first with the ZM Essential 30 Countdown on Saturday afternoons. Shortly after the ZM Club Mix was introduced on Saturday nights.\n*A nationwide night show was introduced on weeknights in 1998, 91ZM Christchurch announcer Willy Macalister was moved to Auckland to present this show.\n\n===2000s===\n\n====Nationwide Network programming====\n*By 2000 ZM was broadcasting in Invercargill and Dunedin networked from Christchurch, Palmerston North networked from Wellington and had established a northern network with Hawkes Bay, Rotorua, Taranaki, Waikato and Northland all receiving networked programming from Auckland. The Waikato programme could also be heard in the Bay of Plenty.\n*In 2000 ZM changed to a single network format, all ZM stations in smaller regions became part of this network based from Auckland the only regions not originally affected were Christchurch and Wellington where these stations remained local except during the evenings and overnight where ZM ran a nationwide night show. Voice breaks that were previously prerecorded for each region and targeted towards the local audience were replaced with live voice breaks tailored to a nationwide audience. At first, these changes were not popular particularly in regions where the announcer lineup changed due to receiving the Auckland-based ZM station instead of the Wellington or Christchurch based station. The original nationwide network lineup consisted of [[Marcus Lush]] on breakfast with ''The Marcus Lush breakfast show'', [[Nicki Sunderland]] and [[Lana Coc-Kroft]] presenting the daytime show, Mike McClung and Tim Homer presenting drive and [[Geoff Stagg]] on nights. \n*In 2001 more changes were made and this time Christchurch and Wellington were integrated into the network. The Christchurch studio was closed altogether with 91ZM Christchurch drive announcer Jason Royal and producer Jason Winstanley (Staino) moved to Auckland to present a nationwide drive show. Wellington ZM remained local but local Wellington breakfast announcers [[Pauline Gillespie]], [[Nick Tansley]] and [[Grant Kareama]] became the hosts of a new nationwide breakfast show still presented from Wellington. At first some breakfast show content in Wellington varied to the rest of the country such as separate news bulletins and the final hour of the show only being heard in Wellington, by 2002 the breakfast show was the same in all regions.\n*In 2003 more changes were made to the announcer lineup. The Radio Network hired [[shock jock]] [[Iain Stables]] to present the ZM drive show with Jason Royal moved to the daytime show. Former [[2XS FM]] Palmerston North announcer [[Stu Tolan]] was hired to present the night show and later [[Jacqui Jenson]] became co-host. Later in 2003 the amount of local content on ZM in Wellington was reduced after Wellington drive announcer Julian Burn left, and he was not replaced but instead the nationwide drive show, then hosted by Iain Stables, was networked into Wellington. Local weekend programming in Wellington was also reduced in 2005.\n*In 2005 the ZM Christchurch studio was reopened and ZM was local in Christchurch during the Daytime (10 am\u20133 pm), as well as between 10 am\u20132 pm on Saturdays. The Daytime 10 am\u20133 pm announcer in Auckland produced two separate shows simultaneously, one exclusively for Auckland and another for the rest of the ZM Network, a technique used by various other Auckland radio stations including [[Classic Hits FM]], [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] & Coast.\n*At the end of 2008 Wellington dropped its local daytime and Saturday brunch show and now takes the network versions of these shows, and exactly the same changes affected ZM Christchurch during the middle of 2009. This saw the Christchurch studio facing closure, however the Wellington studio remained until 2014 as it housed the nationwide [[ZM Morning Crew]] then presented by Polly and Grant.\n* Several new stations have been set up to carry network programming. Early network stations include ZM Gisborne in 2002, ZM Wanganui in 2004, and ZM South Canterbury in September 2004. Later network stations include ZM Wairarapa in 2010, ZM Taupo in 2013 and ZM Queenstown in May 2014.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:ZM'S 2011 logo.jpg|thumb]]\n\n====Launch of online content====\n*Early internet streams of ZM date back to the late 1990s when 91ZM Wellington had an internet stream available on their website. For most of the 2000s the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch stations could be streamed online. In December 2010, the station launched a new online stream of ZM, where in a New Zealand radio first, the stream became the 20th ZM station to connect to the network in the same way regional markets do. The change meant ZM Online now had its own imaging & commercials. Local ads, weather and traffic were removed from the online station.\n*ZM launched its own [[iPhone]] App in 2011. The app displayed all of the ZM website content, and also streamed the station live. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app was later launched.\n*In line with all TRN stations ZM became available on [[iHeartRadio]] after its New Zealand launch in August 2013.\n\n====Change in format and announcer lineup====\n*In April 2014 it was announced that long standing breakfast hosts Polly Gillespie & Grant Kereama (Over 20 Years in Wellington Market & 13 Years Nationally) were stepping aside from the station in order to continue their show on the new Radio Network station The Hits. Their last show on the station was on 24 April. Their replacements were immediately announced as the high profile signings of Carl Fletcher, Vaughan Smith & Megan Sellers who defected from rival station The Edge.\n*In April 2014 Carl Fletcher, Vaughan Smith & Megan Sellers commenced their new breakfast show across the ZM network named The Fletch, Vaughan & Megan Show.\n*The show shuffle also saw the Ad-Free 50s being dropped.\n*The ZM30 (formerly the daily ZM20) on Juice TV hosted by Guy and Georgia Saturday 6pm and Sunday 9am finished screening when Juice was replaced by Garage TV on May 15, 2015\n*Jay and Flynny finished their show on 19 December 2014 after six years together and Flynny being on ZM for over a decade. They were replaced by Jase & PJ. \n*In December 2016, it was announced that The Night Show with Guy and Georgia would be replaced by The ZM Snapchart with Cam Mansel.\n*At the end of 2017, Jase & PJ departed the drive show. Until July 2018 the ZM Drive show consisted of edited best bits of their Breakfast show from Australia on [[KIIS 101.1]].\n*In July 2018, Bree & Clint replaced the pre-recorded best bits of Jase & PJ. The Jase & PJ highlight clip show has been moved to Saturday and Sunday mornings from 6am - 9am.\n\n==Programmes==\n===Fletch, Vaughan & Megan===\nThe breakfast show is presented by Carl \"Fletch\" Fletcher, Vaughan Smith and Megan Sellers with producers Anna Henvest and Georgia Burt. The show runs from 6:00am to 9:00am. News and sport sourced from the NZME newsroom is heard on the hour, along with local weather, read out live by Henvest. Fletch, Vaughan and Megan have presented the breakfast show since 2014.\n\nPreviously this show was presented by [[Pauline 'Polly' Gillespie]] and [[Grant Kareama]] from Wellington between 2001 and 2014. The original networked breakfast show was presented by [[Marcus Lush]].\n\n===ZM's 90 minute Non-Stop Jams===\nEvery weekday from 9am to 10:30am, there is 90 minutes of music without ads or voice breaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zmonline.com/shows/zms-90-minute-non-stop-jams/|title=ZM's 90 minute Non-Stop Jams|last=www.zmonline.com|website=ZM|language=en|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Jam Packed Workday with Georgia===\nThe workday show is presented by Georgia Burt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zmonline.com/shows/jam-packed-workday-with-georgia/|title=Jam Packed Workday with Georgia|last=www.zmonline.com|first=ZM {{!}}|website=ZM|language=en|access-date=2019-09-08}}</ref> The show runs from 10:30am to 3:00pm. On Fridays, Georgia hosts the 'Friday Jams' show which plays old school R&B hits.

It became the 20th ZM station to connect to the network in the same way regional markets do. This gave ZMonline its own imaging & commercial options.\n\nLocal ads, weather and traffic are removed from the online station (as these are available on demand for every market inside the ZM iPhone and android apps). At the moment through every second commercial break the station plays a song.\n\n===ZM News Service===\nLike most radio stations in New Zealand ZM originally featured news on the hour every hour originally news was provided by the Radio New Zealand News Service, following the sale of the Radio New Zealand commercial service this became The Radio Network News Service. In 1997 ZM stations began reducing news breaks to only play on the breakfast show, this was at time when some radio stations began increasing the amount of music played in an hour and reducing talk. In 2000 ZM started their own news service called ''ZM Newsbeat''.\n\nZM News (formally called Newsbeat and Newsfeed) has news reports read out live followed by a local weather forecast prerecorded from the Auckland studio for each individual region. The bulletins are sourced from the NZME newsroom, and air hourly between 6 am-8 am weekdays with Anna Henvest, and weather hourly 4 pm-6 pm weekdays with Adam Cooper, with news and weather hourly 7 am-10am during the weekend and public holidays. An exclusive Wellington edition of ''ZM Newsbeat'' was aired during the Morning Crew's show up until early 2006, when it was dropped for the national edition. In April 2014 Newsbeat was renamed to Newsfeed coinciding with the re-launch of ZM, at the same time the Newsfeed service was introduced on [[The Hits (New Zealand)|The Hits]] with the former ZM news readers moved over to The Hits.\n\nTraffic reports are read out on air from The Radio Network Auckland studios for larger regions in New Zealand, for Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton, Tauranga and Dunedin. Other stations play advertisements during these times. Wellington originally ran their own local traffic reports until 2006.\n\nWeather is read out on weekdays following news bulletins. Individual weather reports are pre-recorded for each region and updated with each show. When the Morning Crew were based in Wellington, they read out the Wellington weather live during the breakfast show, while the pre-recorded reports by the newsreader air over the rest of the network.\n\n==ZM in the New Zealand Radio Awards==\nZM and ZM announcers have won the following awards at the [[New Zealand Radio Awards]]:\n\n===2005===\n*Special Commendation went to announcer Sarah Gandy for the ''ZM Sealed Section'' in the category ''Best Daily Or Weekly Series''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://radiostationworld.com/locations/New_Zealand/radio-awards_2005.asp |title=2005 Radio Award Finalist|publisher=RadioStationWorld -

It broadcasts 19 markets throughout mainland New Zealand via terrestrial [[FM broadcasting|FM]], and worldwide via the Internet. The network targets the 15\u201339 demographic specialises in a chart-music playlist of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Modern rock|rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and dance music. It reaches approximately 486,800 listeners weekly, making it the fifth largest commercial radio station in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.trb.co.nz/results-national.html]</ref>\n\nThe ZM network as it is today was founded in the early 1970s as three separate commercial music stations owned by [[Radio New Zealand]] in [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]]. The name is derived from the former callsigns of the stations: 1ZM, 2ZM and 3ZM. Z denoted a Radio New Zealand commercial station and M stood for Music. The stations were carved off to The Radio Network (now merged into New Zealand Media and Entertainment) in 1996, and ZM spread across the country, originally as three separate networks before finally merging to form one nationwide network in 2000.\n\nThe network's head office and main studios are based in Auckland, where all of the programming is produced.\n\n==ZM History==\n\n===Early Years===\n*ZM in its current format was first started in 1973 by the government owned [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] (which became [[Radio New Zealand]] in 1975). The three original ZM stations were based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch and had been on air for the past few decades most recently as 1YD, 2YD and 3ZM in their respective markets.\n*The three original stations were known by their ZM call signs, [[1ZM (New Zealand)|1ZM]] in Auckland on 1250AM, [[2ZM]] in Wellington on 1130AM and [[3ZM]] in Christchurch on 1400AM.\n*In 1978 the AM frequency step in New Zealand was changed from a 10&nbsp;kHz step to a 9&nbsp;kHz step as a result all three stations changed frequencies. 1ZM moved to 1251&nbsp;kHz, 2ZM Wellington moved to 1161&nbsp;kHz but sometimes branded as 1162ZM and 3ZM Christchurch moved to 1323&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===1980s===\n\n====Overnight programming====\n*In 1981, Radio New Zealand stations were finally granted the right to broadcast 24 hours per day; previously only the domain of private operators. Overnight networked programming was introduced with the ZM All-Nighter show. Programming was produced from the 1ZM studios in Auckland and networked to 2ZM Wellington and 3ZM Christchurch. [[Classic Rock 96FM (Hawkes Bay)|2ZK]] in Hawkes Bay and [[Hokonui Gold|4ZG]] in Gore also took the ZM All-Nighter. Programming was also networked to the ZMFM station introduced in Palmerston North in 1987. The show was offered as an 'alternative music choice to the top 40-based formats offered by the private stations and was originally hosted by Barry Jenkin from Auckland. With his departure in 1983, the alternative format remained, but the music played was more top-40-based with the large percentage of NZ music. In 1987 with 1ZM dropping the ZM brand name The ZM All Nighter became known as \"The All Nighter\" on all stations. In 1989 The All Nighter was discontinued and stations that previously took this show now ran local shows or an automated show with no announcer.\n\n====Auckland 1ZM becomes Classic Hits====\n* In 1982, 1ZM Auckland lost its bid for an FM license and with the Broadcasting Tribunal allowing two new private radio stations ([[91FM (Auckland)|Magic 91FM]] and [[89FM (Auckland)|89 Stereo FM]]) into the Auckland market, 1ZM was required to re format and adopt a 'Limited Sponsorship' model in place of its full commercial licence. This was an attempt to assist the new operators in establishing a revenue base. For 1ZM this meant that although the station could still run paid-for advertisements, those messages could not have music underneath, mention price or be longer than 25 words. Within 2\u20133 years, both 1ZM's financial and audience market share dropped significantly as advertisers and young listeners were attracted by the higher quality sound of the FM stations, despite the absence of long commercial breaks on 1ZM. 1ZM at the time promoted itself as \"Total Music ZM\" to emphasise the limited commercial format.\n* By 1987 1ZM Auckland was still a limited commercial station. A decision was made to change the format of 1ZM from a [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] format to a [[Classic Hits]] format. The Auckland station was rebranded as ''Classic Hits Twelve 51'' which subsequently marked the birth of the [[Classic Hits FM|Classic Hits]] brand which would be rolled out across New Zealand years later.\n* In 1989 Auckland's Classic Hits Twelve 51 was finally given a licence to broadcast on FM and broadcast commercials. The station launched on 97.4FM as ''Classic Hits 97FM.'' The 1251&nbsp;kHz frequency licence was transferred to Christian broadcaster [[Radio Rhema]]. In 1993 the format of ''Classic Hits 97FM'' was rolled out across New Zealand with local stations operated by Radio New Zealand taking on the same format and branding, ultimately all these stations became [[The Hits (New Zealand)|The Hits]] network in 2014.\n\n====Wellington 2ZM and Christchurch 3ZM switch to FM====\n*The ZM stations in Auckland and Wellington were not affected by the changes made to Auckland station. In 1985 2ZM Wellington switched to FM broadcasting on 90.9FM and in 1986 Christchurch also made the move to FM broadcasting on 91.3FM. Following the change, both stations rebranded to become ''Hit Radio ZMFM''. \n*In 1987 a ZMFM station was established in Palmerston North on 90.6FM with a local breakfast show, but all programming outside breakfast was networked from Wellington. This station became a local station in 1989 now branded as [[Classic Rock Q91FM|2QQ]].\n*In 1989 ZMFM Christchurch became known as ''91 Stereo ZM'' and later ''91ZM''.\n\n===1990s===\n\n====Branding====\n*Both 91ZM Christchurch and ZMFM Wellington used the slogan \"Rock of the Nineties\" during the early 1990s. In 1994 ZMFM Wellington was rebranded to ''91ZM'' using the same logo as 91ZM Christchurch. Both stations changed the slogan to \"Just Great Music of the 80s and 90s\".\n*In 1997 ZM changed their logo on all stations to include a green globe behind the station name. At the same time the station slogan was changed to ''Today's Hit Music'' reflecting the modern music played on the station, this slogan was used until 2014.\n\n====Privatisation====\n*In July 1996 the [[New Zealand Government]] sold off the commercial arm of [[Radio New Zealand]], which included, among other things, the ZM stations. The new owner was [[The Radio Network]], a subsidiary of [[APN News & Media]] and [[Clear Channel Communications]], which operated as a division of the [[Australian Radio Network]].<ref name=expansion>{{cite news|title=Radio Network says expansion possible|publisher=[[The Christchurch Press]]|date=21 September 1996|page=29}}</ref>\n\n====Expansion and early network programming==== \n*A new ZM station was established in Northland in 1995 as 93ZM this station was a completely local station at this point.\n*The very first networked ZM station was established in Dunedin in 1996 as [[96ZM]], this station was networked from [[ZM Christchurch|91ZM]] studios in Christchurch using an automated computer system allowing announcers in Christchurch to produce localised voice breaks for Dunedin recorded minutes earlier. On air announcers called the station Dunedin's 96ZM but during shows with a high amount of talk such as breakfast one voice break was produced for both Dunedin and Christchurch where the station was simply called ZM.  \n*In 1997 programming was extended to Invercargill on 95.6FM as 96ZM, networked from 91ZM Christchurch with localised voice breaks, the same as 96ZM Dunedin. Also in 1997 ZM returned to Palmerston North on the 90.6FM frequency that had been used to broadcast ZMFM to Palmerston North in the late 1980s. 91ZM Palmerston North took network programming from 91ZM Wellington with localised voice breaks similar to Dunedin and Invercargill.\n*In late 1996 The Radio Network purchased the assets of Prospect Media, which included [[Radio Hauraki]] and [[Easy Mix|Easy Listening i]]. The sale also included local stations in Auckland and Hamilton which at the time were both branded as [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]], and were separately owned from The Breeze station in Wellington. In 1997 both The Breeze in Auckland and Hamilton were closed down and a new local ZM station was started in Auckland on 91.0FM as ''91ZM'', a ZM station was also started on 89.8FM in Hamilton as ''89.8ZM''\n*In 1997 local programming was dropped on 93ZM Northland excluding the breakfast show with all other programming becoming networked from Auckland. The Northland breakfast team were moved to Hamilton in 1998 with programming networked back to Northland, at other times both stations carried 91ZM Auckland programming.\n*Programming was extended to Rotorua in 1998 as 98ZM replacing local station [[Classic Rock 98.3FM (Rotorua)|Classic Rock 98.3FM]], initially a local ZM station but later networked from Auckland. A new station was also established in Taranaki as 98.8ZM.\n*In 1999 programming was extended to Hawkes Bay on the former [[Radio Hauraki]] 95.9FM frequency. Previously this frequency was used for [[Classic Rock 96FM (Hawkes Bay)|Classic Rock 96FM]].\n*Nationwide networked programming was introduced in 1997 first with the ZM Essential 30 Countdown on Saturday afternoons. Shortly after the ZM Club Mix was introduced on Saturday nights.\n*A nationwide night show was introduced on weeknights in 1998, 91ZM Christchurch announcer Willy Macalister was moved to Auckland to present this show.\n\n===2000s===\n\n====Nationwide Network programming====\n*By 2000 ZM was broadcasting in Invercargill and Dunedin networked from Christchurch, Palmerston North networked from Wellington and had established a northern network with Hawkes Bay, Rotorua, Taranaki, Waikato and Northland all receiving networked programming from Auckland. The Waikato programme could also be heard in the Bay of Plenty.\n*In 2000 ZM changed to a single network format, all ZM stations in smaller regions became part of this network based from Auckland the only regions not originally affected were Christchurch and Wellington where these stations remained local except during the evenings and overnight where ZM ran a nationwide night show. Voice breaks that were previously prerecorded for each region and targeted towards the local audience were replaced with live voice breaks tailored to a nationwide audience. At first, these changes were not popular particularly in regions where the announcer lineup changed due to receiving the Auckland-based ZM station instead of the Wellington or Christchurch based station. The original nationwide network lineup consisted of [[Marcus Lush]] on breakfast with ''The Marcus Lush breakfast show'', [[Nicki Sunderland]] and [[Lana Coc-Kroft]] presenting the daytime show, Mike McClung and Tim Homer presenting drive and [[Geoff Stagg]] on nights. \n*In 2001 more changes were made and this time Christchurch and Wellington were integrated into the network. The Christchurch studio was closed altogether with 91ZM Christchurch drive announcer Jason Royal and producer Jason Winstanley (Staino) moved to Auckland to present a nationwide drive show. Wellington ZM remained local but local Wellington breakfast announcers [[Pauline Gillespie]], [[Nick Tansley]] and [[Grant Kareama]] became the hosts of a new nationwide breakfast show still presented from Wellington. At first some breakfast show content in Wellington varied to the rest of the country such as separate news bulletins and the final hour of the show only being heard in Wellington, by 2002 the breakfast show was the same in all regions.\n*In 2003 more changes were made to the announcer lineup. The Radio Network hired [[shock jock]] [[Iain Stables]] to present the ZM drive show with Jason Royal moved to the daytime show. Former [[2XS FM]] Palmerston North announcer [[Stu Tolan]] was hired to present the night show and later [[Jacqui Jenson]] became co-host. Later in 2003 the amount of local content on ZM in Wellington was reduced after Wellington drive announcer Julian Burn left, and he was not replaced but instead the nationwide drive show, then hosted by Iain Stables, was networked into Wellington. Local weekend programming in Wellington was also reduced in 2005.\n*In 2005 the ZM Christchurch studio was reopened and ZM was local in Christchurch during the Daytime (10 am\u20133 pm), as well as between 10 am\u20132 pm on Saturdays. The Daytime 10 am\u20133 pm announcer in Auckland produced two separate shows simultaneously, one exclusively for Auckland and another for the rest of the ZM Network, a technique used by various other Auckland radio stations including [[Classic Hits FM]], [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] & Coast.\n*At the end of 2008 Wellington dropped its local daytime and Saturday brunch show and now takes the network versions of these shows, and exactly the same changes affected ZM Christchurch during the middle of 2009. This saw the Christchurch studio facing closure, however the Wellington studio remained until 2014 as it housed the nationwide [[ZM Morning Crew]] then presented by Polly and Grant.\n* Several new stations have been set up to carry network programming. Early network stations include ZM Gisborne in 2002, ZM Wanganui in 2004, and ZM South Canterbury in September 2004. Later network stations include ZM Wairarapa in 2010, ZM Taupo in 2013 and ZM Queenstown in May 2014.\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:ZM'S 2011 logo.jpg|thumb]]\n\n====Launch of online content====\n*Early internet streams of ZM date back to the late 1990s when 91ZM Wellington had an internet stream available on their website. For most of the 2000s the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch stations could be streamed online. In December 2010, the station launched a new online stream of ZM, where in a New Zealand radio first, the stream became the 20th ZM station to connect to the network in the same way regional markets do. The change meant ZM Online now had its own imaging & commercials. Local ads, weather and traffic were removed from the online station.\n*ZM launched its own [[iPhone]] App in 2011. The app displayed all of the ZM website content, and also streamed the station live. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app was later launched.\n*In line with all TRN stations ZM became available on [[iHeartRadio]] after its New Zealand launch in August 2013.\n\n====Change in format and announcer lineup====\n*In April 2014 it was announced that long standing breakfast hosts Polly Gillespie & Grant Kereama (Over 20 Years in Wellington Market & 13 Years Nationally) were stepping aside from the station in order to continue their show on the new Radio Network station The Hits. Their last show on the station was on 24 April. Their replacements were immediately announced as the high profile signings of Carl Fletcher, Vaughan Smith & Megan Sellers who defected from rival station The Edge.\n*In April 2014 Carl Fletcher, Vaughan Smith & Megan Sellers commenced their new breakfast show across the ZM network named The Fletch, Vaughan & Megan Show.\n*The show shuffle also saw the Ad-Free 50s being dropped.\n*The ZM30 (formerly the daily ZM20) on Juice TV hosted by Guy and Georgia Saturday 6pm and Sunday 9am finished screening when Juice was replaced by Garage TV on May 15, 2015\n*Jay and Flynny finished their show on 19 December 2014 after six years together and Flynny being on ZM for over a decade. They were replaced by Jase & PJ. \n*In December 2016, it was announced that The Night Show with Guy and Georgia would be replaced by The ZM Snapchart with Cam Mansel.\n*At the end of 2017, Jase & PJ departed the drive show. Until July 2018 the ZM Drive show consisted of edited best bits of their Breakfast show from Australia on [[KIIS 101.1]].\n*In July 2018, Bree & Clint replaced the pre-recorded best bits of Jase & PJ. The Jase & PJ highlight clip show has been moved to Saturday and Sunday mornings from 6am - 9am.\n\n==Programmes==\n===Fletch, Vaughan & Megan===\nThe breakfast show is presented by Carl \"Fletch\" Fletcher, Vaughan Smith and Megan Sellers with producers Anna Henvest and Georgia Burt.

ZM has traditionally run remix shows on Saturday nights since 1997 originally with the ZM Clubmix mixed by [[DJ Sample G]] (Grant Kearney) (1997 - 2003), General Lee on the Decks with DJ General Lee (2006 - 2008), Ministry of Sound Sessions with DJ General Lee (2008 - 2014), Ministry of Sound with Mikael Wills (2013-2017), Ministry of Sound with Timmy Trumpet (2015-2016) and Jupiter Project (2014-2017), Saturday Night Live with Anna Henvest (2017 - 2018). As of late 2018, Saturday Night Live has been replaced by a non-stop, ad and announcer free music mix.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\n===North Island===\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[ZM Whangarei]] - [[Whangarei]] {{Frequency|94.8|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Auckland]] - [[Auckland]] {{Frequency|91.0|MHz}}, {{Frequency|102.2|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Waikato]] - [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] {{Frequency|89.8|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Bay of Plenty]] - [[Tauranga, New Zealand|Tauranga]] - {{Frequency|89.4|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Bay of Plenty]] - [[Whakatane]] - {{Frequency|100.9|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Rotorua]] - [[Rotorua]] - {{Frequency|98.3|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Taupo]] - [[Taupo]] - {{Frequency|90.4|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Taupo]] - [[Taumarunui]] - {{Frequency|99.9|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Gisborne]] - [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] - {{Frequency|107.4|MHz}}, {{Frequency|107.7|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Hawke's Bay]] - [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] - {{Frequency|95.9|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Taranaki]] - [[Taranaki]] - {{Frequency|98.8|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Wanganui]] - [[Whanganui]] - {{Frequency|96.8|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Manawatu]] - [[Manawatu]] - {{Frequency|90.6|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Kapiti]] - [[Kapiti Coast]] - {{Frequency|91.1|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Wairarapa]] - [[Wairarapa]] - {{Frequency|94.3|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Wellington]] - [[Wellington]] - {{Frequency|90.9|MHz}}, {{Frequency|102.1|MHz}}\n{{colend}}\n\n===South Island===\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[ZM Nelson]] - [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] - {{Frequency|96.8|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Marlborough]] - Marlborough - {{Frequency|90.5|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Christchurch]] - [[Christchurch]] - {{Frequency|91.3|MHz}}, [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] - {{Frequency|90.1|MHz}}\n* [[ZM South Canterbury]] - Timaru - {{Frequency|96.3|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Dunedin]] - Dunedin - {{Frequency|88.6|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Queenstown]] - Queenstown - {{Frequency|88.8|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Queenstown]] - Wanaka - {{Frequency|100.2|MHz}}\n* [[ZM Invercargill]] - Invercargill - {{Frequency|95.6|MHz}}\n{{colend}}\n\n===ZMonline===\nIn early December 2010, ZM relaunched its online stream as a new station, rather than relaying an existing station as it had done previously. It became the 20th ZM station to connect to the network in the same way regional markets do. This gave ZMonline its own imaging & commercial options.\n\nLocal ads, weather and traffic are removed from the online station (as these are available on demand for every market inside the ZM iPhone and android apps). At the moment through every second commercial break the station plays a song.\n\n===ZM News Service===\nLike most radio stations in New Zealand ZM originally featured news on the hour every hour originally news was provided by the Radio New Zealand News Service, following the sale of the Radio New Zealand commercial service this became The Radio Network News Service. In 1997 ZM stations began reducing news breaks to only play on the breakfast show, this was at time when some radio stations began increasing the amount of music played in an hour and reducing talk. In 2000 ZM started their own news service called ''ZM Newsbeat''.\n\nZM News (formally called Newsbeat and Newsfeed) has news reports read out live followed by a local weather forecast prerecorded from the Auckland studio for each individual region. The bulletins are sourced from the NZME newsroom, and air hourly between 6 am-8 am weekdays with Anna Henvest, and weather hourly 4 pm-6 pm weekdays with Adam Cooper, with news and weather hourly 7 am-10am during the weekend and public holidays. An exclusive Wellington edition of ''ZM Newsbeat'' was aired during the Morning Crew's show up until early 2006, when it was dropped for the national edition. In April 2014 Newsbeat was renamed to Newsfeed coinciding with the re-launch of ZM, at the same time the Newsfeed service was introduced on [[The Hits (New Zealand)|The Hits]] with the former ZM news readers moved over to The Hits.\n\nTraffic reports are read out on air from The Radio Network Auckland studios for larger regions in New Zealand, for Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton, Tauranga and Dunedin. Other stations play advertisements during these times. Wellington originally ran their own local traffic reports until 2006.\n\nWeather is read out on weekdays following news bulletins. Individual weather reports are pre-recorded for each region and updated with each show. When the Morning Crew were based in Wellington, they read out the Wellington weather live during the breakfast show, while the pre-recorded reports by the newsreader air over the rest of the network.\n\n==ZM in the New Zealand Radio Awards==\nZM and ZM announcers have won the following awards at the [[New Zealand Radio Awards]]:\n\n===2005===\n*Special Commendation went to announcer Sarah Gandy for the ''ZM Sealed Section'' in the category ''Best Daily Or Weekly Series''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://radiostationworld.com/locations/New_Zealand/radio-awards_2005.asp |title=2005 Radio Award Finalist|publisher=RadioStationWorld -

On a high [[schist]] ridge that rises {{convert|200|ft|m}} above the [[Hudson River]] from [[Dyckman Street]] to the northern tip of the island, Inwood Hill Park's densely folded, glacially scoured topography contains the largest remaining [[old-growth forest]] on Manhattan Island. Unlike other Manhattan parks, Inwood Hill Park is largely natural and consists of mostly wooded, non-landscaped hills.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Site ===\n[[File:Shorakkopoch Rock.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Shorakkopoch Rock]]\n[[File:Inwoodhillpark.jpg|jpg|thumb|left|267px|Looking at the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]] from the park along the [[Harlem River]]]]\n[[File:WPA workers Inwood Hill Park (1938).jpg|thumb|left|267px|[[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] workers constructing a paved pathway in Inwood Hill Park (1938)]]\n\nInwood Hill Park has a human history that goes back to the [[Pre-Columbian era]]. Through the 17th century, Native Americans known as the [[Lenape]] inhabited the area. There is evidence of a main encampment along the eastern edge of the park. The Lenape relied on both the Hudson and Harlem Rivers as sources for food. Artifacts and the remains of old campfires were found in Inwood's rock shelters, suggesting their use for shelter and temporary living quarters. Legend has it that under a [[tulip tree]] in the park [[Peter Minuit]], Director General of New Netherland, purchased Manhattan from the a band of Native Americans in 1626 for the Dutch West India Company; the purchase price being a shipment of goods worth 60 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]]. The tree, the largest tulip on the island, survived for centuries until it was felled by a storm in 1933. Until the 1950s the base of the tree under which this transaction allegedly took place was still to be seen, surrounded by a large iron fence, but as it rotted it was finally removed and a boulder (Shorakkopoch Rock) and plaque replaced it.\n\n[[Fort Cockhill]], one of many forts built in New York by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, stood slightly north from the center of Inwood Hill Park. A small, five-sided earthen structure equipped with two cannons, it overlooked the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek at its confluence with the Hudson River. At the time, the area was known from Colonial to post\u2013Revolutionary War times as ''Cox's Hill'' or ''Tubby Hook Hill''.\n\nEven though the area which is now Inwood Hill Park was the site of one of the last farms in Manhattan \u2013 which lasted to at least c. 1890<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, p. 9</ref> \u2013 by the 19th century it was largely the location of country retreats for some of the wealthier families of the community and the rest of New York's social elite.<ref>{{cite news|author=Unknown|url=http://myinwood.net/inwood-in-1886/|title=Big Woods Right In Town (Inwood in 1886)|newspaper=[[New York World]]|date=December 26, 1886}}</ref> One such notable who had a summer estate in Inwood was [[Isidor Straus]], co-owner of the [[Macy's]] department store and a passenger on the ill-fated voyage of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. The Lords of the [[Lord & Taylor]] department store chain owned two mansions built within the park; both mansions were destroyed by fire in the latter part of the 19th century. Additionally, an [[orphanage]] was located high on a bluff in what is now Inwood Hill Park in the nineteenth century. The site today includes a small paved area and park benches; no trace of the building remains. At least three freshwater springs arise in the park, one of which was used for drinking water by the workers who constructed the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]].\n\n=== Use as park ===\n[[Andrew Haswell Green]], who was in charge of the [[Central Park Commissioner|Central Park Commission]], and responsible for laying out the streets on the [[Upper West Side]] and in [[Upper Manhattan]], first suggested that a park be created in Inwood in 1895.  His idea did not gain traction quickly, but the discovery of archeological finds in the area, the unique geology of the hill, historical associations (both true and merely rumored), the inherent beauty of the landscape and the views to be seen from it finally brought the city around,<ref name=concrete3637>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp. 36\u201337</ref> and between 1915 and the early 1940s, it purchased parcels of land that make up the park as it is today.\n\nThe park was officially opened on May 8, 1926.  Squatters who lived in the abandoned estates around the perimeter of the park were removed in the 1930s by [[Robert Moses]] and the [[Works Project Administration]].  The WPA also paved over some trails and illuminated them with lampposts, many of which are now in need of repair. Arson and dumping have damaged the park and its integrity, as have erosion-control measures which were not well conceived.<ref name=concrete3637 />\n\nOn September 15, 1995, the Inwood Hill Nature Center was dedicated and opened to the public. It is located near the park entrance on 218th Street and Indian Road. The center is located on Manhattan's only salt-water marsh, and has been designated as an interactive exhibit with ongoing monitoring of the natural area. It is also the focal point to watch the eagles that have been placed in the park to be freed when they are able to adjust to the environment.<ref>Renner, James (September 2003) [http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html \"Inwood Hill Park\"] ''Washington Heights & Inwood Onine'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902033654/http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html |date=September 2, 2010 }}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe park covers {{convert|196.4|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"NYC Parks\">{{cite web |title= Inwood Hill Park |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/inwoodhillpark |publisher= New York City Department of Parks and Recreation |accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> The [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Empire Connection]] run through it, and at its northern end the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]] and the rail-only [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]] link Manhattan to the Bronx.\n\nThe park's western boundary is the Hudson River, and the southern boundary is Dyckman Street.

These waterfowl can be studied further via educational programs held at the Nature Center at the north end of the property. [[Mallard]]s, [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[ring-billed gull]]s are year-round residents, using both the water and the nearby lawns and ballfields. Many wading birds and waterfowl pass through on the spring and fall migrations, and [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s often spend the summer.  Also in the [[salt marsh]] can be found fish, [[mollusks]] and [[crustaceans]] among the [[cordgrass]] and [[bulrush]]es which can tolerate both salt and fresh water.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\">Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35</ref>\n\nThe woods support a wide variety of birds, including common species such as [[blue jay]]s and [[Northern cardinal|cardinals]], as well as [[wild turkey]]s. [[bird of prey|Birds of prey]] that breed in the park include [[red-tailed hawk]]s and [[owl]]s. A five-year project that began in summer 2002 attempted to reintroduce the [[bald eagle]] to Manhattan using [[Hack (falconry)|hacking]] boxes in the park and eaglets brought in from the Midwest. In the first summer, three of the four introduced eaglets fledged successfully; three or four fledged each year of the program.<ref>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/urban_park_rangers/eaglecam/blog/index.html City of New York/Parks and Recreation Eagles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The nesting structure was removed in 2009.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThe park also sustains many types of trees and flowers which are no longer extant elsewhere on Manhattan Island, such as ''Dicentra cucullaria'', or \"Dutchman's breeches\". In 1918, Arthur Graves, then of the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and later a curator at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], found in the park a species of [[chestnut tree]] which was resistant to a blight which was then attacking the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of chestnut trees.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.32-26</ref>\n\nAnimals found in the park include Eastern and [[meadow vole]]s, red-bellied [[salamander]]s, [[southern flying squirrel]]s, [[opossum]]s, white-footed [[deer mice]], and [[cottontail rabbit]]s, as well as the expected [[eastern grey squirrel]]s and [[raccoon]]s. [[Foxes]] were also once residents, but the increasing number of [[coyote]]s spotted in [[Central Park]] and in the Bronx's [[Van Cortlandt Park]] may account for the foxes' apparent current absence.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThough the park does not support large wild mammals, the local wildlife does include raccoons and skunks as well as the usual city rodents. Both locals and people from outside the neighborhood fish from the riverbank at the north end of the park.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe park contains three children's [[playground]]s, baseball and soccer fields, and tennis and basketball courts.<ref name=\"Yarrow 1987\"/> The Inwood Hill Nature Center at the north end of the park is both a location for educational programs and the local headquarters of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation#Urban Park Rangers|Urban Park Rangers]]. Inwood Hill Park's ballfields are heavily used by local and other city Spanish-language leagues during the baseball season. This usage places extreme pressure on the park, which, as a result, has required more active management in recent years.\n\nThe lack of green space in the eastern part of Inwood and [[the Bronx]] nearby creates an enormous demand for picnicking with barbecues and table/chair setups, activity that is either illegal or tightly controlled in most city parks; however, Inwood Hill Park has managed this by permitting such setups on the manicured, maintained peninsula portion of the park.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Panorama\n | image      = File:Inwood Hill Park Panorama.jpg\n | caption    = <div align=center>Panorama of the park in fall</div>\n | height     = 180\n}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite concrete}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Inwood Hill Park}}\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/park_info_pages/park_info.php?propID=M042 NYC Parks: Inwood Hill Park]\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Protected areas of New York City}}\n\n[[Category:Inwood, Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Nature centers in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parks in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Urban public parks]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Works Progress Administration in New York City]]\n[[Category:Harlem River]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{short description|Public park in Manhattan, New York}}\n{{coord|40.872458|-73.925886|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Infobox park\n| name = Inwood Hill Park\n| photo = Native Caves.jpg\n| photo_width = 225px\n| photo_caption = Native American caves\n| type = [[Urban park]]\n| location = [[Inwood, Manhattan]], [[New York City]]\n| area = {{convert|196.4|acre|ha}}\n| created = 1926\n| operator = [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]\n}}\n\n'''Inwood Hill Park''' is a public [[park]] in the [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], operated by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

Through the 17th century, Native Americans known as the [[Lenape]] inhabited the area. There is evidence of a main encampment along the eastern edge of the park. The Lenape relied on both the Hudson and Harlem Rivers as sources for food. Artifacts and the remains of old campfires were found in Inwood's rock shelters, suggesting their use for shelter and temporary living quarters. Legend has it that under a [[tulip tree]] in the park [[Peter Minuit]], Director General of New Netherland, purchased Manhattan from the a band of Native Americans in 1626 for the Dutch West India Company; the purchase price being a shipment of goods worth 60 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]]. The tree, the largest tulip on the island, survived for centuries until it was felled by a storm in 1933. Until the 1950s the base of the tree under which this transaction allegedly took place was still to be seen, surrounded by a large iron fence, but as it rotted it was finally removed and a boulder (Shorakkopoch Rock) and plaque replaced it.\n\n[[Fort Cockhill]], one of many forts built in New York by the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, stood slightly north from the center of Inwood Hill Park. A small, five-sided earthen structure equipped with two cannons, it overlooked the mouth of Spuyten Duyvil Creek at its confluence with the Hudson River. At the time, the area was known from Colonial to post\u2013Revolutionary War times as ''Cox's Hill'' or ''Tubby Hook Hill''.\n\nEven though the area which is now Inwood Hill Park was the site of one of the last farms in Manhattan \u2013 which lasted to at least c. 1890<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, p. 9</ref> \u2013 by the 19th century it was largely the location of country retreats for some of the wealthier families of the community and the rest of New York's social elite.<ref>{{cite news|author=Unknown|url=http://myinwood.net/inwood-in-1886/|title=Big Woods Right In Town (Inwood in 1886)|newspaper=[[New York World]]|date=December 26, 1886}}</ref> One such notable who had a summer estate in Inwood was [[Isidor Straus]], co-owner of the [[Macy's]] department store and a passenger on the ill-fated voyage of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. The Lords of the [[Lord & Taylor]] department store chain owned two mansions built within the park; both mansions were destroyed by fire in the latter part of the 19th century. Additionally, an [[orphanage]] was located high on a bluff in what is now Inwood Hill Park in the nineteenth century. The site today includes a small paved area and park benches; no trace of the building remains. At least three freshwater springs arise in the park, one of which was used for drinking water by the workers who constructed the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]].\n\n=== Use as park ===\n[[Andrew Haswell Green]], who was in charge of the [[Central Park Commissioner|Central Park Commission]], and responsible for laying out the streets on the [[Upper West Side]] and in [[Upper Manhattan]], first suggested that a park be created in Inwood in 1895.  His idea did not gain traction quickly, but the discovery of archeological finds in the area, the unique geology of the hill, historical associations (both true and merely rumored), the inherent beauty of the landscape and the views to be seen from it finally brought the city around,<ref name=concrete3637>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp. 36\u201337</ref> and between 1915 and the early 1940s, it purchased parcels of land that make up the park as it is today.\n\nThe park was officially opened on May 8, 1926.  Squatters who lived in the abandoned estates around the perimeter of the park were removed in the 1930s by [[Robert Moses]] and the [[Works Project Administration]].  The WPA also paved over some trails and illuminated them with lampposts, many of which are now in need of repair. Arson and dumping have damaged the park and its integrity, as have erosion-control measures which were not well conceived.<ref name=concrete3637 />\n\nOn September 15, 1995, the Inwood Hill Nature Center was dedicated and opened to the public. It is located near the park entrance on 218th Street and Indian Road. The center is located on Manhattan's only salt-water marsh, and has been designated as an interactive exhibit with ongoing monitoring of the natural area. It is also the focal point to watch the eagles that have been placed in the park to be freed when they are able to adjust to the environment.<ref>Renner, James (September 2003) [http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html \"Inwood Hill Park\"] ''Washington Heights & Inwood Onine'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902033654/http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/inwood_hill_park_96.html |date=September 2, 2010 }}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Geography==\nThe park covers {{convert|196.4|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"NYC Parks\">{{cite web |title= Inwood Hill Park |url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/inwoodhillpark |publisher= New York City Department of Parks and Recreation |accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> The [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] and [[Amtrak]]'s [[Empire Connection]] run through it, and at its northern end the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]] and the rail-only [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]] link Manhattan to the Bronx.\n\nThe park's western boundary is the Hudson River, and the southern boundary is Dyckman Street.

These waterfowl can be studied further via educational programs held at the Nature Center at the north end of the property. [[Mallard]]s, [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[ring-billed gull]]s are year-round residents, using both the water and the nearby lawns and ballfields. Many wading birds and waterfowl pass through on the spring and fall migrations, and [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s often spend the summer.  Also in the [[salt marsh]] can be found fish, [[mollusks]] and [[crustaceans]] among the [[cordgrass]] and [[bulrush]]es which can tolerate both salt and fresh water.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\">Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35</ref>\n\nThe woods support a wide variety of birds, including common species such as [[blue jay]]s and [[Northern cardinal|cardinals]], as well as [[wild turkey]]s. [[bird of prey|Birds of prey]] that breed in the park include [[red-tailed hawk]]s and [[owl]]s. A five-year project that began in summer 2002 attempted to reintroduce the [[bald eagle]] to Manhattan using [[Hack (falconry)|hacking]] boxes in the park and eaglets brought in from the Midwest. In the first summer, three of the four introduced eaglets fledged successfully; three or four fledged each year of the program.<ref>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_about/parks_divisions/urban_park_rangers/eaglecam/blog/index.html City of New York/Parks and Recreation Eagles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The nesting structure was removed in 2009.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThe park also sustains many types of trees and flowers which are no longer extant elsewhere on Manhattan Island, such as ''Dicentra cucullaria'', or \"Dutchman's breeches\". In 1918, Arthur Graves, then of the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and later a curator at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], found in the park a species of [[chestnut tree]] which was resistant to a blight which was then attacking the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of chestnut trees.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.32-26</ref>\n\nAnimals found in the park include Eastern and [[meadow vole]]s, red-bellied [[salamander]]s, [[southern flying squirrel]]s, [[opossum]]s, white-footed [[deer mice]], and [[cottontail rabbit]]s, as well as the expected [[eastern grey squirrel]]s and [[raccoon]]s. [[Foxes]] were also once residents, but the increasing number of [[coyote]]s spotted in [[Central Park]] and in the Bronx's [[Van Cortlandt Park]] may account for the foxes' apparent current absence.<ref name=\"Eldredge & Horenstein, pp.34-35\"/>\n\nThough the park does not support large wild mammals, the local wildlife does include raccoons and skunks as well as the usual city rodents. Both locals and people from outside the neighborhood fish from the riverbank at the north end of the park.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe park contains three children's [[playground]]s, baseball and soccer fields, and tennis and basketball courts.<ref name=\"Yarrow 1987\"/> The Inwood Hill Nature Center at the north end of the park is both a location for educational programs and the local headquarters of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation#Urban Park Rangers|Urban Park Rangers]]. Inwood Hill Park's ballfields are heavily used by local and other city Spanish-language leagues during the baseball season. This usage places extreme pressure on the park, which, as a result, has required more active management in recent years.\n\nThe lack of green space in the eastern part of Inwood and [[the Bronx]] nearby creates an enormous demand for picnicking with barbecues and table/chair setups, activity that is either illegal or tightly controlled in most city parks; however, Inwood Hill Park has managed this by permitting such setups on the manicured, maintained peninsula portion of the park.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Panorama\n | image      = File:Inwood Hill Park Panorama.jpg\n | caption    = <div align=center>Panorama of the park in fall</div>\n | height     = 180\n}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite concrete}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Inwood Hill Park}}\n* [http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/park_info_pages/park_info.php?propID=M042 NYC Parks: Inwood Hill Park]\n\n<!--spacing-->\n\n{{Protected areas of New York City}}\n\n[[Category:Inwood, Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Nature centers in New York City]]\n[[Category:Parks in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Urban public parks]]\n[[Category:1926 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Works Progress Administration in New York City]]\n[[Category:Harlem River]]\n", "name_user": "HaileJones", "label": "safe", "comment": "unnecessary quotes removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwood_Hill_Park"}

Yukos claims its actions were legal at the time and that the company used the same tax optimisation schemes as other Russian oil companies, such as Lukoil, TNK-BP and Sibneft. However, Yukos was the only one to be charged with tax evasion and penalised by the authorities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Russian officials draw up a memorandum to the European Court|url=http://www.old.khodorkovsky.info/authority/134825.html|date=January 30, 2007|work=Kommersant|accessdate=2010-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215842/http://www.old.khodorkovsky.info/authority/134825.html|archive-date=July 21, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nYukos subsidiaries declared the oil they produced to be \"oil-containing liquids\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Manager of Yukos' \"daughter\" admitted tax evasion|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2005/09/12/samara|date=September 12, 2005|language=Russian|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> to avoid paying full taxes.

The reason given was to prevent a group of shareholders led by Khodorkovsky from selling a large stake of the company to the US oil firm [[Exxon]]. A Yukos shareholders' meeting scheduled for December 20, 2004 was to discuss a \"crisis plan.\" A Russian company must hold such a meeting before it can apply for bankruptcy in Russia. The Russian Government sold Yukos's main production unit, known as ''Yuganskneftegas'', at auction on December 19, 2004 to recover some of US$28&nbsp;billion in alleged tax debts, following the loss of an appeal by the firm. [[Bank Menatep|Menatep]], the company representing Khodorkovsky, promised to challenge the sale's legality in a number of countries, and to sue the buyer and any company helping to fund the deal.

When the auctioneer asked Gazpromneft to offer its price, a representative of the company asked to make a telephone call and left the room. A few minutes earlier, the auctioneer had told participants that using a mobile phone or leaving the room was against the rules. When a Gazpromneft representative returned to the room, Baikal made a bid of US$9.3&nbsp;billion. Gazpromneft never placed a bid or spoke out. Shortly after the Yuganskneftegaz auction, Rosneft, Russian state-owned oil company, acquired 100% of shares in Baikalfinansgrup.

In April 1934, Ginzburg was officially confirmed as a [[docent]] (approximately equivalent to an associate professor in western universities), specializing in the history of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party]]. Shortly thereafter,  on May 25, she was named head of the newly created department of the history of Leninism. However, by the fall of 1935, she was forced to quit the university.<ref>''Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,'' p. 19.</ref>\n\nShe first married a doctor Dmitriy Fedorov, by whom she had a son, Alexei Fedorov, born in 1926. He died in 1941 during the [[siege of Leningrad]]. Around 1930, she married Pavel Aksyonov, the mayor (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430) of Kazan and a member of the Central Executive Committee (\u0426\u0418\u041a) of the USSR. Her son by this marriage, [[Vasily Aksyonov]], born in 1932, became a well-known writer. After becoming a Communist Party member, Ginzburg continued her successful career as educator, journalist and administrator.\n\n==Persecution==\nFollowing the assassination of [[Sergei Mironovich Kirov]] on December 1, 1934, Ginzburg, like many communists (see the [[Great Purge]]), was accused of participating in a \"counter-revolutionary Trotskyist group,\" this one led by Professor Nikolay Naumovich Elvov and concentrated in the editorial board of the newspaper ''Krasnaya Tatariia'' (Red Tataria) where she was employed. After a long fight to keep her party card, she was expelled from the party, officially excluded on February 8, 1937. Then, on February 15, 1937, she was arrested, accused of engaging in counter-revolutionary activity in El'vov's group and concealing this activity. Because she was a party member throughout this alleged activity, she was also accused of \"playing a double game.\"<ref>''Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,'' p. 21.</ref> From the day of her arrest, and unlike most of those around her, she forcefully denied the NKVD's accusations and never accepted any role in the supposed \"counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization.\"As recorded in her initial interrogation, when asked whether she recognized her guilt, she responded \"I do not acknowledge it. I have not engaged in any Trotskyist struggle with the party. I have not been a member of a counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization.\" '<ref>'Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,'' doc. 8, p. 27.</ref>\n\nHer parents were also arrested but released two months later. Her husband was arrested in July, sentenced to 15 years of \"[[forced labor|corrective labor]],\" and his property confiscated under Articles 58-7 and 11 of the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|RSFSR Penal Code]].\n\n===Trial===\nOn August 1, 1937, although Ginzburg still did not recognize her supposed guilt (despite the NKVD's repeated, ruthless interrogations), a closed meeting of the Military College of the Supreme Court of the USSR (in Moscow) sentenced her to 10 years imprisonment with deprivation of political rights for five years and confiscation of all her personal property. The judgement was declared to be final with no possibility of appeal. Ginzburg later wrote, in a letter to the chairman of the Presidium of the USSR's Supreme Soviet, that her entire \"trial\" took seven minutes, including the questioning and reading of the judgement: \"My judges were in such a hurry that they did not answer any of my questions and declarations.\"<ref>''Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,''  p. 6.</ref> In one of the most revealing chapters of her autobiography, Ginzburg expressed great ''relief'' upon hearing the verdict, because she had feared up to that very moment that she would be condemned to death:\n\n<blockquote>To live! Without property, but what was that to me? Let them confiscate it \u2013 they were brigands anyway, confiscating was their business. They wouldn't get much good out of mine, a few books and clothes \u2013 why, we didn't even have a radio. My husband was a loyal Communist of the old stamp, not the kind who had to have a Buick or a Mercedes... Ten years!... Do you [the judges], with your codfish faces, really think you can go on robbing and murdering for another ten years, that there aren't people in the Party who will stop you sooner or later? I knew there were \u2013 and in order to see that day, I must live. In prison, if needs be, but I must at all costs live!... I looked at the guards, whose hands were still clasped behind my back. Every nerve in my body was quivering with the joy of being alive. What nice faces the guards had! Peasant boys from [[Ryazan]] or [[Kursk]], most likely. They couldn't help being warders \u2013 no doubt they were conscripts. And they had joined hands to save me from falling. But they needn't have \u2013 I wasn't going to fall. I shook back my hair curled so carefully before facing the court, so as not to disgrace the memory of [[Charlotte Corday]]. Then I gave the guards a friendly smile. They looked at me in astonishment.<ref>Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg, ''Journey into the Whirlwind'', trans. Paul Stevenson and Max Hayward (New York: Harcourt, Inc., 1967), p. 174.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Imprisonment and exile===\nYevgenia experienced at first hand the infamous [[Lefortovo prison|Lefortovo]] and [[Butyrka prison|Butyrka]] prisons in Moscow, and the [[Yaroslavl]] \"Korovniki\". She crossed the USSR on a prison train to [[Vladivostok]] and was put in the cargo hold of the steamer ''Jurma'' (\u0414\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430) whose destination was [[Magadan]]. There she worked at a camp hospital, but was soon sent to the harsh camps of the [[Kolyma]] valley, where she was assigned to so-called \"common jobs\" and quickly became an emaciated ''dokhodyaga'' (\"goner\"). A [[Crimean German]] doctor, Anton Walter, probably saved her life by recommending her for a nursing position; they eventually married. Anton had been deported because of his German heritage.\n\nIn February 1949, Ginzburg was released from the [[Gulag]] system, but was ordered to remain in the town of [[Magadan]] for five further years. She found a position at a kindergarten and began to write her memoirs in secret. However, in October 1949, she was arrested again and exiled to the [[Krasnoyarsk]] region, but (at her request) her destination was changed to Kolyma at the last minute. No reason was ever given for this second arrest and exile.<ref>''Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,'' pp. 13-14.</ref>\n\nAfter conversion of her status from detained to exiled, she could marry a doctor of the same fate, Anton Walter. The couple adopted an orphan detainee girl, Antonina, later an actress (Antonina Pavlovna Aksyonova, sibling sister of Vasily Aksyonov).\n\n==Rehabilitation and later life==\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953 and following Ginzburg's repeated, vigorous appeals to various authorities to have her case reconsidered, she was released from the exile (on 25 June 1955) and allowed to return to Moscow. She was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in 1955.\n\nShe returned to [[Moscow]], worked as a reporter and continued her work on her [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], her memoir ''[[Journey into the Whirlwind]]'' (English title). She finished the book in 1967 but was unable to publish it in the USSR. The manuscript was then smuggled abroad and published in 1967 by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori]] in [[Milan]] and Possev in [[Frankfurt am Main]];<ref>Christine Rydel, ''Dictionary of Literary Biography: Russian Prose Writers Since WWII'' (Thomson Gale, 2005: {{ISBN|0-7876-6839-7}}), p. 89.</ref> it has since been translated into many languages. Eventually, her memoir was divided into two parts, whose Russian titles are \"Krutoi marshrut I\" and \"Krutoi marshrut II\" -- \"Harsh Route\" or \"Steep Route.\" She died in Moscow, aged 72.\n\n== Film ==\nA Ginzburg [[biopic]], titled, ''[[Within the Whirlwind]]'' was filmed by director [[Marleen Gorris]] in 2008. The film features actress [[Emily Watson]] as Yevgenia Ginzburg, with [[Pam Ferris]] and [[Ben Miller]] in other roles.

I have not been a member of a counter-revolutionary Trotskyist organization.\" '<ref>'Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,'' doc. 8, p. 27.</ref>\n\nHer parents were also arrested but released two months later. Her husband was arrested in July, sentenced to 15 years of \"[[forced labor|corrective labor]],\" and his property confiscated under Articles 58-7 and 11 of the [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|RSFSR Penal Code]].\n\n===Trial===\nOn August 1, 1937, although Ginzburg still did not recognize her supposed guilt (despite the NKVD's repeated, ruthless interrogations), a closed meeting of the Military College of the Supreme Court of the USSR (in Moscow) sentenced her to 10 years imprisonment with deprivation of political rights for five years and confiscation of all her personal property. The judgement was declared to be final with no possibility of appeal. Ginzburg later wrote, in a letter to the chairman of the Presidium of the USSR's Supreme Soviet, that her entire \"trial\" took seven minutes, including the questioning and reading of the judgement: \"My judges were in such a hurry that they did not answer any of my questions and declarations.\"<ref>''Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,''  p. 6.</ref> In one of the most revealing chapters of her autobiography, Ginzburg expressed great ''relief'' upon hearing the verdict, because she had feared up to that very moment that she would be condemned to death:\n\n<blockquote>To live! Without property, but what was that to me? Let them confiscate it \u2013 they were brigands anyway, confiscating was their business. They wouldn't get much good out of mine, a few books and clothes \u2013 why, we didn't even have a radio. My husband was a loyal Communist of the old stamp, not the kind who had to have a Buick or a Mercedes... Ten years!... Do you [the judges], with your codfish faces, really think you can go on robbing and murdering for another ten years, that there aren't people in the Party who will stop you sooner or later? I knew there were \u2013 and in order to see that day, I must live. In prison, if needs be, but I must at all costs live!... I looked at the guards, whose hands were still clasped behind my back. Every nerve in my body was quivering with the joy of being alive. What nice faces the guards had! Peasant boys from [[Ryazan]] or [[Kursk]], most likely. They couldn't help being warders \u2013 no doubt they were conscripts. And they had joined hands to save me from falling. But they needn't have \u2013 I wasn't going to fall. I shook back my hair curled so carefully before facing the court, so as not to disgrace the memory of [[Charlotte Corday]]. Then I gave the guards a friendly smile. They looked at me in astonishment.<ref>Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg, ''Journey into the Whirlwind'', trans. Paul Stevenson and Max Hayward (New York: Harcourt, Inc., 1967), p. 174.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Imprisonment and exile===\nYevgenia experienced at first hand the infamous [[Lefortovo prison|Lefortovo]] and [[Butyrka prison|Butyrka]] prisons in Moscow, and the [[Yaroslavl]] \"Korovniki\". She crossed the USSR on a prison train to [[Vladivostok]] and was put in the cargo hold of the steamer ''Jurma'' (\u0414\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430) whose destination was [[Magadan]]. There she worked at a camp hospital, but was soon sent to the harsh camps of the [[Kolyma]] valley, where she was assigned to so-called \"common jobs\" and quickly became an emaciated ''dokhodyaga'' (\"goner\"). A [[Crimean German]] doctor, Anton Walter, probably saved her life by recommending her for a nursing position; they eventually married. Anton had been deported because of his German heritage.\n\nIn February 1949, Ginzburg was released from the [[Gulag]] system, but was ordered to remain in the town of [[Magadan]] for five further years. She found a position at a kindergarten and began to write her memoirs in secret. However, in October 1949, she was arrested again and exiled to the [[Krasnoyarsk]] region, but (at her request) her destination was changed to Kolyma at the last minute. No reason was ever given for this second arrest and exile.<ref>''Dva sledstvennykh dela Evgenii Ginzburg,'' pp. 13-14.</ref>\n\nAfter conversion of her status from detained to exiled, she could marry a doctor of the same fate, Anton Walter. The couple adopted an orphan detainee girl, Antonina, later an actress (Antonina Pavlovna Aksyonova, sibling sister of Vasily Aksyonov).\n\n==Rehabilitation and later life==\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953 and following Ginzburg's repeated, vigorous appeals to various authorities to have her case reconsidered, she was released from the exile (on 25 June 1955) and allowed to return to Moscow. She was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in 1955.\n\nShe returned to [[Moscow]], worked as a reporter and continued her work on her [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], her memoir ''[[Journey into the Whirlwind]]'' (English title). She finished the book in 1967 but was unable to publish it in the USSR. The manuscript was then smuggled abroad and published in 1967 by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Mondadori]] in [[Milan]] and Possev in [[Frankfurt am Main]];<ref>Christine Rydel, ''Dictionary of Literary Biography: Russian Prose Writers Since WWII'' (Thomson Gale, 2005: {{ISBN|0-7876-6839-7}}), p. 89.</ref> it has since been translated into many languages. Eventually, her memoir was divided into two parts, whose Russian titles are \"Krutoi marshrut I\" and \"Krutoi marshrut II\" -- \"Harsh Route\" or \"Steep Route.\" She died in Moscow, aged 72.\n\n== Film ==\nA Ginzburg [[biopic]], titled, ''[[Within the Whirlwind]]'' was filmed by director [[Marleen Gorris]] in 2008. The film features actress [[Emily Watson]] as Yevgenia Ginzburg, with [[Pam Ferris]] and [[Ben Miller]] in other roles.

The two-story, eight room, brick home was constructed circa 1838\u201339 in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The Coffin home became known as the \"Grand Central Station\" of the [[Underground Railroad]] because of its location where three of the escape routes to the North converged and the number of fugitive slaves who passed through it.\n\nIts original owners, Catharine and [[Levi Coffin]], were [[Quakers|Quaker]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who provided fugitive slaves with supplies and a safe place to stay. During the twenty years (1826 to 1847) that The Coffins lived in [[Indiana]] it is believed that they helped as many as 2,000 slaves escape to freedom in the [[Northern United States]] and in [[Canada]]. (The Coffins continued their role as local leaders in the Underground Railroad after their move to [[Ohio]] in 1847 and provided aid to approximately 1,300 more slaves to assist in their escape to the North.) In 1966 the Coffin's Indiana home became the first property in the state to be added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Levi Coffin House Association operates the property under an agreement with the [[Indiana Department of Natural Resources]], the historic home's present-day owner.

Stairs lead down to a kitchen and spring room in the basement. A spring-fed well in the basement provided the home with access to fresh water. The second floor contains three bedrooms.<ref name=\"nrhpinv3\"/>\n\nThe Coffin home's interior had several modifications that could have been used as hiding places for runaway slaves in case the house was searched. Most of the rooms have at least two exits. A secret door installed in the maids' quarters in the rear addition on the second floor provided access for as many as fourteen fugitive slaves to hide in a narrow crawlspace between the walls.

The two-story, eight room, brick home was constructed circa 1838\u201339 in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The Coffin home became known as the \"Grand Central Station\" of the [[Underground Railroad]] because of its location where three of the escape routes to the North converged and the number of fugitive slaves who passed through it.\n\nIts original owners, Catharine and [[Levi Coffin]], were [[Quakers|Quaker]] [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who provided fugitive slaves with supplies and a safe place to stay. During the twenty years (1826 to 1847) that The Coffins lived in [[Indiana]] it is believed that they helped as many as 2,000 slaves escape to freedom in the [[Northern United States]] and in [[Canada]]. (The Coffins continued their role as local leaders in the Underground Railroad after their move to [[Ohio]] in 1847 and provided aid to approximately 1,300 more slaves to assist in their escape to the North.) In 1966 the Coffin's Indiana home became the first property in the state to be added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Levi Coffin House Association operates the property under an agreement with the [[Indiana Department of Natural Resources]], the historic home's present-day owner.

Most Antarctic penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. For an example see the photo of nesting [[emperor penguin]]. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of four to six or more individuals then disperse along track to individual nests sites out of sight of each other.  The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest. Nest sites are selected in August and normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39\u201351 days) are shared by both parents who may spend several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner.\n\nAfter the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually fledge in mid-February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6&nbsp;kg.\n\nFirst breeding occurs at three to four years of age and long-term partnerships are formed.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the rarest penguin species in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yellow-eyedpenguin.org.nz/penguins/population-recent-trends/|title=Population and recent trends|website=Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> It is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as being endangered.

Most Antarctic penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. For an example see the photo of nesting [[emperor penguin]]. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of four to six or more individuals then disperse along track to individual nests sites out of sight of each other.  The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest. Nest sites are selected in August and normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39\u201351 days) are shared by both parents who may spend several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner.\n\nAfter the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually fledge in mid-February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6&nbsp;kg.\n\nFirst breeding occurs at three to four years of age and long-term partnerships are formed.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the rarest penguin species in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yellow-eyedpenguin.org.nz/penguins/population-recent-trends/|title=Population and recent trends|website=Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref> It is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as being endangered.
