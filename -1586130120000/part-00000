In 1980, shortly after the start of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], they sought [[political asylum]] in the United States and made their residence in [[San Jose, California]]. Hosseini, then aged 15, did not speak English when he first arrived in the United States. He describes the experience as \"a culture shock\" and \"very alienating\".<ref name=\"Hoby\" />\n\nDespite their distance from the country's turmoil, the family was aware of the situations faced by a number of their friends and relatives. Hosseini explained:\n\n{{quote|We had a lot of family and friends in Kabul. And the communist coup, as opposed to the coup that happened in '73, was actually very violent. A lot of people rounded up and executed, a lot of people were imprisoned. Virtually anybody that was affiliated or associated with the previous regime or the royal family was persecuted, imprisoned, killed, rounded up, or disappeared. And so we would hear news of friends and acquaintances and occasionally family members to whom that had happened, that were either in prison or worse, had just disappeared and nobody knew where they were, and some of them never turned up. My wife's uncle was a very famous singer and composer in Kabul who had been quite vocal about his dislike for the communists and so on and he disappeared. And to this day, we have no idea what happened to him. So that sort of thing, we began to hear news over in Europe of mass executions and really just horror stories. So it was surreal, and it also really kind of hit home in a very real way.<ref name=\"AAA\" />}}\n\n===Education===\nHosseini graduated from [[Independence High School (San Jose, California)|Independence High School]] in San Jose in 1984 and enrolled at [[Santa Clara University]], where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[biology]] in 1988. The following year, he entered the [[University of California San Diego]] [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], where he earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1993. He completed his [[residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[internal medicine]] at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 1997.

The novel is set in Afghanistan, from the fall of the monarchy until the collapse of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban regime]], and in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], specifically in Fremont, California. The novel was the number one best seller for 2005 in the United States, according to [[Nielsen BookScan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=80320#big%20movie|date=2006-01-07|accessdate=2007-02-14|title=Harry Potter tops US best-seller list for 2005|work=ninemsn.com.au|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302070341/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=80320#big%20movie|archive-date=2007-03-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''The Kite Runner'' was also produced as an audiobook read by the author. ''The Kite Runner'' has been adapted into a [[The Kite Runner (film)|film of the same name]] released in December 2007. Hosseini made a cameo appearance towards the end of the movie as a bystander when Amir buys a kite which he later flies with Sohrab.\n\nHosseini's second novel, ''[[A Thousand Splendid Suns]]'', was published in 2007, and is also set in Afghanistan. The story addresses many of the same issues as Hosseini's first, but takes a more feminine perspective. It follows the story of two women, Mariam and Laila, whose lives become entwined. The story is set during Afghanistan's tumultuous thirty-year transition from Soviet occupation to Taliban control and post-Taliban rebuilding. The novel was released by [[Riverhead Books]] on May 22, 2007, at the same time as the Simon & Schuster audiobook.

Hosseini, then aged 15, did not speak English when he first arrived in the United States. He describes the experience as \"a culture shock\" and \"very alienating\".<ref name=\"Hoby\" />\n\nDespite their distance from the country's turmoil, the family was aware of the situations faced by a number of their friends and relatives. Hosseini explained:\n\n{{quote|We had a lot of family and friends in Kabul. And the communist coup, as opposed to the coup that happened in '73, was actually very violent. A lot of people rounded up and executed, a lot of people were imprisoned. Virtually anybody that was affiliated or associated with the previous regime or the royal family was persecuted, imprisoned, killed, rounded up, or disappeared. And so we would hear news of friends and acquaintances and occasionally family members to whom that had happened, that were either in prison or worse, had just disappeared and nobody knew where they were, and some of them never turned up. My wife's uncle was a very famous singer and composer in Kabul who had been quite vocal about his dislike for the communists and so on and he disappeared. And to this day, we have no idea what happened to him. So that sort of thing, we began to hear news over in Europe of mass executions and really just horror stories.

The following year, he entered the [[University of California San Diego]] [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], where he earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1993.

The novel is set in Afghanistan, from the fall of the monarchy until the collapse of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban regime]], and in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], specifically in Fremont, California.

''The Kite Runner'' has been adapted into a [[The Kite Runner (film)|film of the same name]] released in December 2007. Hosseini made a cameo appearance towards the end of the movie as a bystander when Amir buys a kite which he later flies with Sohrab.\n\nHosseini's second novel, ''[[A Thousand Splendid Suns]]'', was published in 2007, and is also set in Afghanistan. The story addresses many of the same issues as Hosseini's first, but takes a more feminine perspective. It follows the story of two women, Mariam and Laila, whose lives become entwined. The story is set during Afghanistan's tumultuous thirty-year transition from Soviet occupation to Taliban control and post-Taliban rebuilding. The novel was released by [[Riverhead Books]] on May 22, 2007, at the same time as the Simon & Schuster audiobook.

The rank of General of the Armies is equivalent to the [[Admiral of the Navy]] and is senior to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]], [[General of the Air Force]], and [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:WashingtonInsig1782.jpg|thumb|right|George Washington's rank insignia as \"General and Commander-in-Chief\"]]\n\nAppointment to the rank or grade of General of the Armies of the United States has a history spanning over two centuries. In the course of its existence the authority and seniority of the rank, and perceptions by both the American public and the military establishment, have varied.  The first mention of the rank \"General of the Armies\" was in an Act of the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1799.  Congress provided:\n\n<blockquote>That a Commander of the United States shall be appointed and [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] by the style of General of the Armies of the United States and the present office and title of Lieutenant General shall thereafter be abolished.</blockquote>\n\nThe rank of General of the Armies was intended for bestowal upon George Washington, who held the rank of \"[[Continental Army#Rank insignia|General and Commander-in-Chief]]\" which was a grade senior to all American major generals and brigadier generals from the [[American Revolutionary War]].  However, only a few months after the Congressional proposal, Washington died on December 14, 1799.  The United States Army at that time had also drastically reduced in size and there was no practical need for a superior General rank, thus the proposal for General of the Armies was soon forgotten.\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:US Army General insignia (1866).svg|thumb|right|Civil War era insignia for \"General of the Army of the United States\"]]\n\nIn 1865, after the close of the [[American Civil War]], Congress again revisited the idea of a superior General rank.  The result was the creation of a special rank called \"General of the Army of the United States\", which was held by [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref name=\"Military Laws 1915\">{{cite book|title=The military laws of the United States, 1915, Volume 1, Issue 915 (also The military laws of the United States, 1915, Volume 1, Issue 915)|last=Office of the Judge Advocate General, United States Army|authorlink= |year=1915 |publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC}}</ref> This early version of General of the Army was in fact a [[four-star rank|four-star]] general officer rank although, unlike in modern times, Congress intended for only one Army officer to hold the position, thus granting the rank the same authority as the initial concept of General of the Armies. [[William T. Sherman]]<ref name=\"Military Laws 1915\"/> and [[Philip Sheridan]]<ref name=\"Military Laws 1915\"/> would also hold the position.  During Sherman's tenure, the insignia was changed to that of a [[major general]] superimposed upon a golden national eagle.\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:General of Armies insignia.svg|thumb|right|John Pershing's gold star insignia]]\n\nThe rank of General of the Army of the United States ceased to exist upon the death of Sheridan in 1888. The next proposal to create a superior general rank would occur thirty-one years later during the [[First World War]]. In the interim, the highest possible general officer rank of the United States Army was that of two-star major general.  Within the [[United States Navy]], three- and four-star ranks continued into the 20th century, leading to the creation of the [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]] rank in 1899. [[George Dewey]] was appointed this rank which, at the time of its creation, was considered a four-star admiral with an added honorary title.  A comparison between Admiral of the Navy and General of the Armies was first made in 1944, although the rank of Admiral of the Navy was never declared equal in seniority.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[United States Congress]] authorized the appointment of three-star lieutenant generals and four-star generals to be granted temporarily for service in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]]. [[Tasker H. Bliss]] and [[John J. Pershing]] were promoted to general in October 1917, and [[Peyton C. March]] was promoted to that rank in May 1918. [[Hunter Liggett]] and [[Robert Lee Bullard]] were both promoted to lieutenant general on October 16, 1918.  In 1919, by Congressional directive, the rank of General of the Armies was formally established and John J. Pershing became the first person to hold the rank.\n\nAfter the close of the First World War, the highest active grade in the U.S. Army again became major general, with all lieutenant generals and generals (except for Pershing) reverted to this permanent rank of major general.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1920/06/30/archives/only-major-generals-now-march-liggett-and-bullard-lose-war-rank4.html Only Major Generals Now; March, Liggett and Bullard Lose War Rank] The New York Times, June 30, 1920</ref> Pershing then retired from the United States Army on September 13, 1924, and retained his rank on the U.S. Army retirement rolls until his death in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/FAQ-5star.htm|title=How many U.S. Army five-star generals have there been and who were they?|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}</ref> Four-star generals were reauthorized in 1929, starting with [[Charles Pelot Summerall]]. Pershing at this time was no longer on active duty, but his rank was regarded as senior to a full general outside the regular promotion tier.\n\n===Second World War===\nOn December 14, 1944, the United States Army established a five-star general position and named this new rank \"General of the Army\", which was a title that had not been used since the 1880s after the Civil War. Unlike the Civil War version, this new rank was clearly a five-star position, whereas the old version was considered a four-star rank; the five-star rank was also intended to be held by more than one person rather than a single supreme rank for the head of the U.S. Army.\n\n[[File:6 Star.svg|thumb|Insignia for six star general]]\n\n===General of the Armies===\n\nPershing was still living during World War II, although he was over eighty years old when the United States entered the war. Nevertheless, the question was immediately raised by both the media and the public as to whether Pershing's rank \"fit in\" with the new five-star position. It was decided that Pershing would outrank all five-star generals by order of seniority, meaning that even if he did not have a higher rank, he was considered senior by virtue of an earlier date of promotion into that rank. There was still rampant speculation, however, that Pershing was a six-star general, and the media put the matter directly to the War Department for a clear and concise answer.\n\nIn response to a direct question as to whether Pershing held six-star rank, the then [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Henry L. Stimson]] stated:\n\n<blockquote>It appears the intent of the Army was to make the General of the Armies senior in grade to the General of the Army. I have advised Congress that the War Department concurs in such proposed action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/armyorank/blgoa.htm |accessdate=17 August 2014 |title=General of the Armies of the United States and General of the Army of the United States |work=US Military |publisher=About.com |date=2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Together we served\">{{cite web |url=https://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=7151 |accessdate=17 August 2014 |title=Pershing, John, GEN |work=Together we Served |publisher= |date=2011 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe situation with Pershing was seemingly solved, but the matter of a six-star general in the United States military would reappear in only a few months during the summer of 1945 at which time [[Douglas MacArthur]] was proposed for promotion to General of the Armies.  Efforts to promote MacArthur, although never successful, would continue for the next twenty years and lapse only with his death in 1964.\n\n===Developments since the 1970s===\n[[File:U.S. Army O-12 shoulderboard, rotated (1981\u20132015).png|thumb|Proposed insignia for General of the Armies as published in 1981 following the death of Omar Bradley]]\n\nThe rank of General of the Armies was revisited with a posthumous promotion of George Washington in 1976.<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW----> In 1981, upon the death of [[Omar Bradley]], brief consideration was given for another posthumous promotion; however, no action was taken beyond designing a potential \"modern day\" insignia for General of the Armies.\n\nThe most recent reference to the rank of General of the Armies occurred in 2008 when the Army authorized the [[Army Service Uniform]] as the new standard uniform for United States soldiers.  As part of the first presentations of the uniform to Army leadership, the [[Institute of Heraldry]] created an insignia chart with officer ranks ranging from [[Second lieutenant]] to General of the Armies of the United States.<ref>\"IOH chart shows five- and six-star generals\", Army Times (2008)</ref>\n\n==Officers appointed as General of the Armies==\n\n===John J.

As of 1782, when Washington was listed as a lieutenant general on the rolls of the [[United States Army]], his rank was informally called \"three-star general\".  The United States at this point had no four-star general rank and would not until 1866.  At that time, the European rank of [[captain general]] was shortened to simply \"general\"; there would also be no lieutenant generals in the American army until Winfield Scott was \"[[Brevet (military)|brevetted]]\" to the rank of lieutenant general in 1855.\n\n[[File:Orders 31-3.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The [[s:File:Orders 31-3.jpg|formal promotion order]] signed by [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Clifford Alexander, Jr.]]]]\nOn March 13, 1978, Washington was posthumously promoted to the full grade of ''General of the Armies of the United States'', with effective date from July 4, 1976.<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW---->\n\nThe [[s:File:Orders 31-3.jpg|formal promotion order]] signed by [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Clifford Alexander, Jr.]], simply formalized the promotion.  It did not mention six-star status, nor did it include, as the legislation did, the phrasing \"such grade to have rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\".  The legislation implicitly clarified the relationship of Washington's rank to Pershing's.  Public Law 94-479, which codified the rank of General of the Armies of the United States, did not create a separate rank from Pershing's but rather simply clarified that, while Washington and Pershing held the same rank, Washington was to be considered senior.\n\n====Promotion legislation====\n{{quote|Whereas Lieutenant General George Washington of Virginia commanded our armies throughout and to the successful termination of our Revolutionary War;\nWhereas Lieutenant General George Washington presided over the convention that formulated our Constitution;\nWhereas Lieutenant General George Washington twice served as President of the United States of America; and\nWhereas it is considered fitting and proper that no officer of the United States Army should outrank Lieutenant General George Washington on the Army list;\nNow, therefore, be it\n:''Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled'', That\n: (a) for purposes of subsection (b) of this section only, the grade of General of the Armies of the United States is established, such grade to have rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present.\n: (b) The President is authorized and requested to appoint George Washington posthumously to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States, such appointment to take effect on July 4, 1976.<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW---->\n''Approved October 11, 1976''<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW---->.<br />\n[[s:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]]}}\n\n==Campaigns for appointment as General of the Armies==\n\n===Douglas MacArthur===\n[[File:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was proposed for promotion to rank in 1945.]]\n\nGeneral of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] was considered for appointment to the rank of General of the Armies both during and after World War II, but a formal promotion order for his appointment \"to the office of General of the Armies of the United States\" was never issued.<ref name=\"SJRes-MacArthur\">Senate Joint Resolution 26 of January 21, 1955</ref><ref>[[:File:Douglas MacArthur promotion order to General of the Armies.jpg|84th Congress 1st session, S.J.Res.26]]</ref>  Supporters of MacArthur would lobby for over two decades to have the general promoted to \"six-star general\".\n\n====World War II====\nAs part of the preparation for [[Operation Downfall]] (the planned invasion of Japan), the United States War Department began drawing up invasion manpower requirements for a large force organized into several Navy fleets and Army groups. The Army also saw the need for a possible promotion of more officers to the rank of General of the Army, depending on the size of the invasion force, as well as the participation of American allies in the Pacific (such as the [[Royal Navy]], [[Red Army]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Army]]) all of which maintained their own equivalents to five-star rank.\n\nIt became obvious that the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|supreme commander]] for the attack of Japan would hold an enormous amount of power and would command an invasion force larger than any seen to date in the Second World War. It was also clear that whoever this commander was would have direct command authority of not one, but several five-star officers. To that end, a proposal was discussed in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to appoint Douglas MacArthur to the rank of \"General of the Armies\" and have this position be considered a six-star general rank.\n\nThe Army draft for the promotion specified three key points regarding the renewed proposal for General of the Armies:\n# The position would clearly be a six-star general rank\n# The rank would be senior to General of the Army\n# The rank would require a new insignia which incorporated a sixth star into the five-star design of General of the Army.\n\nAt the beginning of August 1945, a member of MacArthur's staff drew a single sketch of a five-star general insignia superimposed in its center with a sixth star of rank.<ref>Burke, C.J., \"The ambiguous case for six star general\", Look Magazine, 15 Jul 1960</ref>  This sketch was the first known design for a \"six-star general\" insignia, but just a few weeks later the proposal for MacArthur's promotion was dropped.<ref>Daily Operational Reports, Supreme Allied Commander - South West Pacific Area; National Archives and Records Administration, RG165 (College Park)</ref>  The United States Army formally closed the file on MacArthur's promotion on August 18, 1945, four days after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender announcement]] which rendered the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands unnecessary. MacArthur's service record was then annotated that the promotion package had been closed due to \"lack of necessity for such a rank\".<ref>Records of Service Record of Douglas MacArthur -- National Personnel Records Center.</ref>\n\n====Renewed efforts====\n[[File:Douglas MacArthur promotion order to General of the Armies.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Senate Joint Resolution for Douglas MacArthur to assume the rank of General of the Armies]]\n\nIn the early 1950s, supporters of Douglas MacArthur began to petition the United States government to authorize a \"promotion\" to the rank of General of the Armies.\n\nIn 1955, the United States Congress considered a bill authorizing President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to promote MacArthur to the rank of General of the Armies. The language used in the bill states that the rank was to be \"re-activated\" and that MacArthur was to be \"promoted\" to the position. With such terms, the Congressional legislation all but confirmed that General of the Armies was a senior rank to that of General of the Army, but Congress did not pass, or vote on, the proposed legislation.\n\nBecause of the various complications, MacArthur advised Dwight Eisenhower that he wished to decline promotion and the bill to promote MacArthur was dropped. Supporters of MacArthur continued with further petitions, however, and the MacArthur Memorial in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] possesses numerous letters from 1962 through 1964 attempting to obtain MacArthur a \"six-star promotion\". In the letters, as well as a congressional record appendix from February 1962 (pages A864-A865), this promotion was referred to as both \"six-star general\" and \"general of the armies\".\n\n====Failed posthumous promotion====\nWhen MacArthur died in 1964, proponents for his promotion petitioned both the Army and Congress to grant a posthumous promotion to General of the Armies, and even went so far as to obtain a vote of neutral support from [[Harry S. Truman]] (meaning he would neither support nor attempt to scuttle the promotion).  In 1965, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Army Personnel contacted the Institute of Heraldry and requested the feasibility of creating a six star general insignia in the event that MacArthur was in fact posthumously promoted.  At the same time, the Army Personnel Office began attempting to resolve the confusion surrounding the status of General of the Armies.<ref>Army Message Traffic 5/5/64, Washington, DC; \"Request for Preliminary Designs for a 6 Star General insignia\", Office of the Chief of Staff for Personnel</ref>\n\nThe Army Personnel Office determined that, because of the number of living five-star generals still on the Army rolls in 1964, to introduce a rank of General of the Armies would require a formal regulation dealing with seniority, insignia, and retirement benefits.  The Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] also advised that, should MacArthur receive promotion to rank of General of the Armies, salary and benefits associated with the much more firmly established rank of five-star General of the Army would have to be reexamined. The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] further stated that because [[George C. Marshall]] was senior to MacArthur on the Army rolls, that should MacArthur be made a General of the Armies, a similar measure would have to be passed posthumously promoting Marshall as well (Marshall had died in 1959).\n\nDue to various logistical and administrative difficulties, as well the United States having recovered from the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] coupled with the expansion of the [[Vietnam War]], efforts to promote MacArthur were ultimately dropped and no further petitions to the Army were received after 1966.\n\n===Omar Bradley===\n[[File:General of the Army Omar Bradley.jpg|right|thumb|Omar Bradley]]\n\nUpon the death of [[Omar Bradley]] in 1981, Congress considered a special recognition to commemorate the passing of the last of the Second World War five star officers.  Six weeks after Bradley's death, the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] sent a letter to the Institute of Heraldry and the Army requesting to know the feasibility of promoting Bradley to the rank of six star general.<ref>Congressional Record 1981, Cong. 97 Sess. 1 \u2013 Parts 6-8, \"Comparison and Promotion Procedures for General of the Armies and General of the Army of the United States\".</ref> A brief was issued which repeated much of the concerns raised in 1964 when Douglas MacArthur had been considered posthumously for the rank.\n\nThe Institute of Heraldry released two insignia designs for the rank of the General of the Armies which incorporated a sixth star into the standard five star general design; a third design depicting a six star collar insignia was also proposed.  In response to a concern regarding seniority among five star officers, Congress also requested clarification as to the procedures should a United States Navy or [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] officer be promoted to six star rank.  The response to Congress stated: \"Should an officer of the [[General of the Air Force#Equivalent and senior ranks|Air Force]] or [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Navy]] be promoted to six star rank, that officer should be entitled to the six star insignia with a service specific crest\".<ref>Congressional Record 1981, Cong. 97 Sess. 1 \u2013 Part 8, \"Promotion of other service branches to General of the Armies of the United States\".</ref>\n\nThe notion of promoting Bradley was never agreed upon within Congress and by 1982 the proposal had been dropped.  There have been no further efforts since to promote an officer of the United States Army to the rank of General of the Armies of the United States.\n\n==Chronology==\n* June 1775: George Washington appointed as General and Commander-in-Chief\n* November 1783: Highest rank in the United States' military declared as Major General\n* March 1799: Congress proposes George Washington be appointed as \"General of the Armies of the United States\"\n* December 1799: Washington dies; proposal to promote to higher rank is dropped\n* March 1855: [[Winfield Scott]] promoted to Lieutenant General, technically the same rank as George Washington\n* April 1861: The [[American Civil War]] begins\n* July 1866: Congress established the rank of \"General of the Army of the United States\" and promotes [[Ulysses Grant]] to the position\n* March 1869: [[William Sherman]] promoted to General of the Army\n* June 1888: [[Philip Sheridan]] promoted to General of the Army\n* August 1888: Sheridan dies.

The rank of General of the Armies is equivalent to the [[Admiral of the Navy]] and is senior to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]], [[General of the Air Force]], and [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:WashingtonInsig1782.jpg|thumb|right|George Washington's rank insignia as \"General and Commander-in-Chief\"]]\n\nAppointment to the rank or grade of General of the Armies of the United States has a history spanning over two centuries. In the course of its existence the authority and seniority of the rank, and perceptions by both the American public and the military establishment, have varied.  The first mention of the rank \"General of the Armies\" was in an Act of the [[United States Congress]] on March 3, 1799.  Congress provided:\n\n<blockquote>That a Commander of the United States shall be appointed and [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] by the style of General of the Armies of the United States and the present office and title of Lieutenant General shall thereafter be abolished.</blockquote>\n\nThe rank of General of the Armies was intended for bestowal upon George Washington, who held the rank of \"[[Continental Army#Rank insignia|General and Commander-in-Chief]]\" which was a grade senior to all American major generals and brigadier generals from the [[American Revolutionary War]].  However, only a few months after the Congressional proposal, Washington died on December 14, 1799.  The United States Army at that time had also drastically reduced in size and there was no practical need for a superior General rank, thus the proposal for General of the Armies was soon forgotten.\n\n===American Civil War===\n[[File:US Army General insignia (1866).svg|thumb|right|Civil War era insignia for \"General of the Army of the United States\"]]\n\nIn 1865, after the close of the [[American Civil War]], Congress again revisited the idea of a superior General rank.  The result was the creation of a special rank called \"General of the Army of the United States\", which was held by [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref name=\"Military Laws 1915\">{{cite book|title=The military laws of the United States, 1915, Volume 1, Issue 915 (also The military laws of the United States, 1915, Volume 1, Issue 915)|last=Office of the Judge Advocate General, United States Army|authorlink= |year=1915 |publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC}}</ref> This early version of General of the Army was in fact a [[four-star rank|four-star]] general officer rank although, unlike in modern times, Congress intended for only one Army officer to hold the position, thus granting the rank the same authority as the initial concept of General of the Armies. [[William T. Sherman]]<ref name=\"Military Laws 1915\"/> and [[Philip Sheridan]]<ref name=\"Military Laws 1915\"/> would also hold the position.  During Sherman's tenure, the insignia was changed to that of a [[major general]] superimposed upon a golden national eagle.\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:General of Armies insignia.svg|thumb|right|John Pershing's gold star insignia]]\n\nThe rank of General of the Army of the United States ceased to exist upon the death of Sheridan in 1888. The next proposal to create a superior general rank would occur thirty-one years later during the [[First World War]]. In the interim, the highest possible general officer rank of the United States Army was that of two-star major general.  Within the [[United States Navy]], three- and four-star ranks continued into the 20th century, leading to the creation of the [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]] rank in 1899. [[George Dewey]] was appointed this rank which, at the time of its creation, was considered a four-star admiral with an added honorary title.  A comparison between Admiral of the Navy and General of the Armies was first made in 1944, although the rank of Admiral of the Navy was never declared equal in seniority.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[United States Congress]] authorized the appointment of three-star lieutenant generals and four-star generals to be granted temporarily for service in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]]. [[Tasker H. Bliss]] and [[John J. Pershing]] were promoted to general in October 1917, and [[Peyton C. March]] was promoted to that rank in May 1918. [[Hunter Liggett]] and [[Robert Lee Bullard]] were both promoted to lieutenant general on October 16, 1918.  In 1919, by Congressional directive, the rank of General of the Armies was formally established and John J. Pershing became the first person to hold the rank.\n\nAfter the close of the First World War, the highest active grade in the U.S. Army again became major general, with all lieutenant generals and generals (except for Pershing) reverted to this permanent rank of major general.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1920/06/30/archives/only-major-generals-now-march-liggett-and-bullard-lose-war-rank4.html Only Major Generals Now; March, Liggett and Bullard Lose War Rank] The New York Times, June 30, 1920</ref> Pershing then retired from the United States Army on September 13, 1924, and retained his rank on the U.S. Army retirement rolls until his death in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/FAQ-5star.htm|title=How many U.S. Army five-star generals have there been and who were they?|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}</ref> Four-star generals were reauthorized in 1929, starting with [[Charles Pelot Summerall]]. Pershing at this time was no longer on active duty, but his rank was regarded as senior to a full general outside the regular promotion tier.\n\n===Second World War===\nOn December 14, 1944, the United States Army established a five-star general position and named this new rank \"General of the Army\", which was a title that had not been used since the 1880s after the Civil War. Unlike the Civil War version, this new rank was clearly a five-star position, whereas the old version was considered a four-star rank; the five-star rank was also intended to be held by more than one person rather than a single supreme rank for the head of the U.S. Army.\n\n[[File:6 Star.svg|thumb|Insignia for six star general]]\n\n===General of the Armies===\n\nPershing was still living during World War II, although he was over eighty years old when the United States entered the war. Nevertheless, the question was immediately raised by both the media and the public as to whether Pershing's rank \"fit in\" with the new five-star position. It was decided that Pershing would outrank all five-star generals by order of seniority, meaning that even if he did not have a higher rank, he was considered senior by virtue of an earlier date of promotion into that rank. There was still rampant speculation, however, that Pershing was a six-star general, and the media put the matter directly to the War Department for a clear and concise answer.\n\nIn response to a direct question as to whether Pershing held six-star rank, the then [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[Henry L. Stimson]] stated:\n\n<blockquote>It appears the intent of the Army was to make the General of the Armies senior in grade to the General of the Army. I have advised Congress that the War Department concurs in such proposed action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/armyorank/blgoa.htm |accessdate=17 August 2014 |title=General of the Armies of the United States and General of the Army of the United States |work=US Military |publisher=About.com |date=2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Together we served\">{{cite web |url=https://army.togetherweserved.com/army/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person&ID=7151 |accessdate=17 August 2014 |title=Pershing, John, GEN |work=Together we Served |publisher= |date=2011 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe situation with Pershing was seemingly solved, but the matter of a six-star general in the United States military would reappear in only a few months during the summer of 1945 at which time [[Douglas MacArthur]] was proposed for promotion to General of the Armies.  Efforts to promote MacArthur, although never successful, would continue for the next twenty years and lapse only with his death in 1964.\n\n===Developments since the 1970s===\n[[File:U.S. Army O-12 shoulderboard, rotated (1981\u20132015).png|thumb|Proposed insignia for General of the Armies as published in 1981 following the death of Omar Bradley]]\n\nThe rank of General of the Armies was revisited with a posthumous promotion of George Washington in 1976.<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW----> In 1981, upon the death of [[Omar Bradley]], brief consideration was given for another posthumous promotion; however, no action was taken beyond designing a potential \"modern day\" insignia for General of the Armies.\n\nThe most recent reference to the rank of General of the Armies occurred in 2008 when the Army authorized the [[Army Service Uniform]] as the new standard uniform for United States soldiers.  As part of the first presentations of the uniform to Army leadership, the [[Institute of Heraldry]] created an insignia chart with officer ranks ranging from [[Second lieutenant]] to General of the Armies of the United States.<ref>\"IOH chart shows five- and six-star generals\", Army Times (2008)</ref>\n\n==Officers appointed as General of the Armies==\n\n===John J.

As of 1782, when Washington was listed as a lieutenant general on the rolls of the [[United States Army]], his rank was informally called \"three-star general\".  The United States at this point had no four-star general rank and would not until 1866.  At that time, the European rank of [[captain general]] was shortened to simply \"general\"; there would also be no lieutenant generals in the American army until Winfield Scott was \"[[Brevet (military)|brevetted]]\" to the rank of lieutenant general in 1855.\n\n[[File:Orders 31-3.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The [[s:File:Orders 31-3.jpg|formal promotion order]] signed by [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Clifford Alexander, Jr.]]]]\nOn March 13, 1978, Washington was posthumously promoted to the full grade of ''General of the Armies of the United States'', with effective date from July 4, 1976.<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW---->\n\nThe [[s:File:Orders 31-3.jpg|formal promotion order]] signed by [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Clifford Alexander, Jr.]], simply formalized the promotion.  It did not mention six-star status, nor did it include, as the legislation did, the phrasing \"such grade to have rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\".  The legislation implicitly clarified the relationship of Washington's rank to Pershing's.  Public Law 94-479, which codified the rank of General of the Armies of the United States, did not create a separate rank from Pershing's but rather simply clarified that, while Washington and Pershing held the same rank, Washington was to be considered senior.\n\n====Promotion legislation====\n{{quote|Whereas Lieutenant General George Washington of Virginia commanded our armies throughout and to the successful termination of our Revolutionary War;\nWhereas Lieutenant General George Washington presided over the convention that formulated our Constitution;\nWhereas Lieutenant General George Washington twice served as President of the United States of America; and\nWhereas it is considered fitting and proper that no officer of the United States Army should outrank Lieutenant General George Washington on the Army list;\nNow, therefore, be it\n:''Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled'', That\n: (a) for purposes of subsection (b) of this section only, the grade of General of the Armies of the United States is established, such grade to have rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present.\n: (b) The President is authorized and requested to appoint George Washington posthumously to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States, such appointment to take effect on July 4, 1976.<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW---->\n''Approved October 11, 1976''<!---DO NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR TO 1776. 1976 IS THE CORRECT YEAR FOR THIS LAW---->.<br />\n[[s:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]]}}\n\n==Campaigns for appointment as General of the Armies==\n\n===Douglas MacArthur===\n[[File:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was proposed for promotion to rank in 1945.]]\n\nGeneral of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] was considered for appointment to the rank of General of the Armies both during and after World War II, but a formal promotion order for his appointment \"to the office of General of the Armies of the United States\" was never issued.<ref name=\"SJRes-MacArthur\">Senate Joint Resolution 26 of January 21, 1955</ref><ref>[[:File:Douglas MacArthur promotion order to General of the Armies.jpg|84th Congress 1st session, S.J.Res.26]]</ref>  Supporters of MacArthur would lobby for over two decades to have the general promoted to \"six-star general\".\n\n====World War II====\nAs part of the preparation for [[Operation Downfall]] (the planned invasion of Japan), the United States War Department began drawing up invasion manpower requirements for a large force organized into several Navy fleets and Army groups. The Army also saw the need for a possible promotion of more officers to the rank of General of the Army, depending on the size of the invasion force, as well as the participation of American allies in the Pacific (such as the [[Royal Navy]], [[Red Army]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Army]]) all of which maintained their own equivalents to five-star rank.\n\nIt became obvious that the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|supreme commander]] for the attack of Japan would hold an enormous amount of power and would command an invasion force larger than any seen to date in the Second World War. It was also clear that whoever this commander was would have direct command authority of not one, but several five-star officers. To that end, a proposal was discussed in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to appoint Douglas MacArthur to the rank of \"General of the Armies\" and have this position be considered a six-star general rank.\n\nThe Army draft for the promotion specified three key points regarding the renewed proposal for General of the Armies:\n# The position would clearly be a six-star general rank\n# The rank would be senior to General of the Army\n# The rank would require a new insignia which incorporated a sixth star into the five-star design of General of the Army.\n\nAt the beginning of August 1945, a member of MacArthur's staff drew a single sketch of a five star general insignia superimposed in its center with a sixth star of rank.<ref>Burke, C.J., \"The ambiguous case for six star general\", Look Magazine, 15 Jul 1960</ref>  This sketch was the first known design for a \"six star general\" insignia, but just a few weeks later the proposal for MacArthur's promotion was dropped.<ref>Daily Operational Reports, Supreme Allied Commander - South West Pacific Area; National Archives and Records Administration, RG165 (College Park)</ref>  The United States Army formally closed the file on MacArthur's promotion on August 18, 1945, four days after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender announcement]] which rendered the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands unnecessary. MacArthur's service record was then annotated that the promotion package had been closed due to \"lack of necessity for such a rank\".<ref>Records of Service Record of Douglas MacArthur -- National Personnel Records Center.</ref>\n\n====Renewed efforts====\n[[File:Douglas MacArthur promotion order to General of the Armies.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Senate Joint Resolution for Douglas MacArthur to assume the rank of General of the Armies]]\n\nIn the early 1950s, supporters of Douglas MacArthur began to petition the United States government to authorize a \"promotion\" to the rank of General of the Armies.\n\nIn 1955, the United States Congress considered a bill authorizing President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to promote MacArthur to the rank of General of the Armies. The language used in the bill states that the rank was to be \"re-activated\" and that MacArthur was to be \"promoted\" to the position. With such terms, the Congressional legislation all but confirmed that General of the Armies was a senior rank to that of General of the Army, but Congress did not pass, or vote on, the proposed legislation.\n\nBecause of the various complications, MacArthur advised Dwight Eisenhower that he wished to decline promotion and the bill to promote MacArthur was dropped. Supporters of MacArthur continued with further petitions, however, and the MacArthur Memorial in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] possesses numerous letters from 1962 through 1964 attempting to obtain MacArthur a \"six-star promotion\". In the letters, as well as a congressional record appendix from February 1962 (pages A864-A865), this promotion was referred to as both \"six-star general\" and \"general of the armies\".\n\n====Failed posthumous promotion====\nWhen MacArthur died in 1964, proponents for his promotion petitioned both the Army and Congress to grant a posthumous promotion to General of the Armies, and even went so far as to obtain a vote of neutral support from [[Harry S. Truman]] (meaning he would neither support nor attempt to scuttle the promotion).  In 1965, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Army Personnel contacted the Institute of Heraldry and requested the feasibility of creating a six star general insignia in the event that MacArthur was in fact posthumously promoted.  At the same time, the Army Personnel Office began attempting to resolve the confusion surrounding the status of General of the Armies.<ref>Army Message Traffic 5/5/64, Washington, DC; \"Request for Preliminary Designs for a 6 Star General insignia\", Office of the Chief of Staff for Personnel</ref>\n\nThe Army Personnel Office determined that, because of the number of living five-star generals still on the Army rolls in 1964, to introduce a rank of General of the Armies would require a formal regulation dealing with seniority, insignia, and retirement benefits.  The Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] also advised that, should MacArthur receive promotion to rank of General of the Armies, salary and benefits associated with the much more firmly established rank of five-star General of the Army would have to be reexamined. The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] further stated that because [[George C. Marshall]] was senior to MacArthur on the Army rolls, that should MacArthur be made a General of the Armies, a similar measure would have to be passed posthumously promoting Marshall as well (Marshall had died in 1959).\n\nDue to various logistical and administrative difficulties, as well the United States having recovered from the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] coupled with the expansion of the [[Vietnam War]], efforts to promote MacArthur were ultimately dropped and no further petitions to the Army were received after 1966.\n\n===Omar Bradley===\n[[File:General of the Army Omar Bradley.jpg|right|thumb|Omar Bradley]]\n\nUpon the death of [[Omar Bradley]] in 1981, Congress considered a special recognition to commemorate the passing of the last of the Second World War five star officers.  Six weeks after Bradley's death, the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] sent a letter to the Institute of Heraldry and the Army requesting to know the feasibility of promoting Bradley to the rank of six star general.<ref>Congressional Record 1981, Cong. 97 Sess. 1 \u2013 Parts 6-8, \"Comparison and Promotion Procedures for General of the Armies and General of the Army of the United States\".</ref> A brief was issued which repeated much of the concerns raised in 1964 when Douglas MacArthur had been considered posthumously for the rank.\n\nThe Institute of Heraldry released two insignia designs for the rank of the General of the Armies which incorporated a sixth star into the standard five star general design; a third design depicting a six star collar insignia was also proposed.  In response to a concern regarding seniority among five star officers, Congress also requested clarification as to the procedures should a United States Navy or [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] officer be promoted to six star rank.  The response to Congress stated: \"Should an officer of the [[General of the Air Force#Equivalent and senior ranks|Air Force]] or [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Navy]] be promoted to six star rank, that officer should be entitled to the six star insignia with a service specific crest\".<ref>Congressional Record 1981, Cong. 97 Sess. 1 \u2013 Part 8, \"Promotion of other service branches to General of the Armies of the United States\".</ref>\n\nThe notion of promoting Bradley was never agreed upon within Congress and by 1982 the proposal had been dropped.
