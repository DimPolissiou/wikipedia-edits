In a major product shift in the Ford truck lineup, the F-250 and F-350 were split from the F-150. Beginning production in early-1998 (model year 1999) the newly branded [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] trucks had a distinct body and chassis, while still branded as F-Series trucks.\n\nThis generation of the F-Series was also sold by Lincoln as the [[Lincoln Blackwood|Blackwood]] for the model year 2002 (2002-2003 in Mexico). In Mexico, the F-150 was rebranded as the '''Ford Lobo''' from 2004 to 2010, when it was replaced by the [[Ford F-Series twelfth generation|twelfth-generation model]].\n\n== Development ==\nIn late 1989, during mid-stage development of a facelift due in late-1991 for model year 1992, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] commenced the PN-96 program on a new truck platform and designated Thomas Baughman as chief engineer. In mid-1990, Andrew Jacobson was designated as design director for the PN-96 truck program. By 1991, designers had developed clay models indicative of car like styling, based on a new design theme. Despite the disapproval from focus groups towards \"softer\" styling, during 1991 and 1992 in concept design clinics, Ford management backed the \"aero\" design philosophy. The end result by Bob Aikins reached in November 1992 and frozen for production in February 1993, took the aero styling further with a rounded nose on the new F-series. The PN-96 mules went into testing 1993, with prototypes running from early 1994.

A new [[Ford Lightning|Lightning]] was introduced in March 1999, and [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[King Ranch]] versions were also created for the 2000 and 2001 model years, respectively. In 2000, the SuperCrew cab was introduced with four full-size doors for the 2001 model year. A Sport 4x4 model was introduced in 2000 as well. It featured the 5.4L Triton V8 and color-matched bumpers and mirror housings, and was available in regular cab and SuperCab in four colors: white, red, black, and silver. In 2002, an FX4 model was introduced, which came with skid plates, a carbon steel frame, [[Tenneco Automotive|Rancho]] shock absorbers, and unique 17\" aluminum wheels along with more standard features that were optional on XLT. In 2003, a sporty STX trim package was introduced, aimed at younger truck buyers. The STX package featured color-keyed front/rear bumpers along with clear lens headlights and integrated round fog lamps. The package also featured chrome step rails, 17\" chrome wheels, and a Kenwood Z828 stereo was installed in place of the standard Ford radio. Also in 2003, a special trim package \"Heritage Edition\" version with special badging was produced to mark the 100th anniversary of Ford trucks, available only in the 139\" wheelbase SuperCab model.\n\nSales of the F-150 surged in the tenth generation from 750,000 to over 900,000 in 2001 as products from [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] lagged. Ford's sales dropped, however, for the final years of this generation as the redesigned [[Dodge Ram]] and refreshed [[Chevrolet Silverado]] were released.\n\nThe new F-150 was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/truck/truck_of_the_year_winners/index.html |title=Truck of the Year Winners List |work=Motor Trend}}</ref>  A minor facelift was introduced September 1998, with minor interior updates for 1999 models including a revised instrument cluster and a new door panel design to incorporate the 4th additional door. In February 2000, the SuperCrew was added to the lineup early in the 2001 MY (Model Year), entering production on December 13, 2000. Ford also manufactured a limited run of \"Heritage\" (differentiated from the 2003 \"Heritage Edition\") F-150s of the 2003 body style to August 2004 as 2004 models to finish out production.<ref>http://www.carenthusiast.com/2000/shows/la2000/articles/ford/f150_1.html</ref><ref>http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/supercrew-may-force-ford-juggle-mix</ref><ref>https://www.fleet.ford.com/truckbbas/topics/whatnew2000.html#f150</ref>\n\nThis generation of F-150 was sold in Mexico alongside the new [[Ford_F-Series_(eleventh_generation)|11th generation]] F-Series through 2008. It was only available as a Regular Cab and in XL trim, while the newer model was available in more trims, SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations and the new model was badged as Lobo, while the older model retained the F-150 name.\n\n==Powertrain==\nA new lineup of improved efficiency engines were offered beginning for 1997. A 4.2 L OHV [[V6 engine|V6]], based on Ford's [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8 L Essex V6]], replaced the 4.9 L OHV [[Straight-six engine|I6]], while 4.6 and 5.4 liter SOHC V8s replaced the 5.0 and 5.8 liter [[Ford small block engine|OHV V8s]]. The 4.6 and 5.4 liter V8s were marketed under the name Triton and mark the first use of Ford's [[Ford Modular engine|Modular]] [[Single overhead camshaft|Single Overhead Cam (SOHC)]] engines in the F-series pickups. Ford's own 8.8 IFS replaced the [[Dana 44]] front end, while the Ford 8.8 rear remained. The Ford Sterling 9.75 axle was also optioned in heavy-duty versions. In 2000, the [[Sterling 10.5 axle|Sterling 10.25 axle]] became an option.\n\nEngines:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Engine\n! Years\n! Power\n! Torque\n!

Ignition was later blamed on spillage from the adjacent master cylinder. On March 5, 2007 Ford recalled 155,000 2003 full-size pickups and full-size SUVs for the defective part. During the previous two years Ford had recalled 5.8 million vehicles in because of the defective cruise control systems in trucks, SUVs and [[van]]s.

To bridge the gap between the F-150 and the heavier-duty pickups, a PN96 version of the F-250 light-duty was introduced nearly a year later (though also a 1997 model), slotted between the F-150 and the F-250HD of the previous-generation chassis.  While nearly externally identical to the F-150, the F-250 gained increased load capability from a [[Sterling 10.5 axle|heavy-duty rear axle]] and load-leveling rear suspension; the F-250 was distinguished by 7-lug wheels.\n\nThe PN-96 F-250 light-duty was marketed from 1997 to 1999, with Ford offering two generations of the vehicle under the same nameplate. For 1999, the F-250HD and F-350 were replaced by the [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] F-Series; the suspension components of the PN-96 F-250 continued as a \"7700\" option package from 2000 to 2003.\n\n===SVT Lightning (1999-2004)===\n[[File:Ford-F150-SVT-Lightning.jpg|thumb|2001-2003 Ford F-150 SVT Lightning]]The '''Ford SVT Lightning''' is a [[sport car|sports]]/performance version of the F-150, developed by the [[Ford SVT|SVT]] (Special Vehicle Team) division of Ford.  For 1999, the second generation of the Lightning was released using the PN96 platform, after a three-year hiatus of the model line.  As with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the Lightning was based on the F-150; all versions were produced with a regular cab, rear-wheel drive, and a 6\u00bd-foot bed length.  In sharp contrast to its predecessor, the 1999-2002 Lightning was given a payload of 800 pounds (half the payload of a Ranger); for 2003, the figure was raised to 1,350 pounds.\n\nWhile the first-generation Lightning chassis was a hybrid of the F-150 and F-250, to save weight and lower its cost, the second-generation adopted the stock F-150 frame.  To improve handling, while the stock [[Double wishbone suspension|short/long arm]] front suspension configuration was used, the Lighting was lowered one inch with a 31mm stabilizer bar; the rear solid axle with leaf springs was lowered two inches, using a 23mm stabilizer bar.  Monroe shocks were used from 1999 to 2001; Bilstein shocks were used from 2002 to 2004. In place of the 17-inch wheels of its predecessor, the second-generation Lightning was given 18-inch wheels with Goodyear Eagle F1 directional tires developed for the truck.\n\nThe second-generation Lightning was powered by a 5.4 L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Triton]] SOHC V8 equipped with an Eaton M112 supercharger.

From 1999 to 2000, the rear axle ratio was 3.55:1, shortened to 3.75:1 in 2001.  The same year, a 4.5-inch aluminum driveshaft replaced a 3.5-inch steel unit.\n\nFollowing the 2001 drivetrain revisions, ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine tested a Lightning, accelerating from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 5.2 seconds.\n\nDuring its production, the 1999-2004 was offered in a limited variety of colors.

Brought into production after a positive reception to a 1999 concept vehicle, the Blackwood was a variant of the Ford F-150 SuperCrew introduced for 2001.\n\nStyled with the front fascia of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV, the Blackwood diverged from the F-150 in terms of functionality.  In place of a pickup bed, the Blackwood was given a stainless-steel cargo area lined with carpet covered with a power-operated [[Tonneau cover|tonneau]]; the plastic body panels of the pickup bed were styled as black wood with pinstripes.  To match the simulated wood design of the pickup bed, Lincoln offered black as the only body color for the Blackwood.  Sharing its interior with the Navigator, the Blackwood was fitted with four seats (with a center console between the rear seats).\n\nEquipped only with rear-wheel drive, the Blackwood shared its 300 hp 5.4L 32-valve V8 with the Navigator.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{gallery\n|File:2003 Ford F150 Front.jpg|Ford F-150 Flareside\n|File:Ford F-150 King Ranch.jpg|2001-2003 Ford F-150 King Ranch SuperCrew\n|File:Ford F-150 Harley Davidson -- 02-16-2010.jpg|Ford F-150 Harley Davidson\n|File:Ford F-150 ext cab long bed.jpg|1999\u20132004 Ford F-150 SuperCab long bed\n|File:'97-'98 Ford F-150 XLT Extended Cab.JPG|1997\u20131998 Ford F-150 SuperCab XLT\n|File:2003FordF150.jpg|2003 F-150 Super Crew Off Road 4\u00d74\n|}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Ford vehicles}}\n{{Ford F-Series}}\n{{Modern North American Ford trucks}}\n{{Ford Motor Company vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Ford F-Series|10th generation]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{main|Ford F-Series}}\n{{infobox automobile\n| name=Tenth generation (PN-96)\n| image=Ford F-150 XL regular cab.jpg\n| production = November 29, 1995\u2013August 2004<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.dailypress.com/1995-12-06/business/9512060124_1_norfolk-plant-nation-s-best-selling-vehicle-ford-s-automotive-operations |title=Today's Focus: Tough And Ready |date=December 6, 1995 |first=Ken |last=Baker |newspaper=Daily Press |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}</ref><br>July 1996\u20131999 (F-250)<ref>http://www.autonews.com/article/19960513/ANA/605130761/fords-expedition-takes-on-tahoe-seeks-conquest-sales</ref><br>1996-2009 (Mexico)\n| model_years = 1997\u20132004<br>1997\u20131999 (F-250)\n| designer = Andrew Jacobson; Bob Aikins (concept: 1992, production design: 1993)<ref name=\"Ford Truck Design 1991\">{{cite news|last1=Louie|first1=Elaine|title=Currents; Students' Trucks Are Carlike|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/12/garden/currents-students-trucks-are-carlike.html |date=December 12, 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"PN-96 Development\">{{cite web|title=How Ford's F 150 Lapped The Competition|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1996-07-28/how-fords-f-150-lapped-the-competition |website=Businessweek |date=July 29, 1996 |first=Keith |last=Naughton |accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>\n| manufacturer = [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]<br>[[F4 layout|4WD layout]] \n| related=[[Lincoln Blackwood]]<br>[[Ford Expedition]]<br>[[Lincoln Navigator]]\n| assembly={{ubl| [[Ford Kansas City Assembly Plant|Kansas City Assembly]] ([[Kansas City, Missouri]]) | [[Norfolk Assembly]] ([[Norfolk, Virginia]]) | [[Kentucky Truck Assembly]] ([[Louisville, Kentucky]]) | [[Oakville Assembly]] ([[Oakville, Ontario]], Canada) | [[Cuautitl\u00e1n Assembly]] ([[Cuautitlan]], Mexico) | [[Valencia Assembly]] ([[Valencia, Venezuela]])}} \n| engine={{ubl| 4.2&nbsp;L [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)#4.2|Essex]] V6 \n| 4.6&nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#4.6|Triton]] V8 | 5.4&nbsp;L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4|Triton]] V8 }}\n| body_style={{ubl|2-door [[pickup truck#Standard cab|Regular cab pickup]] \n| 2+1-door [[pickup truck#Extended cab|Extended cab pickup]]| 2+2-door [[pickup truck#Extended cab|Extended cab pickup]]\n| 4-door [[Crew cab|Crew cab pickup]]}}\n\n|class=[[Pickup truck#Full-size pickups|Full-size pickup truck]]\n| platform=[[Ford P platform]]\n| aka=Ford Lobo (Mexico) <br>Ford F-250 (Mexico) <br>Ford F150 Heritage (2004 Only)\n| transmission={{ubl|4-speed ''[[Ford AOD transmission#4R70W|4R70W]]'' automatic| 4-speed ''[[Ford C6 transmission#E4OD|E4OD]]'' automatic (1997-1998 Only)(5.4L only)| 4-speed ''[[Ford C6 transmission#4R100|4R100]]'' automatic (1999 and up)(5.4L only)| 5-speed ''[[Mazda M5OD transmission|M5OD-R2]]'' manual}}\n|wheelbase=Regular cab/6.5' bed: {{convert|119.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> Regular cab/8' bed, SuperCab/6.5' bed, and SuperCrew: {{convert|138.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> SuperCab/8' bed: {{convert|157.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length= Regular cab/6.5' bed: {{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> Regular cab/8' bed, SuperCab/6.5' bed, and SuperCrew: {{convert|222.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> SuperCab/8' bed: {{convert|239.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width= {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|72.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (4x2) <br /> {{convert|75.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (4x4)\n|predecessor= [[Ford F-Series ninth generation]] (1992\u20131996)\n|successor= [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation]] (2004\u20132008)\n}}\n\nThe '''tenth generation of the [[Ford F-Series]]''' is a line of pickup trucks produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1996 to 2004; it was sold from model years 1997 to 2004. In a major product shift in the Ford truck lineup, the F-250 and F-350 were split from the F-150. Beginning production in early-1998 (model year 1999) the newly branded [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] trucks had a distinct body and chassis, while still branded as F-Series trucks.\n\nThis generation of the F-Series was also sold by Lincoln as the [[Lincoln Blackwood|Blackwood]] for the model year 2002 (2002-2003 in Mexico). In Mexico, the F-150 was rebranded as the '''Ford Lobo''' from 2004 to 2010, when it was replaced by the [[Ford F-Series twelfth generation|twelfth-generation model]].\n\n== Development ==\nIn late 1989, during mid-stage development of a facelift due in late-1991 for model year 1992, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] commenced the PN-96 program on a new truck platform and designated Thomas Baughman as chief engineer. In mid-1990, Andrew Jacobson was designated as design director for the PN-96 truck program. By 1991, designers had developed clay models indicative of car like styling, based on a new design theme. Despite the disapproval from focus groups towards \"softer\" styling, during 1991 and 1992 in concept design clinics, Ford management backed the \"aero\" design philosophy. The end result by Bob Aikins reached in November 1992 and frozen for production in February 1993, took the aero styling further with a rounded nose on the new F-series. The PN-96 mules went into testing 1993, with prototypes running from early 1994.

A new [[Ford Lightning|Lightning]] was introduced in March 1999, and [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[King Ranch]] versions were also created for the 2000 and 2001 model years, respectively. In 2000, the SuperCrew cab was introduced with four full-size doors for the 2001 model year. A Sport 4x4 model was introduced in 2000 as well. It featured the 5.4L Triton V8 and color-matched bumpers and mirror housings, and was available in regular cab and SuperCab in four colors: white, red, black, and silver. In 2002, an FX4 model was introduced, which came with skid plates, a carbon steel frame, [[Tenneco Automotive|Rancho]] shock absorbers, and unique 17\" aluminum wheels along with more standard features that were optional on XLT. In 2003, a sporty STX trim package was introduced, aimed at younger truck buyers. The STX package featured color-keyed front/rear bumpers along with clear lens headlights and integrated round fog lamps. The package also featured chrome step rails, 17\" chrome wheels, and a Kenwood Z828 stereo was installed in place of the standard Ford radio. Also in 2003, a special trim package \"Heritage Edition\" version with special badging was produced to mark the 100th anniversary of Ford trucks, available only in the 139\" wheelbase SuperCab model.\n\nSales of the F-150 surged in the tenth generation from 750,000 to over 900,000 in 2001 as products from [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] lagged. Ford's sales dropped, however, for the final years of this generation as the redesigned [[Dodge Ram]] and refreshed [[Chevrolet Silverado]] were released.\n\nThe new F-150 was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/truck/truck_of_the_year_winners/index.html |title=Truck of the Year Winners List |work=Motor Trend}}</ref>  A minor facelift was introduced September 1998, with minor interior updates for 1999 models including a revised instrument cluster and a new door panel design to incorporate the 4th additional door. In February 2000, the SuperCrew was added to the lineup early in the 2001 MY (Model Year), entering production on December 13, 2000. Ford also manufactured a limited run of \"Heritage\" (differentiated from the 2003 \"Heritage Edition\") F-150s of the 2003 body style to August 2004 as 2004 models to finish out production.<ref>http://www.carenthusiast.com/2000/shows/la2000/articles/ford/f150_1.html</ref><ref>http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/supercrew-may-force-ford-juggle-mix</ref><ref>https://www.fleet.ford.com/truckbbas/topics/whatnew2000.html#f150</ref>\n\nThis generation of F-150 was sold in Mexico alongside the new [[Ford_F-Series_(eleventh_generation)|11th generation]] F-Series through 2008. It was only available as a Regular Cab and in XL trim, while the newer model was available in more trims, SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations and the new model was badged as Lobo, while the older model retained the F-150 name.\n\n==Powertrain==\nA new lineup of improved efficiency engines were offered beginning for 1997. A 4.2 L OHV [[V6 engine|V6]], based on Ford's [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8 L Essex V6]], replaced the 4.9 L OHV [[Straight-six engine|I6]], while 4.6 and 5.4 liter SOHC V8s replaced the 5.0 and 5.8 liter [[Ford small block engine|OHV V8s]]. The 4.6 and 5.4 liter V8s were marketed under the name Triton and mark the first use of Ford's [[Ford Modular engine|Modular]] [[Single overhead camshaft|Single Overhead Cam (SOHC)]] engines in the F-series pickups. Ford's own 8.8 IFS replaced the [[Dana 44]] front end, while the Ford 8.8 rear remained. The Ford Sterling 9.75 axle was also optioned in heavy-duty versions.

To bridge the gap between the F-150 and the heavier-duty pickups, a PN96 version of the F-250 light-duty was introduced nearly a year later (though also a 1997 model), slotted between the F-150 and the F-250HD of the previous-generation chassis.  While nearly externally identical to the F-150, the F-250 gained increased load capability from a [[Sterling 10.5 axle|heavy-duty rear axle]] and load-leveling rear suspension; the F-250 was distinguished by 7-lug wheels.\n\nThe PN-96 F-250 light-duty was marketed from 1997 to 1999, with Ford offering two generations of the vehicle under the same nameplate. For 1999, the F-250HD and F-350 were replaced by the [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] F-Series; the suspension components of the PN-96 F-250 continued as a \"7700\" option package from 2000 to 2003.\n\n===SVT Lightning (1999-2004)===\n[[File:Ford-F150-SVT-Lightning.jpg|thumb|2001-2003 Ford F-150 SVT Lightning]]The '''Ford SVT Lightning''' is a [[sport car|sports]]/performance version of the F-150, developed by the [[Ford SVT|SVT]] (Special Vehicle Team) division of Ford.  For 1999, the second generation of the Lightning was released using the PN96 platform, after a three-year hiatus of the model line.  As with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the Lightning was based on the F-150; all versions were produced with a regular cab, rear-wheel drive, and a 6\u00bd-foot bed length.  In sharp contrast to its predecessor, the 1999-2002 Lightning was given a payload of 800 pounds (half the payload of a Ranger); for 2003, the figure was raised to 1,350 pounds.\n\nWhile the first-generation Lightning chassis was a hybrid of the F-150 and F-250, to save weight and lower its cost, the second-generation adopted the stock F-150 frame.  To improve handling, while the stock [[Double wishbone suspension|short/long arm]] front suspension configuration was used, the Lighting was lowered one inch with a 31mm stabilizer bar; the rear solid axle with leaf springs was lowered two inches, using a 23mm stabilizer bar.

Brought into production after a positive reception to a 1999 concept vehicle, the Blackwood was a variant of the Ford F-150 SuperCrew introduced for 2001.\n\nStyled with the front fascia of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV, the Blackwood diverged from the F-150 in terms of functionality.  In place of a pickup bed, the Blackwood was given a stainless-steel cargo area lined with carpet covered with a power-operated [[Tonneau cover|tonneau]]; the plastic body panels of the pickup bed were styled as black wood with pinstripes.  To match the simulated wood design of the pickup bed, Lincoln offered black as the only body color for the Blackwood.  Sharing its interior with the Navigator, the Blackwood was fitted with four seats (with a center console between the rear seats).\n\nEquipped only with rear-wheel drive, the Blackwood shared its 300 hp 5.4L 32-valve V8 with the Navigator.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{gallery\n|File:2003 Ford F150 Front.jpg|Ford F-150 Flareside\n|File:Ford F-150 King Ranch.jpg|2001-2003 Ford F-150 King Ranch SuperCrew\n|File:Ford F-150 Harley Davidson -- 02-16-2010.jpg|Ford F-150 Harley Davidson\n|File:Ford F-150 ext cab long bed.jpg|1999\u20132004 Ford F-150 SuperCab long bed\n|File:'97-'98 Ford F-150 XLT Extended Cab.JPG|1997\u20131998 Ford F-150 SuperCab XLT\n|File:2003FordF150.jpg|2003 F-150 Super Crew Off Road 4\u00d74\n|}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Ford vehicles}}\n{{Ford F-Series}}\n{{Modern North American Ford trucks}}\n{{Ford Motor Company vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Ford F-Series|10th generation]]\n[[Category:Pickup trucks]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Flexible-fuel vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1996]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \"groaning\" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what's happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there's a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

T.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \"groaning\" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what's happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there's a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist [[Kai Hansen]], bassist [[Markus Grosskopf]], guitarist [[Michael Weikath]], and drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]]. After the release of a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled EP]] and their debut album ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]'' in 1985, it expanded into a [[quintet]] with the addition of singer [[Michael Kiske]], Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the [[Keeper of the Seven Keys|''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' albums]] (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. Hansen left the band soon after the release of ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II|Part II]]'' and was replaced by [[Roland Grapow]]. After leaving Helloween, Hansen formed [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]].\n\nHelloween's first two albums without Hansen, ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' (1991) and ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' (1993), were commercial and critical failures,<ref name=official/> which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske. They were replaced by [[Uli Kusch]] and [[Andi Deris]] respectively. The albums released under this line-up, ''[[Master of the Rings]]'' (1994), ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' (1996), ''[[Better Than Raw]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Dark Ride]]'' (2000), received warmer reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again.\n\nHowever, tensions led to the dismissals in 2001 of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] together. Grapow was replaced by [[Sascha Gerstner]], but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and finally, Mikkey Dee recorded the drums for the next album ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]] in 2005. Under this line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]'' (2005), ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'' (2007), ''[[7 Sinners]]'' (2010), and ''[[Straight Out of Hell]]'' (2013). Their fifteenth and latest studio album, ''[[My God-Given Right]]'', was released on 29 May 2015.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the band announced that both Kai Hansen and Michael Kiske were rejoining Helloween for the Pumpkins United World Tour that would take place from October 2017 to December 2018. The tour ended up being the biggest one in the band's history as it comprised 69 shows and lasted for 14 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sonicperspectives.com/news/helloween-release-first-live-single-video-upcoming-blu-ray-dvd-pumpkins-united/|title=HELLOWEEN Release First Live Single/Video From Upcoming Blu Ray/DVD 'Pumpkins United'|website=Sonicperspectives.com|date=2 August 2019}}</ref> On 4 October 2019 the live album ''[[United Alive in Madrid]]'' and the live [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] ''United Alive'' were released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2019/10/helloween-united-alive-now-now-band-release-new-live-video-for-future-world/|title=HELLOWEEN &#124; \u2018United Alive band release new live video for \u2018Future World|date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The reunited line-up perdured after the tour, with a new studio album planned for a 2020 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|title=Officiale website for Pumpkins United|accessdate=14 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233944/http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Unbeatable>{{cite web|title=UNBEATABLE! |url=https://www.facebook.com/helloweenofficial/photos/a.10154216113858907/10155764840363907/?type=3&theater |website=Helloween's official [[Facebook]]|date=August 21, 2018| accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince its inception, Helloween has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than eight million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helloween.org/band/history.html|title=Helloween: Band History|accessdate=29 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002931/http://helloween.org/band/history.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years and first album (1984\u20131986) ===\nHelloween formed in 1984 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The original line-up included [[Kai Hansen]] on vocals and rhythm guitar, [[Michael Weikath]] on lead guitar, [[Markus Grosskopf]] on bass, and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] on drums. That year, the band signed with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called ''[[Death Metal (Split album)|Death Metal]]''. The compilation featured the bands [[Hellhammer]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], and [[Dark Avenger (band)|Dark Avenger]]. The two tracks were \"Oernst of Life\" by Weikath and Hansen's \"Metal Invaders,\" a faster version of which would appear on the band's first full-length album.\n\nHelloween recorded and released its first record in 1985, a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled]] EP containing five tracks. Also that year, the band released its first full-length album, ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]''.  During the following concert tour, Hansen had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time.  Kai's last recording as the band's lead singer was in 1986 on a vinyl EP titled ''Judas'', which contained the song \"Judas\" and live versions of \"Ride the Sky\" and \"Guardians\" recorded at Gelsenkirchen. (The CD edition has the live introduction, but the songs have been replaced with studio versions and crowd noise spliced in.) Following these releases, Helloween began the search for a new vocalist.\n\n=== ''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' (1986\u20131989) ===\nThe band found an 18-year-old vocalist, [[Michael Kiske]], from a local Hamburg band named Ill Prophecy. With their new lead vocalist in tow, Helloween approached record labels Noise International and RCA and proposed the release of a double-LP to introduce the line-up. This proposition was turned down. Instead, they recorded a single LP, ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I]]'', which was released in 1987. In 1988, Helloween released ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II]]'', the companion album. [[MTV]] put the single \"[[I Want Out]]\" into heavy rotation and in support of its \"[[Headbanger's Ball]]\" show. MTV also presented the inaugural [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with Helloween joining [[San Francisco Bay area]] thrash-metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] in support of headlining act [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. The band was slotted in the prestigious second spot, right before Anthrax's set. On the heels of this exposure to US audiences, the band achieved worldwide success.\n\n=== Hansen and Kiske's departures (1989\u20131993) ===\nGuitarist Kai Hansen unexpectedly left the band in 1989 soon after the European leg of the ''Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II'' tour, due to ill-health, conflicts within the band, troubles with Noise International, and a growing dissatisfaction with life on tour. Weikath chose his friend [[Roland Grapow]] to replace him, including for the rest of the tour. Grapow, who was a [[Auto mechanic|car mechanic]] at the time, stated in 2017 that, if Weikath had not happened to ask him to join the band, he would have kept his job and given up on his dream of becoming a professional musician.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROLAND GRAPOW Says HELLOWEEN Doesn't Want Him To Take Part In 'Pumpkins United' Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/roland-grapow-says-helloween-doesnt-want-him-to-take-part-in-pumpkins-united-tour/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=20 August 2017|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the band released a live album called ''[[Live in the U.K.]]'' (''Keepers Live'' in Japan and ''I Want Out Live'' in the United States), featuring material from its 1988 European tour. The remaining members continued on but ran into label problems with Noise, and after litigation kept them from touring and releasing new material, they were eventually released from their contract. A new album would not appear until 1991 when, after several rumors about the band breaking up, they released ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' for their new record company, EMI. The album was less heavy and, with song titles such as \"Heavy Metal Hamsters\", \"I'm Doing Fine, Crazy Man\", and \"Shit and Lobster\", showed a shift toward&nbsp;\u2013 and an emphasis on&nbsp;\u2013 humor rather than the epic moods on previous releases. As a result, ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' failed both commercially and critically, and tensions started to build amongst the band members.<ref name=official>{{cite web|title=Official Helloween Website: History |url=http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |accessdate=2009-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415013244/http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe pop-influenced follow-up ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' was released in 1993. Instead of taking a heavier approach, the band ventured into new territory, eschewing its signature double-guitar harmonies for synthesizers, horns, acoustic guitars, a children's chorus, country music, and swing. As with the previous album, ''Chameleon'' failed commercially and critically.<ref name=official/> Tensions within Helloween worsened, and the band split into three factions, with Michael Kiske and Ingo Schwichtenberg on one side, Michael Weikath and Roland Grapow on the other, and Markus Grosskopf in the middle, trying to keep peace between the four men.\n\nShortly after, the band began to disintegrate. During the ''Chameleon'' tour, the band would often play to half-filled venues. Drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] fell ill due to mental and drug-related issues, and was eventually fired, replaced by session drummer [[Ritchie Abdel-Nabi]]. Meanwhile, the conflicts within the rest of the band worsened, with Michael Weikath refusing to work any longer with Michael Kiske. The decision was made to fire Kiske. Since his firing, Kiske didn't get along with Helloween for many years, until 2016, when they announced that Kiske and Kai Hansen would rejoin the band for the Pumpkins United World Tour in 2017/2018. In May 2008, Kiske released ''[[Past in Different Ways]]''; an album featuring most of his old Helloween songs, albeit rearranged and re-recorded acoustically. Commenting on Kiske's dismissal, Grosskopf later said:<ref name=MRmarkus>{{cite web|last1=Syrjala|first1=Marko|title=Helloween \u2013 bassist Markus Grosskopf|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2011/01/11/helloween-bassist-markus-grosskopf/|website=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|People thought we were crazy for firing a singer like Kiske, but then after all those years and listening to what he's doing now I hope people will understand why we did that decision.  Otherwise he would have pushed us into the direction where he is going now and we didn't want that.}}\n\nIn addition to the firing of Kiske, Abdel-Nabi, whose inability to replicate Schwichtenberg's machine-gun style of drumming hindered Helloween's ability to play live fan-favorites like \"Eagle Fly Free\" and \"How Many Tears\", was let go by the band. 1993 would come to a close for Helloween with no singer, no drummer, and no record contract (EMI released the band from its agreement for the low sales numbers for ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' and ''Chameleon'').\n\n=== First years with Andi Deris (1994\u20132000) ===\nHelloween returned in 1994 with former [[Pink Cream 69]] frontman [[Andi Deris]] as their new lead vocalist and [[Uli Kusch]], formerly of Kai Hansen's [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], on drums. The band already knew Deris from some recording sessions in Hamburg.<ref name=MRmarkus/> He had been approached by Weikath to join the band in 1991, but he had declined, despite being intrigued by the offer and having to deal with emerging conflicts between him and his band. In the years since, however, Kiske was fired from Helloween and the issues within Pink Cream 69 worsened. Faced with the inevitability of his firing, Deris accepted Weikath's offer during a night out with the band members.<ref name=MRmarkus/> With this new lineup and a new record contract with Castle Communications, Helloween released its comeback album, ''[[Master of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn 1995, original drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in his native Hamburg.  In the years since his departure from Helloween, Schwichtenberg had gotten involved in drug-use and suffered from depression. 1996's ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' was dedicated to his memory. Following another world tour, a double live album called ''[[High Live]]'' was released. In 1998, Helloween released ''[[Better Than Raw]]'', one of the band's heaviest albums since the full-length debut. The subsequent supporting tour was made up of stops in Europe, Japan, and Brazil, but on 20 December 1998, the band visited New York and played a show at the venue Coney Island High in Manhattan, the first show for Helloween in the United States in nearly a decade.  The band would follow ''Better Than Raw'' with a 1999 release titled ''[[Metal Jukebox]]'', a cover-album featuring Helloween's versions of songs from such bands as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Beatles]], [[ABBA]], and [[Deep Purple]].\n\n===Line-up changes (2002\u20132004)===\nThe year 2000 saw the release of ''[[The Dark Ride]]'', a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch.<ref name=MRmarkus/> One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.\n\nThey were replaced by guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] (ex-[[Freedom Call]], Neumond) and drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (ex-[[Metalium]], [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], [[At Vance]], [[Firewind]]), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'', in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer [[Charlie Bauerfeind]]. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\"<ref name=MRmarkus/> Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated:\n\n{{cquote|I felt very secure in Helloween. In the middle of the tour I said something to Michael and Markus and I said my opinion about something. I wanted to make something the best for the band and I think they misunderstood me, like I wanted to be leader. I was telling the truth and that's how I am... It was a great time in Helloween... but I am happy when I left the band after Dark Ride because it's one of my favourite albums, it changed my life totally.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=MASTERPLAN's Roland Grapow \u2013 \"I Think HELLOWEEN Would Be Much Bigger If They Would Continue with the Style of Keepers Albums\"; New Audio Interview Online|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/193811|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=BW&BK|date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview With MASTERPLAN Mainman And Ex-HELLOWEEN Roland Grapow|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2012/11/15/interview-with-masterplan-mainman-and-ex-helloween-roland-grapow/|last=Fayyazi|first=Mohsen|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Metal Shock Finland|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nCross could not finish the album due to [[EBV infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s [[Mikkey Dee]]. [[Stefan Schwarzmann]], former drummer of [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]] would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \"Starlight\", \"Murderer\", \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" and \"How Many Tears\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.\n\n=== Steady line-up (2005\u20132016) ===\n[[File:2011-08 Woodstock 56.jpg|thumb|Helloween at [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2011]]\n2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the \"Rabbits on the Run\" tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts,<ref name=MRmarkus/> so he was replaced by [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]], the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they inked a deal with German label [[SPV GmbH|SPV]]. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween's new studio album, titled ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys - The Legacy]]'', was released on 28 October 2005 in Germany, and 8 November in the US to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, \"[[Mrs. God]]\", as well as a video for the track. The track \"[[Light the Universe]]\" was released as a single on 22 November, featuring [[Candice Night]] of [[Blackmore's Night]] on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.\n\nIn late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Sofia]] (Bulgaria), and Tokyo (Japan) for their live album ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys \u2013 The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006]]''. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band, as well as interviews and a road movie. This was the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman, and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) & 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |title=HELLOWEEN: 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' Live DVD/CD Chart Positions Revealed |publisher=BlabberMouth |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310175150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nHelloween has since completed their studio album ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'', which was released on 23 October 2007. It received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris-era albums. Despite being one of Helloween's heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. \"[[As Long as I Fall]]\", the first single, was released in early September and only available via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/media.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028224604/http://www.helloween.org/media.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Videos|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelloween teamed up with [[Kai Hansen]]'s current band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] for their 2007\u20132008 \"Hellish Rock\" world tour, which started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] were labeled as the \"very special guest\" with most shows also having fellow German \"guest\" [[Axxis]]. The tour went through Europe, Asia, and South America, as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for [[Kai Hansen]] stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits \"I Want Out\" and \"Future World\" in the last [[encore (concert)|encore]] segment of Helloween.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201092125/http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Hellish Rock 2007/2008|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=1 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 2009, Helloween released the ''[[Unarmed \u2013 Best of 25th Anniversary]]'' album in Japan. The album was released on 1 February 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of ten of the band's best known songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup. It features a seventeen-minute \"Keepers Medley\", recorded by a seventy-piece orchestra from Prague, mixing together  \"Halloween\", \"The Keeper of the Seven Keys\", and \"The King for a 1000 Years\". There is a [[limited edition]] [[digipak]], including a thirty-minute \"making of\"-DVD with interviews and studio footage. The band's website states that the album was released on 13 April 2010 in North America via Sony & THE END RECORDS labels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helloween.org/hometop/132-happy-happy-helloween.html#article |title=Helloween official website: UNARMED Best of 25th Anniversary |publisher=Helloween.org |accessdate=2011-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817192752/http://helloween.org/hometop/132-happy-happy-helloween.html#article |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 14 May 2010, it was announced on their site that they were working on a new studio album,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helloween.org/hometop/143-helloween-armed-again.html#article |title=Official Helloween website: HELLOWEEN ARMED AGAIN! |publisher=Helloween.org |accessdate=2011-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817192805/http://helloween.org/hometop/143-helloween-armed-again.html#article |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which was the fastest and heaviest effort in years.\n\nHelloween released their thirteenth studio album, ''[[7 Sinners]]'', on 31 October in Europe and 3 November in the US.

Gentry. Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist [[Kai Hansen]], bassist [[Markus Grosskopf]], guitarist [[Michael Weikath]], and drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]]. After the release of a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled EP]] and their debut album ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]'' in 1985, it expanded into a [[quintet]] with the addition of singer [[Michael Kiske]], Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the [[Keeper of the Seven Keys|''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' albums]] (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. Hansen left the band soon after the release of ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II|Part II]]'' and was replaced by [[Roland Grapow]]. After leaving Helloween, Hansen formed [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]].\n\nHelloween's first two albums without Hansen, ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' (1991) and ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' (1993), were commercial and critical failures,<ref name=official/> which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske. They were replaced by [[Uli Kusch]] and [[Andi Deris]] respectively. The albums released under this line-up, ''[[Master of the Rings]]'' (1994), ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' (1996), ''[[Better Than Raw]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Dark Ride]]'' (2000), received warmer reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again.\n\nHowever, tensions led to the dismissals in 2001 of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] together. Grapow was replaced by [[Sascha Gerstner]], but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and finally, Mikkey Dee recorded the drums for the next album ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]] in 2005. Under this line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]'' (2005), ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'' (2007), ''[[7 Sinners]]'' (2010), and ''[[Straight Out of Hell]]'' (2013). Their fifteenth and latest studio album, ''[[My God-Given Right]]'', was released on 29 May 2015.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the band announced that both Kai Hansen and Michael Kiske were rejoining Helloween for the Pumpkins United World Tour that would take place from October 2017 to December 2018. The tour ended up being the biggest one in the band's history as it comprised 69 shows and lasted for 14 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sonicperspectives.com/news/helloween-release-first-live-single-video-upcoming-blu-ray-dvd-pumpkins-united/|title=HELLOWEEN Release First Live Single/Video From Upcoming Blu Ray/DVD 'Pumpkins United'|website=Sonicperspectives.com|date=2 August 2019}}</ref> On 4 October 2019 the live album ''[[United Alive in Madrid]]'' and the live [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] ''United Alive'' were released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2019/10/helloween-united-alive-now-now-band-release-new-live-video-for-future-world/|title=HELLOWEEN &#124; \u2018United Alive band release new live video for \u2018Future World|date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The reunited line-up perdured after the tour, with a new studio album planned for a 2020 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|title=Officiale website for Pumpkins United|accessdate=14 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233944/http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Unbeatable>{{cite web|title=UNBEATABLE! |url=https://www.facebook.com/helloweenofficial/photos/a.10154216113858907/10155764840363907/?type=3&theater |website=Helloween's official [[Facebook]]|date=August 21, 2018| accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince its inception, Helloween has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than eight million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helloween.org/band/history.html|title=Helloween: Band History|accessdate=29 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002931/http://helloween.org/band/history.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years and first album (1984\u20131986) ===\nHelloween formed in 1984 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The original line-up included [[Kai Hansen]] on vocals and rhythm guitar, [[Michael Weikath]] on lead guitar, [[Markus Grosskopf]] on bass, and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] on drums. That year, the band signed with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called ''[[Death Metal (Split album)|Death Metal]]''. The compilation featured the bands [[Hellhammer]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], and [[Dark Avenger (band)|Dark Avenger]]. The two tracks were \"Oernst of Life\" by Weikath and Hansen's \"Metal Invaders,\" a faster version of which would appear on the band's first full-length album.\n\nHelloween recorded and released its first record in 1985, a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled]] EP containing five tracks. Also that year, the band released its first full-length album, ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]''.  During the following concert tour, Hansen had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time.  Kai's last recording as the band's lead singer was in 1986 on a vinyl EP titled ''Judas'', which contained the song \"Judas\" and live versions of \"Ride the Sky\" and \"Guardians\" recorded at Gelsenkirchen. (The CD edition has the live introduction, but the songs have been replaced with studio versions and crowd noise spliced in.) Following these releases, Helloween began the search for a new vocalist.\n\n=== ''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' (1986\u20131989) ===\nThe band found an 18-year-old vocalist, [[Michael Kiske]], from a local Hamburg band named Ill Prophecy. With their new lead vocalist in tow, Helloween approached record labels Noise International and RCA and proposed the release of a double-LP to introduce the line-up. This proposition was turned down. Instead, they recorded a single LP, ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I]]'', which was released in 1987. In 1988, Helloween released ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II]]'', the companion album. [[MTV]] put the single \"[[I Want Out]]\" into heavy rotation and in support of its \"[[Headbanger's Ball]]\" show. MTV also presented the inaugural [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with Helloween joining [[San Francisco Bay area]] thrash-metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] in support of headlining act [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. The band was slotted in the prestigious second spot, right before Anthrax's set. On the heels of this exposure to US audiences, the band achieved worldwide success.\n\n=== Hansen and Kiske's departures (1989\u20131993) ===\nGuitarist Kai Hansen unexpectedly left the band in 1989 soon after the European leg of the ''Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II'' tour, due to ill-health, conflicts within the band, troubles with Noise International, and a growing dissatisfaction with life on tour. Weikath chose his friend [[Roland Grapow]] to replace him, including for the rest of the tour. Grapow, who was a [[Auto mechanic|car mechanic]] at the time, stated in 2017 that, if Weikath had not happened to ask him to join the band, he would have kept his job and given up on his dream of becoming a professional musician.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROLAND GRAPOW Says HELLOWEEN Doesn't Want Him To Take Part In 'Pumpkins United' Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/roland-grapow-says-helloween-doesnt-want-him-to-take-part-in-pumpkins-united-tour/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=20 August 2017|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the band released a live album called ''[[Live in the U.K.]]'' (''Keepers Live'' in Japan and ''I Want Out Live'' in the United States), featuring material from its 1988 European tour. The remaining members continued on but ran into label problems with Noise, and after litigation kept them from touring and releasing new material, they were eventually released from their contract. A new album would not appear until 1991 when, after several rumors about the band breaking up, they released ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' for their new record company, EMI. The album was less heavy and, with song titles such as \"Heavy Metal Hamsters\", \"I'm Doing Fine, Crazy Man\", and \"Shit and Lobster\", showed a shift toward&nbsp;\u2013 and an emphasis on&nbsp;\u2013 humor rather than the epic moods on previous releases. As a result, ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' failed both commercially and critically, and tensions started to build amongst the band members.<ref name=official>{{cite web|title=Official Helloween Website: History |url=http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |accessdate=2009-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415013244/http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe pop-influenced follow-up ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' was released in 1993. Instead of taking a heavier approach, the band ventured into new territory, eschewing its signature double-guitar harmonies for synthesizers, horns, acoustic guitars, a children's chorus, country music, and swing. As with the previous album, ''Chameleon'' failed commercially and critically.<ref name=official/> Tensions within Helloween worsened, and the band split into three factions, with Michael Kiske and Ingo Schwichtenberg on one side, Michael Weikath and Roland Grapow on the other, and Markus Grosskopf in the middle, trying to keep peace between the four men.\n\nShortly after, the band began to disintegrate. During the ''Chameleon'' tour, the band would often play to half-filled venues. Drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] fell ill due to mental and drug-related issues, and was eventually fired, replaced by session drummer [[Ritchie Abdel-Nabi]]. Meanwhile, the conflicts within the rest of the band worsened, with Michael Weikath refusing to work any longer with Michael Kiske. The decision was made to fire Kiske. Since his firing, Kiske didn't get along with Helloween for many years, until 2016, when they announced that Kiske and Kai Hansen would rejoin the band for the Pumpkins United World Tour in 2017/2018. In May 2008, Kiske released ''[[Past in Different Ways]]''; an album featuring most of his old Helloween songs, albeit rearranged and re-recorded acoustically. Commenting on Kiske's dismissal, Grosskopf later said:<ref name=MRmarkus>{{cite web|last1=Syrjala|first1=Marko|title=Helloween \u2013 bassist Markus Grosskopf|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2011/01/11/helloween-bassist-markus-grosskopf/|website=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|People thought we were crazy for firing a singer like Kiske, but then after all those years and listening to what he's doing now I hope people will understand why we did that decision.  Otherwise he would have pushed us into the direction where he is going now and we didn't want that.}}\n\nIn addition to the firing of Kiske, Abdel-Nabi, whose inability to replicate Schwichtenberg's machine-gun style of drumming hindered Helloween's ability to play live fan-favorites like \"Eagle Fly Free\" and \"How Many Tears\", was let go by the band. 1993 would come to a close for Helloween with no singer, no drummer, and no record contract (EMI released the band from its agreement for the low sales numbers for ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' and ''Chameleon'').\n\n=== First years with Andi Deris (1994\u20132000) ===\nHelloween returned in 1994 with former [[Pink Cream 69]] frontman [[Andi Deris]] as their new lead vocalist and [[Uli Kusch]], formerly of Kai Hansen's [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], on drums. The band already knew Deris from some recording sessions in Hamburg.<ref name=MRmarkus/> He had been approached by Weikath to join the band in 1991, but he had declined, despite being intrigued by the offer and having to deal with emerging conflicts between him and his band. In the years since, however, Kiske was fired from Helloween and the issues within Pink Cream 69 worsened. Faced with the inevitability of his firing, Deris accepted Weikath's offer during a night out with the band members.<ref name=MRmarkus/> With this new lineup and a new record contract with Castle Communications, Helloween released its comeback album, ''[[Master of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn 1995, original drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in his native Hamburg.  In the years since his departure from Helloween, Schwichtenberg had gotten involved in drug-use and suffered from depression. 1996's ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' was dedicated to his memory. Following another world tour, a double live album called ''[[High Live]]'' was released. In 1998, Helloween released ''[[Better Than Raw]]'', one of the band's heaviest albums since the full-length debut. The subsequent supporting tour was made up of stops in Europe, Japan, and Brazil, but on 20 December 1998, the band visited New York and played a show at the venue Coney Island High in Manhattan, the first show for Helloween in the United States in nearly a decade.  The band would follow ''Better Than Raw'' with a 1999 release titled ''[[Metal Jukebox]]'', a cover-album featuring Helloween's versions of songs from such bands as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Beatles]], [[ABBA]], and [[Deep Purple]].\n\n===Line-up changes (2002\u20132004)===\nThe year 2000 saw the release of ''[[The Dark Ride]]'', a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch.<ref name=MRmarkus/> One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.\n\nThey were replaced by guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] (ex-[[Freedom Call]], Neumond) and drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (ex-[[Metalium]], [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], [[At Vance]], [[Firewind]]), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'', in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer [[Charlie Bauerfeind]]. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\"<ref name=MRmarkus/> Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated:\n\n{{cquote|I felt very secure in Helloween. In the middle of the tour I said something to Michael and Markus and I said my opinion about something. I wanted to make something the best for the band and I think they misunderstood me, like I wanted to be leader. I was telling the truth and that's how I am... It was a great time in Helloween... but I am happy when I left the band after Dark Ride because it's one of my favourite albums, it changed my life totally.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=MASTERPLAN's Roland Grapow \u2013 \"I Think HELLOWEEN Would Be Much Bigger If They Would Continue with the Style of Keepers Albums\"; New Audio Interview Online|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/193811|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=BW&BK|date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview With MASTERPLAN Mainman And Ex-HELLOWEEN Roland Grapow|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2012/11/15/interview-with-masterplan-mainman-and-ex-helloween-roland-grapow/|last=Fayyazi|first=Mohsen|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Metal Shock Finland|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nCross could not finish the album due to [[EBV infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s [[Mikkey Dee]]. [[Stefan Schwarzmann]], former drummer of [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]] would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \"Starlight\", \"Murderer\", \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" and \"How Many Tears\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.\n\n=== Steady line-up (2005\u20132016) ===\n[[File:2011-08 Woodstock 56.jpg|thumb|Helloween at [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2011]]\n2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the \"Rabbits on the Run\" tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts,<ref name=MRmarkus/> so he was replaced by [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]], the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they inked a deal with German label [[SPV GmbH|SPV]]. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween's new studio album, titled ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys - The Legacy]]'', was released on 28 October 2005 in Germany, and 8 November in the US to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, \"[[Mrs. God]]\", as well as a video for the track. The track \"[[Light the Universe]]\" was released as a single on 22 November, featuring [[Candice Night]] of [[Blackmore's Night]] on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.\n\nIn late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Sofia]] (Bulgaria), and Tokyo (Japan) for their live album ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys \u2013 The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006]]''. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band, as well as interviews and a road movie. This was the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman, and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) & 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |title=HELLOWEEN: 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' Live DVD/CD Chart Positions Revealed |publisher=BlabberMouth |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310175150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nHelloween has since completed their studio album ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'', which was released on 23 October 2007. It received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris-era albums. Despite being one of Helloween's heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. \"[[As Long as I Fall]]\", the first single, was released in early September and only available via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/media.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028224604/http://www.helloween.org/media.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Videos|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelloween teamed up with [[Kai Hansen]]'s current band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] for their 2007\u20132008 \"Hellish Rock\" world tour, which started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] were labeled as the \"very special guest\" with most shows also having fellow German \"guest\" [[Axxis]]. The tour went through Europe, Asia, and South America, as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for [[Kai Hansen]] stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits \"I Want Out\" and \"Future World\" in the last [[encore (concert)|encore]] segment of Helloween.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201092125/http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Hellish Rock 2007/2008|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=1 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 2009, Helloween released the ''[[Unarmed \u2013 Best of 25th Anniversary]]'' album in Japan. The album was released on 1 February 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of ten of the band's best known songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup. It features a seventeen-minute \"Keepers Medley\", recorded by a seventy-piece orchestra from Prague, mixing together  \"Halloween\", \"The Keeper of the Seven Keys\", and \"The King for a 1000 Years\". There is a [[limited edition]] [[digipak]], including a thirty-minute \"making of\"-DVD with interviews and studio footage.
