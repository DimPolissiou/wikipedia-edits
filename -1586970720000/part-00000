Before a 2002 amendment to the [[Constitution of Indonesia]], the [[President of Indonesia|President]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]] were elected by the country's top legislative body, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR).\n\nUnder the new amendment, a candidate pair is elected into office after receiving more than 50% of the vote nationally with at least 2% of the vote in more than half of the [[provinces of Indonesia]]. If no pair receives the number of votes required, the election will continue into the second round with the pairs receiving the highest and second-highest number of votes. Further regulations set by the General Election Commission (KPU) state that each pair must be nominated by a political party or coalition of parties which received at least 5% of the popular vote or 3% of the seats to the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) in the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|April legislative election]].\n\nThe incumbent president, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], was sworn into office in 2001 after the legislature impeached and removed her predecessor, president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] (often known as \"Gus Dur\"), from office. Megawati's re-election bid was challenged by four candidates, including incumbent vice president [[Hamzah Haz]]. In the first round, former [[Mutual Assistance Cabinet|cabinet]] member and retired general [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the valid ballots submitted, followed by Megawati. Yudhoyono eventually defeated Megawati with 60.62% of the valid ballots in the second round. He was inaugurated as the sixth president of Indonesia on 20 October 2004.\n\n==Background==\nIn the [[1999 Indonesian legislative election|1999 legislative election]], the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P) won the most number of seats in the DPR and became the largest faction in the MPR, the legislative body responsible for electing the [[President of Indonesia|President]]. The PDI\u2013P was led by [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], daughter of [[Sukarno]], Indonesia's first president. Megawati's supporters had expected her to be elected president by the MPR, but she failed to reach out to parties other than the [[National Awakening Party]] (PKB). Her only opponent at the time was President [[B. J. Habibie]], who came into office in May 1998, but he withdrew his candidacy after his accountability speech was rejected by the MPR. The PKB, which was led by [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], the leader of Indonesia's largest Islamic organisation [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] (NU), had also pledged to support Megawati for President. However, it became clear that Megawati did not have enough votes to back her candidacy. Additionally, [[National Mandate Party]] (PAN) leader [[Amien Rais]] and his Central Axis ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Poros Tengah''), a coalition of Islamic and reform parties, began pushing for Abdurrahman's candidacy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Thompson | first = Eric C. | title = Indonesia in Transition: the 1999 Presidential Elections | url = http://www.nbr.org/publications/briefing/pdf/brief9.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = National Bureau of Asian Research | date = December 1999 | accessdate = 20 June 2009 | postscript = . | ref = harv | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120925021128/http://www.nbr.org/publications/briefing/pdf/brief9.pdf | archive-date = 25 September 2012 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAbdurrahman eventually won the MPR's presidential election, and Megawati was elected as [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]].<ref name=\"AAS 11\">{{Harvnb|Ananta|Arifin|Suryadinata|2005|p=11|Ref=none}}</ref> As President, he repealed many of the laws enacted during the [[New Order (Indonesia)|Suharto era]] that discriminated against [[Chinese Indonesian]]s.

The survey continued until the start of the first election round on 5 July and included thirteen possible candidates for president. The first IFES survey indicated that incumbent President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] received a plurality of the votes. However, by the time of the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|April 2004 legislative election]], retired General [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] had taken the lead from Megawati after resigning from her cabinet in March.

Only parties which received at least 5% of the popular vote or 3% of seats (17 of 550 seats) in the DPR would be allowed to submit candidates. Parties that did not meet these criteria must join with other parties to meet at least one criterion.  Seven political parties met these criteria: the [[Golkar|Party of the Functional Groups]] (Golkar), the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P), the [[National Awakening Party]] (PKB), the [[United Development Party]] (PPP), the [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]] (PD), the [[Prosperous Justice Party]] (PKS), and the [[National Mandate Party]] (PAN).

Before a 2002 amendment to the [[Constitution of Indonesia]], the [[President of Indonesia|President]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]] were elected by the country's top legislative body, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR).\n\nUnder the new amendment, a candidate pair is elected into office after receiving more than 50% of the vote nationally with at least 2% of the vote in more than half of the [[provinces of Indonesia]]. If no pair receives the number of votes required, the election will continue into the second round with the pairs receiving the highest and second-highest number of votes. Further regulations set by the General Election Commission (KPU) state that each pair must be nominated by a political party or coalition of parties which received at least 5% of the popular vote or 3% of the seats to the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) in the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|April legislative election]].\n\nThe incumbent President, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], was sworn into office in 2001 after the legislature impeached and removed her predecessor, president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] (often known as \"Gus Dur\"), from office. Megawati's re-election bid was challenged by four candidates, including incumbent Vice President [[Hamzah Haz]]. In the first round, former [[Mutual Assistance Cabinet|cabinet]] member and retired General [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the valid ballots submitted, followed by Megawati. Yudhoyono eventually defeated Megawati with 60.62% of the valid ballots in the second round. He was inaugurated as the sixth President of Indonesia on 20 October 2004.\n\n==Background==\nIn the [[1999 Indonesian legislative election|1999 legislative election]], the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P) won the most number of seats in the DPR and became the largest faction in the MPR, the legislative body responsible for electing the [[President of Indonesia|President]]. The PDI\u2013P was led by [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], daughter of [[Sukarno]], Indonesia's first president. Megawati's supporters had expected her to be elected President by the MPR, but she failed to reach out to parties other than the [[National Awakening Party]] (PKB). Her only opponent at the time was President [[B. J. Habibie]], who came into office in May 1998, but he withdrew his candidacy after his accountability speech was rejected by the MPR.

Voters cast their ballots by making a hole in the ballot paper with a nail, above the photo of their preferred candidate. Because the ballot paper was handed to voters folded in half, many made the hole without unfolding the ballot, thus making two holes and invalidating their vote.

Quantum tunnelling is not predicted by the laws of [[classical mechanics]] where surmounting a potential barrier requires enough potential energy.\n\nQuantum tunnelling plays an essential role in several physical phenomena, such as the [[nuclear fusion]] that occurs in [[main sequence]] stars like the [[Sun]].<ref>{{cite book |title=College Physics |volume=2 |last=Serway |last2=Vuille |year=2008 |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-55475-2 |edition=Eighth }}</ref> It has important [[Quantum tunnelling#Applications|applications]] in the [[tunnel diode]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=J. |title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers |page=234 |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-13-805715-2 }}</ref> [[quantum computing]], and in the [[scanning tunnelling microscope]].

In other words, the uncertainty in the exact location of light particles allows these particles to break rules of classical mechanics and move in space without passing over the potential energy barrier.\n\n== History ==\nQuantum tunnelling was developed from the study of [[radioactivity]],<ref name=\"Razavy\" /> which was discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]].<ref name=\"Nimtz\">{{cite book |last=Nimtz |last2=Haibel |title=Zero Time Space |page=1 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2008 }}</ref> Radioactivity was examined further by [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]], for which they earned the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1903.<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Egon Schweidler]] studied its nature, which was later verified empirically by [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]]. The idea of the [[half-life]] and the possibility of predicting decay was created from their work.<ref name=\"Razavy\" />\n\nIn 1901, Robert Francis Earhart, while investigating the conduction of gases between closely spaced electrodes using the [[Michelson interferometer]] to measure the spacing, discovered an unexpected conduction regime. [[J. J. Thomson]] commented that the finding warranted further investigation. In 1911 and then 1914, then-graduate student Franz Rother, employing Earhart's method for controlling and measuring the electrode separation but with a sensitive platform [[galvanometer]], directly measured steady field emission currents.  In 1926, Rother, using a still newer platform galvanometer of sensitivity 26 pA, measured the [[field emission current]]s in a \"hard\" vacuum between closely spaced electrodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294260678|title=The STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope) [The forgotten contribution of Robert Francis Earhart to the discovery of quantum tunneling.]|author=Thomas Cuff|website=ResearchGate}}</ref>\n\nQuantum tunneling was first noticed in 1927 by [[Friedrich Hund]] when he was calculating the ground state of the [[double-well potential]]<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> and independently in the same year by [[Leonid Mandelstam]] and [[Mikhail Leontovich]] in their analysis of the implications of the then new [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]] for the motion of a particle in a confining potential of a limited spatial extent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Mandelstam |first2=M. |last2=Leontowitsch |title=Zur Theorie der Schr\u00f6dingerschen Gleichung |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik |volume=47 |issue= 1\u20132|pages=131\u2013136 |year=1928 |bibcode = 1928ZPhy...47..131M |doi = 10.1007/BF01391061 }}</ref> Its first application was a mathematical explanation for [[alpha decay]], which was done in 1928 by [[George Gamow]] (who was aware of the findings of Mandelstam and Leontovich<ref>{{cite journal |first=E.

This process cannot be directly perceived, but much of its understanding is shaped by the microscopic world, which [[classical mechanics]] cannot adequately explain. To understand the [[phenomenon]], particles attempting to travel between [[potential barrier]]s can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill; [[quantum mechanics]] and [[classical mechanics]] differ in their treatment of this scenario. Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier will not be able to reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. Or, lacking the energy to penetrate a wall, it would bounce back (reflection) or in the extreme case, bury itself inside the wall (absorption). In quantum mechanics, these particles can, with a very small probability, ''tunnel'' to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. Here, the \"ball\" could, in a sense, ''borrow'' energy from its surroundings to tunnel through the wall or \"roll over the hill\", paying it back by making the reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1119/1.1810153| url=http://www.quantum3000.narod.ru/papers/edu/quantum_tunelling.pdf| title=Quantum tunneling time| journal=American Journal of Physics| volume=73| issue=1| pages=23\u201327| year=2005| last1=Davies| first1=P.

One interpretation of this duality involves the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which defines a limit on how precisely the position and the [[momentum]] of a particle can be known at the same time.<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> This implies that there are no solutions with a probability of exactly zero (or one), though a solution may approach infinity if, for example, the calculation for its position was taken as a probability of 1, the other, i.e. its speed, would have to be infinity. Hence, the probability of a given particle's existence on the opposite side of an intervening barrier is non-zero, and such particles will appear on the 'other' (a semantically difficult word in this instance) side with a relative frequency proportional to this probability.\n\n[[File:EffetTunnel.gif|250px|right|thumb|An electron [[wavepacket]] directed at a potential barrier.

The solid lines represent the [[level set]] of the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] <math>H(x,p) = p^2 / 2 + U(x) </math>.]]\n\n=== The tunneling problem ===\nThe [[wave function]] of a particle summarises everything that can be known about a [[physical system]].<ref>Bjorken and Drell, \"Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\", page 2. Mcgraw-Hill College, 1965.</ref> Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics center on the analysis of the wave function for a system. Using mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], the wave function can be solved. The absolute value of this wavefunction to the power of 2 is directly related to the probability density of the particle's position, which describes the probability that the particle is at any given place. In the limit of large barriers, the probability of tunneling decreases for taller and wider barriers.\n\nFor simple tunneling-barrier models, such as the [[rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]], an analytic formulation and thus solution exists. In canonical field theory, the tunneling is described by a wave function which has an amplitude inside the tunnel; but the current is zero there because the relative phase of the amplitude of the conjugate wave function (the time derivative) is orthogonal to it.\n\nAnother way to look at is: The waves were always on BOTH side of the barrier, but on the right the waves were jiggling in opposite directions.  Suppose in the moving illustration on the right, there were another barrier further right and another wave coming FROM the right.  The waves in the middle might be stationary if the waves strike the middle at the same time or sometimes jiggling right and sometimes jiggling left depending on which incoming wave gets there most recently.  It would be like the proverbial steel balls on a string pendulum  for which the middle balls are stationary and the end balls take turns having the \"wave\" bouncing away from the \"barrier\" of the balls in the middle.  In like manner, for a right moving wave, the barrier approximately doubles the amount of the left moving wave in order to keep the wave almost zero on the right side of the barrier.\n\nIn the 2nd moving illustration at right, you can more easily see the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) at work.  A relatively narrow wave impinges on the barrier; the barrier forces it to become even taller and even narrower.  The result is: the wave becomes much more de-localized--in fact it's now on both sides of the barrier, it's wider on each side and lower in maximum amplitude but equal in total amplitude.  In both illustrations, the localization of the wave in space causes the localization of the action of the barrier in time, thus scattering the energy/momentum of the wave.\n\nProblems in real life often do not have one, so \"semiclassical\" or \"quasiclassical\" methods have been developed to give approximate solutions to these problems, like the [[WKB approximation]]. Probabilities may be derived with arbitrary precision, constrained by computational resources, via [[Feynman]]'s [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] method; such precision is seldom required in engineering practice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Related phenomena ==\nThere are several phenomena that have the same behaviour as quantum tunnelling, and thus can be accurately described by tunnelling.

Evanescent wave coupling, until recently, was only called \"tunnelling\" in quantum mechanics; now it is used in other contexts.\n\nThese effects are modelled similarly to the [[rectangular potential barrier]]. In these cases, there is one [[transmission medium]] through which the [[wave propagation|wave propagates]] that is the same or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of medium B between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a [[Rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]] by means of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has [[travelling wave]] solutions in medium A but real [[exponential function|exponential]] solutions in medium B.\n\nIn [[optics]], medium A is a vacuum while medium B is glass. In acoustics, medium A may be a liquid or gas and medium B a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle's [[total energy]] is greater than its [[potential energy]] and medium B is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete; approximations are useful in this case.\n\n== Applications ==\nTunnelling occurs with barriers of thickness around 1\u20133&nbsp;nm and smaller,<ref>{{cite book |last=Lerner |last2=Trigg |title=Encyclopedia of Physics |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 1308] |publisher=VCH |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-89573-752-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 }}</ref> but is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena. For instance, tunnelling is a source of current leakage in [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) electronics and results in the substantial power drain and heating effects that plague high-speed and mobile technology; it is considered the lower limit on how small computer chips can be made.<ref>[http://psi.phys.wits.ac.za/teaching/Connell/phys284/2005/lecture-02/lecture_02/node13.html \"Applications of tunneling\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723161704/http://psi.phys.wits.ac.za/teaching/Connell/phys284/2005/lecture-02/lecture_02/node13.html |date=23 July 2011 }}.

The temperature in stars' cores is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] and achieve [[Thermonuclear fusion]]. Quantum tunneling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier. Though this probability is still low, the extremely large number of nuclei in the core of a star is sufficient to sustain a steady fusion reaction for millions, billions, or even trillions of years \u2013 a precondition for the evolution of life in insolation habitable zones.<ref name=\"Trixler2013\">{{cite journal|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758\u20131770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmid=24039543|pmc=3768233}}</ref>\n\n=== Radioactive decay ===\n{{Main|Radioactive decay}}\nRadioactive decay is the process of emission of particles and energy from the unstable nucleus of an atom to form a stable product. This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunnelling into the nucleus is [[electron capture]]). This was the first application of quantum tunnelling and led to the first approximations. Radioactive decay is also a relevant issue for [[astrobiology]] as this consequence of quantum tunnelling is creating a constant source of energy over a large period of time for environments outside the [[circumstellar habitable zone]] where insolation would not be possible ([[Ocean#Extraterrestrial oceans|subsurface oceans]]) or effective.<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds ===\nBy including quantum tunnelling, the [[Astrochemistry|astrochemical]] syntheses of various molecules in [[interstellar cloud]]s can be explained such as the synthesis of [[Hydrogen#Elemental molecular forms|molecular hydrogen]], [[water]] ([[ice]]) and the [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic]] important [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Quantum biology ===\nQuantum tunnelling is among the central non trivial quantum effects in [[quantum biology]].

A hydrogen bond joins normal base pairs of DNA.  There exists a double well potential along a hydrogen bond separated by a potential energy barrier. It is believed that the double well potential is asymmetric with one well deeper than the other so the proton normally rests in the deeper well.

The device depends on a [[depletion layer]] between [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] and [[P-type semiconductor]]s to serve its purpose; when these are very heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. Then, when a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum at the point where the [[voltage bias]] is such that the energy level of the p and n [[conduction band]]s are the same. As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.<ref name=\"Krane\">{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Krane |title=Modern Physics |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 423] |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-471-07963-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage is increased. This peculiar property is used in some applications, like high speed devices where the characteristic tunnelling probability changes as rapidly as the bias voltage.<ref name=\"Krane\" />\n\nThe [[resonant tunnelling diode]] makes use of quantum tunnelling in a very different manner to achieve a similar result. This diode has a resonant voltage for which there is a lot of current that favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two very thin layers with a high energy conductance band very near each other. This creates a quantum [[potential well]] that has a discrete lowest [[energy level]]. When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling will occur, and the diode is in reverse bias. Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire. As the voltage is increased further tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.<ref name=\"Knight\">{{cite book |first=R.

When the tip of the STM's needle is brought very close to a conduction surface that has a voltage bias, by measuring the current of electrons that are tunnelling between the needle and the surface, the distance between the needle and the surface can be measured. By using [[Piezoelectric sensor|piezoelectric rods]] that change in size when voltage is applied over them the height of the tip can be adjusted to keep the tunnelling current constant. The time-varying voltages that are applied to these rods can be recorded and used to image the surface of the conductor.<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> STMs are accurate to 0.001&nbsp;nm, or about 1% of atomic diameter.<ref name=\"Knight\" />\n\n=== Kinetic isotope effect ===\n{{Main|Kinetic isotope effect}}In chemical kinetics, the substitution of a light isotope of an element with a heavier one typically results in a slower reaction rate.  This is generally attributed to differences in the zero-point vibrational energies for chemical bonds containing the lighter and heavier isotopes and is generally modeled using [[transition state theory]].  However, in certain cases, very large isotope effects are observed that cannot be accounted for by a semi-classical treatment of kinetic isotope effects, and quantum tunneling through the energy barrier is invoked.  [[Ronnie Bell|R. P. Bell]] has developed a modified treatment of Arrhenius kinetics that is commonly used to model this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The tunnel effect in chemistry|last=Percy)|first=Bell, R. P.

Winful argues that the wavepacket of a tunnelling particle propagates locally, so a particle can't tunnel through the barrier non-locally. Winful also argues that the experiments that are purported to show non-local propagation have been misinterpreted. In particular, the group velocity of a wavepacket does not measure its speed, but is related to the amount of time the wavepacket is stored in the barrier.\n\n== Mathematical discussions of quantum tunnelling ==\nThe following subsections discuss the mathematical formulations of quantum tunnelling.\n\n=== The Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Time independent equation 2|time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for one particle in one [[dimension]] can be written as\n\n:<math>-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) + V(x) \\Psi(x) = E \\Psi(x)</math> or\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right) \\Psi(x) \\equiv \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hbar </math> is the reduced [[Planck's constant]], m is the particle mass, x represents distance measured in the direction of motion of the particle, \u03a8 is the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function, V is the [[potential energy]] of the particle (measured relative to any convenient reference level), ''E'' is the energy of the particle that is associated with motion in the x-axis (measured relative to V), and M(x) is a quantity defined by V(x) \u2013 E which has no accepted name in physics.\n\nThe solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation take different forms for different values of x, depending on whether M(x) is positive or negative. When M(x) is constant and negative, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = -k^2 \\Psi(x),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; k^2=- \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation represent travelling waves, with phase-constant +''k'' or -''k''.\nAlternatively, if M(x) is constant and positive, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = {\\kappa}^2 \\Psi(x), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; {\\kappa}^2= \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation are rising and falling exponentials in the form of [[evanescent wave]]s.\nWhen M(x) varies with position, the same difference in behaviour occurs, depending on whether M(x) is negative or positive. It follows that the sign of M(x) determines the nature of the medium, with negative M(x) corresponding to medium A as described above and positive M(x) corresponding to medium B. It thus follows that evanescent wave coupling can occur if a region of positive M(x) is sandwiched between two regions of negative M(x), hence creating a potential barrier.\n\nThe mathematics of dealing with the situation where M(x) varies with x is difficult, except in special cases that usually do not correspond to physical reality. A discussion of the semi-classical approximate method, as found in physics textbooks, is given in the next section. A full and complicated mathematical treatment appears in the 1965 monograph by Fr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man noted below. Their ideas have not been incorporated into physics textbooks, but their corrections have little quantitative effect.\n\n=== The WKB approximation ===\n{{Main|WKB approximation}}\nThe wave function is expressed as the exponential of a function:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = e^{\\Phi(x)}</math>, where <math>\\Phi''(x) + \\Phi'(x)^2 = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right).</math>\n\n<math>\\Phi'(x)</math> is then separated into real and imaginary parts:\n\n:<math>\\Phi'(x) = A(x) + i B(x)</math>, where A(x) and B(x) are real-valued functions.\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first and using the fact that the imaginary part needs to be 0 results in:\n\n:<math>A'(x) + A(x)^2 - B(x)^2 = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)</math>.\n\nTo solve this equation using the semiclassical approximation, each function must be expanded as a [[power series]] in <math>\\hbar</math>. From the equations, the power series must start with at least an order of <math>\\hbar^{-1}</math> to satisfy the real part of the equation; for a good classical limit starting with the highest power of [[Planck's constant]] possible is preferable, which leads to\n\n:<math>A(x) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\hbar^k A_k(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>B(x) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\hbar^k B_k(x)</math>,\n\nwith the following constraints on the lowest order terms,\n\n:<math>A_0(x)^2 - B_0(x)^2 = 2m \\left( V(x) - E \\right)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>A_0(x) B_0(x) = 0</math>.\n\nAt this point two extreme cases can be considered.\n\n'''Case 1'''\nIf the amplitude varies slowly as compared to the phase <math>A_0(x) = 0</math> and\n\n::<math>B_0(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{ 2m \\left( E - V(x) \\right) }</math>\n\n:which corresponds to classical motion. Resolving the next order of expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx C \\frac{ e^{i \\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( E - V(x) \\right)} + \\theta} }{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( E - V(x) \\right)}}</math>\n\n'''Case 2'''\n:If the phase varies slowly as compared to the amplitude, <math>B_0(x) = 0</math> and\n\n::<math>A_0(x) = \\pm \\sqrt{ 2m \\left( V(x) - E \\right) }</math>\n\n:which corresponds to tunnelling. Resolving the next order of the expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx \\frac{ C_{+} e^{+\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}} + C_{-} e^{-\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}}{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}</math>\n\nIn both cases it is apparent from the denominator that both these approximate solutions are bad near the classical turning points <math>E = V(x)</math>. Away from the potential hill, the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave; beneath the potential hill, the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude. By considering the behaviour at these limits and classical turning points a global solution can be made.\n\nTo start, choose a classical turning point, <math>x_1</math> and expand <math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right)</math> in a power series about <math>x_1</math>:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1) + v_2 (x - x_1)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nKeeping only the first order term ensures linearity:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1)</math>.\n\nUsing this approximation, the equation near <math>x_1</math> becomes a [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = v_1 (x - x_1) \\Psi(x)</math>.\n\nThis can be solved using [[Airy function]]s as solutions.\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = C_A Ai\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right) + C_B Bi\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right)</math>\n\nTaking these solutions for all classical turning points, a global solution can be formed that links the limiting solutions. Given the two coefficients on one side of a classical turning point, the two coefficients on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them.\n\nHence, the Airy function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits. The relationships between <math>C,\\theta</math> and <math>C_{+},C_{-}</math> are\n\n:<math>C_{+} = \\frac{1}{2} C \\cos{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\nand\n:<math>C_{-} = - C \\sin{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\n\nWith the coefficients found, the global solution can be found. Therefore, the [[transmission coefficient (physics)|transmission coefficient]] for a particle tunnelling through a single potential barrier is\n\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\mathrm{d}x \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left[ V(x) - E \\right]}}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>x_1,x_2</math> are the two classical turning points for the potential barrier.\n\nFor a rectangular barrier, this expression is simplified to:\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(V_0-E)}(x_2-x_1)} = \\tilde V_0^{-(x_2-x_1)}</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dielectric barrier discharge]]\n* [[Field electron emission]]\n* [[Holstein\u2013Herring method]]\n* [[Proton tunneling]]\n* [[Superconducting tunnel junction]]\n* [[Tunnel diode]]\n* [[Tunnel junction]]\n* [[Quantum cloning]]\n* [[White hole]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| author=N.

Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier will not be able to reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. Or, lacking the energy to penetrate a wall, it would bounce back (reflection) or in the extreme case, bury itself inside the wall (absorption). In quantum mechanics, these particles can, with a very small probability, ''tunnel'' to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. Here, the \"ball\" could, in a sense, ''borrow'' energy from its surroundings to tunnel through the wall or \"roll over the hill\", paying it back by making the reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1119/1.1810153| url=http://www.quantum3000.narod.ru/papers/edu/quantum_tunelling.pdf| title=Quantum tunneling time| journal=American Journal of Physics| volume=73| issue=1| pages=23\u201327| year=2005| last1=Davies| first1=P.

One interpretation of this duality involves the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which defines a limit on how precisely the position and the [[momentum]] of a particle can be known at the same time.<ref name=\"Nimtz\" /> This implies that there are no solutions with a probability of exactly zero (or one), though a solution may approach infinity if, for example, the calculation for its position was taken as a probability of 1, the other, i.e. its speed, would have to be infinity. Hence, the probability of a given particle's existence on the opposite side of an intervening barrier is non-zero, and such particles will appear on the 'other' (a semantically difficult word in this instance) side with a relative frequency proportional to this probability.\n\n[[File:EffetTunnel.gif|250px|right|thumb|An electron [[wavepacket]] directed at a potential barrier.

Mcgraw-Hill College, 1965.</ref> Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics center on the analysis of the wave function for a system. Using mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, such as the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], the wave function can be solved. The absolute value of this wavefunction to the power of 2 is directly related to the probability density of the particle's position, which describes the probability that the particle is at any given place. In the limit of large barriers, the probability of tunneling decreases for taller and wider barriers.\n\nFor simple tunneling-barrier models, such as the [[rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]], an analytic formulation and thus solution exists. In canonical field theory, the tunneling is described by a wave function which has an amplitude inside the tunnel; but the current is zero there because the relative phase of the amplitude of the conjugate wave function (the time derivative) is orthogonal to it.\n\nAnother way to look at is: The waves were always on BOTH side of the barrier, but on the right the waves were jiggling in opposite directions.  Suppose in the moving illustration on the right, there were another barrier further right and another wave coming FROM the right.  The waves in the middle might be stationary if the waves strike the middle at the same time or sometimes jiggling right and sometimes jiggling left depending on which incoming wave gets there most recently.  It would be like the proverbial steel balls on a string pendulum  for which the middle balls are stationary and the end balls take turns having the \"wave\" bouncing away from the \"barrier\" of the balls in the middle.  In like manner, for a right moving wave, the barrier approximately doubles the amount of the left moving wave in order to keep the wave almost zero on the right side of the barrier.\n\nIn the 2nd moving illustration at right, you can more easily see the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) at work.  A relatively narrow wave impinges on the barrier; the barrier forces it to become even taller and even narrower.  The result is: the wave becomes much more de-localized--in fact it's now on both sides of the barrier, it's wider on each side and lower in maximum amplitude but equal in total amplitude.  In both illustrations, the localization of the wave in space causes the localization of the action of the barrier in time, thus scattering the energy/momentum of the wave.\n\nProblems in real life often do not have one, so \"semiclassical\" or \"quasiclassical\" methods have been developed to give approximate solutions to these problems, like the [[WKB approximation]]. Probabilities may be derived with arbitrary precision, constrained by computational resources, via [[Feynman]]'s [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] method; such precision is seldom required in engineering practice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Related phenomena ==\nThere are several phenomena that have the same behaviour as quantum tunnelling, and thus can be accurately described by tunnelling.

Evanescent wave coupling, until recently, was only called \"tunnelling\" in quantum mechanics; now it is used in other contexts.\n\nThese effects are modelled similarly to the [[rectangular potential barrier]]. In these cases, there is one [[transmission medium]] through which the [[wave propagation|wave propagates]] that is the same or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of medium B between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a [[Rectangular potential barrier|rectangular barrier]] by means of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has [[travelling wave]] solutions in medium A but real [[exponential function|exponential]] solutions in medium B.\n\nIn [[optics]], medium A is a vacuum while medium B is glass. In acoustics, medium A may be a liquid or gas and medium B a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle's [[total energy]] is greater than its [[potential energy]] and medium B is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete; approximations are useful in this case.\n\n== Applications ==\nTunnelling occurs with barriers of thickness around 1\u20133&nbsp;nm and smaller,<ref>{{cite book |last=Lerner |last2=Trigg |title=Encyclopedia of Physics |edition=2nd |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 1308] |publisher=VCH |location=New York |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-89573-752-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofph00lern/page/1308 }}</ref> but is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena.

The temperature in stars' cores is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]] and achieve [[Thermonuclear fusion]]. Quantum tunneling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier.

This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunnelling into the nucleus is [[electron capture]]). This was the first application of quantum tunnelling and led to the first approximations. Radioactive decay is also a relevant issue for [[astrobiology]] as this consequence of quantum tunnelling is creating a constant source of energy over a large period of time for environments outside the [[circumstellar habitable zone]] where insolation would not be possible ([[Ocean#Extraterrestrial oceans|subsurface oceans]]) or effective.<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds ===\nBy including quantum tunnelling, the [[Astrochemistry|astrochemical]] syntheses of various molecules in [[interstellar cloud]]s can be explained such as the synthesis of [[Hydrogen#Elemental molecular forms|molecular hydrogen]], [[water]] ([[ice]]) and the [[Abiogenesis|prebiotic]] important [[formaldehyde]].<ref name=\"Trixler2013\" />\n\n=== Quantum biology ===\nQuantum tunnelling is among the central non trivial quantum effects in [[quantum biology]].

A hydrogen bond joins normal base pairs of DNA.  There exists a double well potential along a hydrogen bond separated by a potential energy barrier. It is believed that the double well potential is asymmetric with one well deeper than the other so the proton normally rests in the deeper well.  For a mutation to occur, the proton must have tunnelled into the shallower of the two potential wells.

The device depends on a [[depletion layer]] between [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] and [[P-type semiconductor]]s to serve its purpose; when these are very heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. Then, when a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum at the point where the [[voltage bias]] is such that the energy level of the p and n [[conduction band]]s are the same. As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.<ref name=\"Krane\">{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Krane |title=Modern Physics |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 423] |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-471-07963-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernphysics00kran/page/423 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage is increased.

This diode has a resonant voltage for which there is a lot of current that favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two very thin layers with a high energy conductance band very near each other. This creates a quantum [[potential well]] that has a discrete lowest [[energy level]]. When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling will occur, and the diode is in reverse bias. Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire. As the voltage is increased further tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.<ref name=\"Knight\">{{cite book |first=R.

This is generally attributed to differences in the zero-point vibrational energies for chemical bonds containing the lighter and heavier isotopes and is generally modeled using [[transition state theory]].  However, in certain cases, very large isotope effects are observed that cannot be accounted for by a semi-classical treatment of kinetic isotope effects, and quantum tunneling through the energy barrier is invoked.

Winful argues that the wavepacket of a tunnelling particle propagates locally, so a particle can't tunnel through the barrier non-locally.

When M(x) is constant and negative, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = -k^2 \\Psi(x),\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; k^2=- \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation represent travelling waves, with phase-constant +''k'' or -''k''.\nAlternatively, if M(x) is constant and positive, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M(x) \\Psi(x) = {\\kappa}^2 \\Psi(x), \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\mathrm{where} \\;\\;\\; {\\kappa}^2= \\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} M. </math>\n\nThe solutions of this equation are rising and falling exponentials in the form of [[evanescent wave]]s.\nWhen M(x) varies with position, the same difference in behaviour occurs, depending on whether M(x) is negative or positive. It follows that the sign of M(x) determines the nature of the medium, with negative M(x) corresponding to medium A as described above and positive M(x) corresponding to medium B. It thus follows that evanescent wave coupling can occur if a region of positive M(x) is sandwiched between two regions of negative M(x), hence creating a potential barrier.\n\nThe mathematics of dealing with the situation where M(x) varies with x is difficult, except in special cases that usually do not correspond to physical reality. A discussion of the semi-classical approximate method, as found in physics textbooks, is given in the next section. A full and complicated mathematical treatment appears in the 1965 monograph by Fr\u00f6man and Fr\u00f6man noted below.

Resolving the next order of the expansion yields\n\n::<math>\\Psi(x) \\approx \\frac{ C_{+} e^{+\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}} + C_{-} e^{-\\int dx \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}}{\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left( V(x) - E \\right)}}</math>\n\nIn both cases it is apparent from the denominator that both these approximate solutions are bad near the classical turning points <math>E = V(x)</math>. Away from the potential hill, the particle acts similar to a free and oscillating wave; beneath the potential hill, the particle undergoes exponential changes in amplitude. By considering the behaviour at these limits and classical turning points a global solution can be made.\n\nTo start, choose a classical turning point, <math>x_1</math> and expand <math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right)</math> in a power series about <math>x_1</math>:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1) + v_2 (x - x_1)^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nKeeping only the first order term ensures linearity:\n\n:<math>\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\left(V(x)-E\\right) = v_1 (x - x_1)</math>.\n\nUsing this approximation, the equation near <math>x_1</math> becomes a [[differential equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi(x) = v_1 (x - x_1) \\Psi(x)</math>.\n\nThis can be solved using [[Airy function]]s as solutions.\n\n:<math>\\Psi(x) = C_A Ai\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right) + C_B Bi\\left( \\sqrt[3]{v_1} (x - x_1) \\right)</math>\n\nTaking these solutions for all classical turning points, a global solution can be formed that links the limiting solutions. Given the two coefficients on one side of a classical turning point, the two coefficients on the other side of a classical turning point can be determined by using this local solution to connect them.\n\nHence, the Airy function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits. The relationships between <math>C,\\theta</math> and <math>C_{+},C_{-}</math> are\n\n:<math>C_{+} = \\frac{1}{2} C \\cos{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\nand\n:<math>C_{-} = - C \\sin{\\left(\\theta - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}</math>\n\nWith the coefficients found, the global solution can be found. Therefore, the [[transmission coefficient (physics)|transmission coefficient]] for a particle tunnelling through a single potential barrier is\n\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\mathrm{d}x \\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2} \\left[ V(x) - E \\right]}}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>x_1,x_2</math> are the two classical turning points for the potential barrier.\n\nFor a rectangular barrier, this expression is simplified to:\n:<math>T(E) = e^{-2\\sqrt{\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}(V_0-E)}(x_2-x_1)} = \\tilde V_0^{-(x_2-x_1)}</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dielectric barrier discharge]]\n* [[Field electron emission]]\n* [[Holstein\u2013Herring method]]\n* [[Proton tunneling]]\n* [[Superconducting tunnel junction]]\n* [[Tunnel diode]]\n* [[Tunnel junction]]\n* [[Quantum cloning]]\n* [[White hole]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| author=N.

It forms part of the chain of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], with the [[Lombok Strait]] separating it from [[Bali]] to the west and the [[Alas Strait]] between it and [[Sumbawa]] to the east.  It is roughly circular, with a \"tail\" ([[Sekotong Peninsula]]) to the southwest, about {{convert|70|km|abbr=off}} across and a total area of about {{convert|4514|km\u00b2|abbr=off}}. The provincial capital and largest city on the island is [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]].  \n\nLombok is somewhat similar in size and density, and shares some cultural heritage with the neighboring island of [[Bali]] to the west. However, it is administratively part of West Nusa Tenggara, along with the larger and more sparsely populated island of [[Sumbawa]] to the east. Lombok is surrounded by a number of smaller islands locally called [[Gili Islands|Gili]].\n\nThe island is home to some 3.35&nbsp;million Indonesians as recorded in the decennial 2014 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marlionllc.com/lombok-ntb-demography-2014-census/|title=Lombok Island & West Nusa Tenggara Demography & Gender Ratio (Based on BPS 2014 Census)|publisher=MarlionLLC|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=19 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819231724/http://marlionllc.com/lombok-ntb-demography-2014-census/|archive-date=2017-08-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halomitrekker.com/2015/06/15-things-you-should-visit-in-lombok.html|title=15 Things You Should Visit in Lombok| date = 2015| accessdate = June 6, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://missjoaquim.com/population-of-indonesia-by-province-1971-1980-1990-1995-2000-and-2010/ |title=Population of Indonesia by Province |publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik Republik Indonesia (Statistics Indonesia) |year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822055150/http://missjoaquim.com/population-of-indonesia-by-province-1971-1980-1990-1995-2000-and-2010/ |archivedate=22 August 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"citypopulation.de\">{{cite web|title=INDONESIA: Urban City Population|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Indonesia-MU.html|work=City Population|publisher=Thomas Brinkhoff|accessdate=16 August 2012|author=Thomas Brinkhoff|date=18 February 2012}}</ref> \n\n== Administration ==\nLombok is under the administration of the Governor of the province of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] (''Nusa Tenggara Barat'').

Before this time it was made up of numerous competing and feuding petty states each of which were presided over by a Sasak 'prince'. This disunity was taken advantage of by the neighbouring Balinese who took control of western Lombok in the early seventeenth century. \n\nThe [[Makassarese]] meanwhile invaded eastern Lombok from their colonies in neighbouring [[Sumbawa]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] had first visited Lombok in 1674 and the [[Dutch East India Company]] concluded its first treaty with the Sasak Princess of Lombok. The Balinese had managed to take over the whole island by 1750, but Balinese infighting resulted in the island being split into four feuding Balinese kingdoms. In 1838, the Mataram kingdom brought its rivals under control.\n\nRelations between the [[Sasak]] and Balinese in western Lombok were largely harmonious and intermarriage was common. In the island's east, however, relations were less cordial and the Balinese maintained control from garrisoned forts. While Sasak village government remained in place, the village head became little more than a tax collector for the Balinese. Villagers became a kind of [[serf]] and Sasak aristocracy lost much of its power and land holdings.\n[[File:Lombok 1894 J. Hoynck van Papendrecht 1858 1933.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem]] against the Balinese in 1894.]]\n\nDuring one of the many Sasak peasant rebellions against the Balinese, Sasak chiefs sent envoys to the Dutch in Bali and invited them to rule Lombok. In June 1894, the governor general of the Dutch East Indies, Van der Wijck, signed a treaty with Sasak rebels in eastern Lombok. He sent a large army to Lombok and the Balinese raja capitulated to Dutch demands. (see [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem|Dutch intervention in Lombok]]) The younger princes however overruled the raja and attacked and pushed back the Dutch. The Dutch counterattacked overrunning Mataram and the raja surrendered. The entire island was annexed to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] in 1895. The Dutch ruled over Lombok's 500,000 people with a force of no more than 250 by cultivating the support of the Balinese and Sasak aristocracy. The Dutch are remembered in Lombok as liberators from Balinese hegemony.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] a Japanese invasion force comprising elements of the [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet|2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet]] invaded and occupied the Lesser Sunda Islands, including the island of Lombok. They sailed from [[Soerabaja]] harbour at 09:00 hrs on 8 March 1942 and proceeded towards Lombok Island. On 9 March 1942 at 17:00 hrs the fleet sailed into port of [[Ampenan]] on Lombok Island. The Dutch defenders were soon defeated and the island occupied.<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/lesser_sunda.html |title= The Lesser Sunda Islands 1941-1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities the Japanese forces occupying Indonesia were withdrawn and Lombok returned temporarily to Dutch control. Following the subsequent Indonesian independence from the Dutch, the Balinese and Sasak aristocracy continued to dominate Lombok. In 1958, the island was incorporated into the province of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] with Mataram becoming the provincial capital. [[Indonesian killings of 1965-66|Mass killings of communists]] occurred across the island following [[30 September Movement|the abortive coup attempt]] in Jakarta and Central Java. During [[President Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] administration (1967\u20131998), Lombok experienced a degree of stability and development but not to the extent of the boom and wealth in Java and Bali. Crop failures led to famine in 1966 and food shortages in 1973. The national government's ''[[transmigrasi]]'' program moved a lot of people out of Lombok. The 1980s saw external developers and speculators instigate a nascent tourism boom although local's share of earnings was limited. Indonesia's political and economic crises of the late 1990s hit Lombok hard. In January 2000, riots broke out across Mataram with [[Christians]] and ethnic Chinese the main victims, with alleged ''agents provocateur'' from outside Lombok. Tourism slumped, but in recent years has seen a renewed growth.\n[[File:Joko Widodo Lombok Earthquake damage.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Joko Widodo]] examining the earthquake damage.]]\n\n=== 2018 earthquakes ===\nThe [[July 2018 Lombok earthquake]] killed 20 people and injured hundreds more, the earthquake caused significant damage to Lombok island and was the foreshock of a larger earthquake that followed eight days later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/3610277/korban-jiwa-gempa-lombok-bertambah-jadi-20-orang|title=Korban Jiwa Gempa Lombok Bertambah Jadi 20 Orang|last=Liputan6.com|work=liputan6.com|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/lao-peoples-democratic-republic/asia-pacific-multiple-disasters-affect-millions-region|title=Asia Pacific: Multiple disasters affect millions in the region|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en}}</ref> The [[5 August 2018 Lombok earthquake]] had a [[moment magnitude]] of 7.0, and it caused catastrophic damage to North Lombok and also caused damage to nearby [[Bali]]; it caused over 550 deaths and more than 7000 are injured.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/05/powerful-earthquake-strikes-indonesia-killing-at-least-three |title=Indonesia earthquake: at least 91 dead after quake strikes Lombok and Bali |last=Lamb |first=Kate |date=6 August 2018 |website=The Guardian |location=London |language=en|access-date=6 August 2018}}</ref> Another Lombok earthquake occurred on [[19 August 2018 Lombok earthquake|19 August 2018]], killing 13 people and damaging 1800 buildings.<ref>https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asean/1525142/quake-swarm-jolts-indonesian-islands-killing-at-least-13</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gunung Rinjani from Gili Air 1.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Rinjani]] seen from [[Gili Air]]]]\n[[File:Mt Rinjani and segara anak lake.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Segara Anak]] on top of Mt.

The most recent eruption of Rinjani occurred in September 2016 at Gunung Barujari. In a 2010 eruption, ash was reported as rising {{convert|2|km|abbr= off}} into the atmosphere from the Barujari cone in Rinjani's caldera lake of Segara Anak. [[Lava]] flowed into the caldera lake, raising its temperature, while ash fall damaged crops on the slopes of Rinjani. The volcano and its crater lake, [[Lake Segara Anak| Segara Anak]] (child of the sea), are protected by the [[Gunung Rinjani National Park]] established in 1997.

The Head of Built Environment and Security Forest Service Forest West Nusa Tenggara Andi Pramari stated in Mataram on Wednesday, May 6, 2009 that, \"If this situation is not addressed it can be expected that within five years it may be difficult for people to obtain water in this part of NTB (West Nusa Tenggara).

Still, the island is fertile, has sufficient rainfall in most areas for agriculture, and possesses a variety of climate zones. Consequently, food in abundant quantity and variety is available inexpensively at local farmer's markets, though locals still suffer from famine due to drought and subsistence farming. A family of 4 can eat [[rice]], [[vegetables]], and [[fruit]] for as little as US$0.50. Even though a family's income may be as small as US$1.00 per day from fishing or farming, many families are able to live a contented and productive life on a low income.

The most developed tourism area of the island is on the west coast of the island and is centered about the township of [[Senggigi]]. The immediate surrounds of the township contain the most developed tourism facilities. The west coast coastal tourism strip is spread along a {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} strip following the coastal road north from [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]] and the old airport at [[Ampenan]]. The principal tourism area extends to Tanjung in the northwest at the foot of Mount Rinjani and includes the Sire and Medana Peninsulas and the highly popular [[Gili Islands]] lying immediately offshore. These three small islands are most commonly accessed by boat from Bangsal near Pemenang, Teluk Nare a little to the south, or from further south at Senggigi and Mangsit beach. Many hotels and resorts offer accommodations ranging from budget to luxurious.  Recently direct fast boat services have been running from Bali making a direct connection to the Gili islands. Although rapidly changing in character, the Gili islands still provide both a lay-back backpacker's retreat and a high-class resort destination.\n\nOther tourist destinations include [[Mount Rinjani]], Gili Bidara, Gili Lawang, [[Narmada]] [[Park]] and [[Mayura Park]] and [[Kuta (Lombok)|Kuta]] (distinctly different from Kuta, Bali).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/74276/lombok-international-airport-to-operate-soon|title=Lombok International Airport to operate soon|publisher=}}</ref> Sekotong, in southwest Lombok, is popular for its numerous and diverse scuba diving locations.\n\nThe Kuta area is also famous for its largely deserted, white sand beaches. The Smalltown is rapidly developing since the opening of the International airport in Praya. Increasing amounts of surfers from around the globe come here seeking out perfect surf and the slow and rustic feel of Lombok. South Lombok surfing is considered some of the best in the world. Large polar lows push up through the [[Indian Ocean]] directing long range, high period [[Swell (ocean)|swell]] from as far south as [[Heard Island]] from late March through to September or later. This coincided with the dry season and South-East trade winds that blow like clockwork. Lombok is famous for its diversity of breaks, which includes world-renowned ''Desert Point'' at Banko Banko in the southwest of the island.\n\nThe northern west coast near [[Tanjung, Lombok|Tanjung]] has many new upmarket [[hotel]] and [[villa]] developments centered about the Sire and Medana peninsular nearby to the Gili islands and a new boating marina at Medana Bay. These new developments complement the already existing five-star resorts and a large golf course already established there.\n\n=== Pre-1997 ===\nTourist development started in the mid-1980s when Lombok attracted attention as an 'unspoiled' alternative to Bali. Initially, low budget bungalows proliferated at places like the Gili islands and [[Kuta]], Lombok on the South Coast. These tourist accommodations were largely owned by and operated by local business entrepreneurs. Areas in proximity to the airport, places like Senggigi, experienced rampant land speculation for prime beachfront land by big businesses from outside Lombok.\n\nIn the 1990s the national government in Jakarta began to take an active role in planning for and promoting Lombok's tourism. Private organizations like the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) and the Lombok Tourism Development Corporation (LTDC) were formed. LTDC prepared detailed land use plans with maps and areas zoned for tourist facilities. Large hotels provide primary employment for the local population. Ancillary business, ranging from restaurants to art shops have been started by local businessmen. These businesses provide secondary employment for local residents.\n\n=== 1997 to 2007 ===\nThe [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] and the [[fall of Suharto]] regime in 1998 marked the beginning a decade of setbacks for tourism.

Many foreign expatriates and tourists were temporarily evacuated to Bali. Numerous foreign embassies issued Travel Warnings advising of the potential danger of traveling to Indonesia.\n\nSubsequently, the [[2002 Bali bombings]], the [[2005 Bali bombings]] and the [[Progress of the SARS outbreak]] in Asia all dramatically impacted tourism activities in Lombok. Tourism was slow to return to Lombok, provoked in part by a worldwide reluctance to travel because of global tensions.

Tourism visits to this tropical island are increasing again as both international and local tourists are re-discovering the charms of Lombok. With this new interest comes the development of a number of boutique resorts on the island providing quality accommodation, food, and drinks in near proximity to the relatively unspoiled countryside.\n\nThe Indonesian government is actively promoting both Lombok and neighboring [[Sumbawa]] as Indonesia's number two tourist destination after Bali.

It forms part of the chain of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], with the [[Lombok Strait]] separating it from [[Bali]] to the west and the [[Alas Strait]] between it and [[Sumbawa]] to the east.  It is roughly circular, with a \"tail\" ([[Sekotong Peninsula]]) to the southwest, about {{convert|70|km|abbr=off}} across and a total area of about {{convert|4514|km\u00b2|abbr=off}}. The provincial capital and largest city on the island is [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]].  \n\nLombok is somewhat similar in size and density, and shares some cultural heritage with the neighboring island of [[Bali]] to the west. However, it is administratively part of West Nusa Tenggara, along with the larger and more sparsely populated island of [[Sumbawa]] to the east. Lombok is surrounded by a number of smaller islands locally called [[Gili Islands|Gili]].\n\nThe island is home to some 3.35&nbsp;million Indonesians as recorded in the decennial 2014 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marlionllc.com/lombok-ntb-demography-2014-census/|title=Lombok Island & West Nusa Tenggara Demography & Gender Ratio (Based on BPS 2014 Census)|publisher=MarlionLLC|date=19 August 2017|accessdate=19 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819231724/http://marlionllc.com/lombok-ntb-demography-2014-census/|archive-date=2017-08-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.halomitrekker.com/2015/06/15-things-you-should-visit-in-lombok.html|title=15 Things You Should Visit in Lombok| date = 2015| accessdate = June 6, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://missjoaquim.com/population-of-indonesia-by-province-1971-1980-1990-1995-2000-and-2010/ |title=Population of Indonesia by Province |publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik Republik Indonesia (Statistics Indonesia) |year=2010 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822055150/http://missjoaquim.com/population-of-indonesia-by-province-1971-1980-1990-1995-2000-and-2010/ |archivedate=22 August 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"citypopulation.de\">{{cite web|title=INDONESIA: Urban City Population|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Indonesia-MU.html|work=City Population|publisher=Thomas Brinkhoff|accessdate=16 August 2012|author=Thomas Brinkhoff|date=18 February 2012}}</ref> \n\n== Administration ==\nLombok is under the administration of the Governor of the province of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] (''Nusa Tenggara Barat'').

Before this time it was made up of numerous competing and feuding petty states each of which were presided over by a Sasak 'prince'. This disunity was taken advantage of by the neighbouring Balinese who took control of western Lombok in the early seventeenth century. \n\nThe [[Makassarese]] meanwhile invaded eastern Lombok from their colonies in neighbouring [[Sumbawa]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] had first visited Lombok in 1674 and the [[Dutch East India Company]] concluded its first treaty with the Sasak Princess of Lombok. The Balinese had managed to take over the whole island by 1750, but Balinese infighting resulted in the island being split into four feuding Balinese kingdoms. In 1838, the Mataram kingdom brought its rivals under control.\n\nRelations between the [[Sasak]] and Balinese in western Lombok were largely harmonious and intermarriage was common. In the island's east, however, relations were less cordial and the Balinese maintained control from garrisoned forts. While Sasak village government remained in place, the village head became little more than a tax collector for the Balinese. Villagers became a kind of [[serf]] and Sasak aristocracy lost much of its power and land holdings.\n[[File:Lombok 1894 J. Hoynck van Papendrecht 1858 1933.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem]] against the Balinese in 1894.]]\n\nDuring one of the many Sasak peasant rebellions against the Balinese, Sasak chiefs sent envoys to the Dutch in Bali and invited them to rule Lombok. In June 1894, the governor general of the Dutch East Indies, Van der Wijck, signed a treaty with Sasak rebels in eastern Lombok. He sent a large army to Lombok and the Balinese raja capitulated to Dutch demands. (see [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem|Dutch intervention in Lombok]]) The younger princes however overruled the raja and attacked and pushed back the Dutch. The Dutch counterattacked overrunning Mataram and the raja surrendered. The entire island was annexed to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] in 1895. The Dutch ruled over Lombok's 500,000 people with a force of no more than 250 by cultivating the support of the Balinese and Sasak aristocracy. The Dutch are remembered in Lombok as liberators from Balinese hegemony.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] a Japanese invasion force comprising elements of the [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet|2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet]] invaded and occupied the Lesser Sunda Islands, including the island of Lombok. They sailed from [[Soerabaja]] harbour at 09:00 hrs on 8 March 1942 and proceeded towards Lombok Island. On 9 March 1942 at 17:00 hrs the fleet sailed into port of [[Ampenan]] on Lombok Island. The Dutch defenders were soon defeated and the island occupied.<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/lesser_sunda.html |title= The Lesser Sunda Islands 1941-1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities the Japanese forces occupying Indonesia were withdrawn and Lombok returned temporarily to Dutch control. Following the subsequent Indonesian independence from the Dutch, the Balinese and Sasak aristocracy continued to dominate Lombok. In 1958, the island was incorporated into the province of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] with Mataram becoming the provincial capital. [[Indonesian killings of 1965-66|Mass killings of communists]] occurred across the island following [[30 September Movement|the abortive coup attempt]] in Jakarta and Central Java. During [[President Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] administration (1967\u20131998), Lombok experienced a degree of stability and development but not to the extent of the boom and wealth in Java and Bali. Crop failures led to famine in 1966 and food shortages in 1973. The national government's ''[[transmigrasi]]'' program moved a lot of people out of Lombok. The 1980s saw external developers and speculators instigate a nascent tourism boom although local's share of earnings was limited. Indonesia's political and economic crises of the late 1990s hit Lombok hard. In January 2000, riots broke out across Mataram with [[Christians]] and ethnic Chinese the main victims, with alleged ''agents provocateur'' from outside Lombok. Tourism slumped, but in recent years has seen a renewed growth.\n[[File:Joko Widodo Lombok Earthquake damage.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Joko Widodo]] examining the earthquake damage.]]\n\n=== Earthquake disaster ===\nThe [[July 2018 Lombok earthquake]] killed 20 people and injured hundreds more, the earthquake caused significant damage to Lombok island and was the foreshock of a larger earthquake that followed eight days later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/3610277/korban-jiwa-gempa-lombok-bertambah-jadi-20-orang|title=Korban Jiwa Gempa Lombok Bertambah Jadi 20 Orang|last=Liputan6.com|work=liputan6.com|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/lao-peoples-democratic-republic/asia-pacific-multiple-disasters-affect-millions-region|title=Asia Pacific: Multiple disasters affect millions in the region|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en}}</ref> The [[5 August 2018 Lombok earthquake]] had a [[moment magnitude]] of 7.0, and it caused catastrophic damage to North Lombok and also caused damage to nearby [[Bali]]; it caused over 550 deaths and more than 7000 are injured.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/05/powerful-earthquake-strikes-indonesia-killing-at-least-three |title=Indonesia earthquake: at least 91 dead after quake strikes Lombok and Bali |last=Lamb |first=Kate |date=6 August 2018 |website=The Guardian |location=London |language=en|access-date=6 August 2018}}</ref> Another Lombok earthquake occurred on [[19 August 2018 Lombok earthquake|19 August 2018]], killing 13 people and damaging 1800 buildings.<ref>https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asean/1525142/quake-swarm-jolts-indonesian-islands-killing-at-least-13</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gunung Rinjani from Gili Air 1.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Rinjani]] seen from [[Gili Air]]]]\n[[File:Mt Rinjani and segara anak lake.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Segara Anak]] on top of Mt.

The most recent eruption of Rinjani occurred in September 2016 at Gunung Barujari. In a 2010 eruption, ash was reported as rising {{convert|2|km|abbr= off}} into the atmosphere from the Barujari cone in Rinjani's caldera lake of Segara Anak. [[Lava]] flowed into the caldera lake, raising its temperature, while ash fall damaged crops on the slopes of Rinjani. The volcano and its crater lake, [[Lake Segara Anak| Segara Anak]] (child of the sea), are protected by the [[Gunung Rinjani National Park]] established in 1997. Recent evidence indicates an ancient volcano, Mount Samalas, of which now only a caldera remains, was the source of the [[1257 Samalas eruption]], one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history, which caused worldwide changes in weather.<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Source of massive volcanic eruption found in Indonesia | newspaper = USA Today | date = September 30, 2013<!-- 5:35&nbsp;pm.

Still, the island is fertile, has sufficient rainfall in most areas for agriculture, and possesses a variety of climate zones. Consequently, food in abundant quantity and variety is available inexpensively at local farmer's markets, though locals still suffer from famine due to drought and subsistence farming. A family of 4 can eat [[rice]], [[vegetables]], and [[fruit]] for as little as US$0.50. Even though a family's income may be as small as US$1.00 per day from fishing or farming, many families are able to live a contented and productive life on a low income.

The most developed tourism area of the island is on the west coast of the island and is centered about the township of [[Senggigi]]. The immediate surrounds of the township contain the most developed tourism facilities. The west coast coastal tourism strip is spread along a {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} strip following the coastal road north from [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]] and the old airport at [[Ampenan]]. The principal tourism area extends to Tanjung in the northwest at the foot of Mount Rinjani and includes the Sire and Medana Peninsulas and the highly popular [[Gili Islands]] lying immediately offshore. These three small islands are most commonly accessed by boat from Bangsal near Pemenang, Teluk Nare a little to the south, or from further south at Senggigi and Mangsit beach. Many hotels and resorts offer accommodations ranging from budget to luxurious.  Recently direct fast boat services have been running from Bali making a direct connection to the Gili islands. Although rapidly changing in character, the Gili islands still provide both a lay-back backpacker's retreat and a high-class resort destination.\n\nOther tourist destinations include [[Mount Rinjani]], Gili Bidara, Gili Lawang, [[Narmada]] [[Park]] and [[Mayura Park]] and [[Kuta (Lombok)|Kuta]] (distinctly different from Kuta, Bali).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/74276/lombok-international-airport-to-operate-soon|title=Lombok International Airport to operate soon|publisher=}}</ref> Sekotong, in southwest Lombok, is popular for its numerous and diverse scuba diving locations.\n\nThe Kuta area is also famous for its largely deserted, white sand beaches. The Smalltown is rapidly developing since the opening of the International airport in Praya. Increasing amounts of surfers from around the globe come here seeking out perfect surf and the slow and rustic feel of Lombok. South Lombok surfing is considered some of the best in the world. Large polar lows push up through the [[Indian Ocean]] directing long range, high period [[Swell (ocean)|swell]] from as far south as [[Heard Island]] from late March through to September or later. This coincided with the dry season and South-East trade winds that blow like clockwork. Lombok is famous for its diversity of breaks, which includes world-renowned ''Desert Point'' at Banko Banko in the southwest of the island.\n\nThe northern west coast near [[Tanjung, Lombok|Tanjung]] has many new upmarket [[hotel]] and [[villa]] developments centered about the Sire and Medana peninsular nearby to the Gili islands and a new boating marina at Medana Bay. These new developments complement the already existing five-star resorts and a large golf course already established there.\n\n=== Pre-1997 ===\nTourist development started in the mid-1980s when Lombok attracted attention as an 'unspoiled' alternative to Bali. Initially, low budget bungalows proliferated at places like the Gili islands and [[Kuta]], Lombok on the South Coast. These tourist accommodations were largely owned by and operated by local business entrepreneurs. Areas in proximity to the airport, places like Senggigi, experienced rampant land speculation for prime beachfront land by big businesses from outside Lombok.\n\nIn the 1990s the national government in Jakarta began to take an active role in planning for and promoting Lombok's tourism. Private organizations like the Bali Tourism Development Corporation (BTDC) and the Lombok Tourism Development Corporation (LTDC) were formed. LTDC prepared detailed land use plans with maps and areas zoned for tourist facilities. Large hotels provide primary employment for the local population. Ancillary business, ranging from restaurants to art shops have been started by local businessmen. These businesses provide secondary employment for local residents.\n\n=== 1997 to 2007 ===\nThe [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] and the [[fall of Suharto]] regime in 1998 marked the beginning a decade of setbacks for tourism. Spurred by rapid devaluation of the currency and the transition to true democracy caused all of Indonesia to experience a period of domestic unrest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/indonesia/special_report/270462.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Analysis: Indonesia's fragile archipelago |work=BBC News |date=2000-09-13 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> Many of Indonesian Provinces struggled with elements of the population desiring autonomy or independence from the Republic of Indonesia.

Many foreign expatriates and tourists were temporarily evacuated to Bali. Numerous foreign embassies issued Travel Warnings advising of the potential danger of traveling to Indonesia.\n\nSubsequently, the [[2002 Bali bombings]], the [[2005 Bali bombings]] and the [[Progress of the SARS outbreak]] in Asia all dramatically impacted tourism activities in Lombok. Tourism was slow to return to Lombok, provoked in part by a worldwide reluctance to travel because of global tensions. Only since 2007\u20132008, when most developed countries lifted their Travel Warnings<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-05-25-indonesia-travel_N.htm|title=U.S. lifts Indonesia travel warning |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2008-05-25|accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> has tourism recovered to pre-2000 levels.\n\n=== 2008 to the present ===\nThe years leading up to 2010 has seen a rapid revival and promotion of tourism recovery in the tourism industry.

The island's natural environment and the customary hospitality of its residents make it an obvious tourist destination.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}\n\nLombok retains the allure of an undeveloped and natural environment. Tourism visits to this tropical island are increasing again as both international and local tourists are re-discovering the charms of Lombok. With this new interest comes the development of a number of boutique resorts on the island providing quality accommodation, food, and drinks in near proximity to the relatively unspoiled countryside.\n\nThe Indonesian government is actively promoting both Lombok and neighboring [[Sumbawa]] as Indonesia's number two tourist destination after Bali. Then\u2013President of Indonesia, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], Ministry of Cultural and Tourism and the regional Governor had made public statements supporting the development of Lombok as a tourism destination and setting a goal of 1 million visitors annually by the year 2012 for the combined destination of Lombok and Sumbawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/07/president-gives-full-support-tourism.html| title=President gives full support to tourism| publisher=The Jakarta Post, Senggigi, West.

She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States.\n\nBorn Sarah Margaret Fuller in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she was given a substantial early education by her father, [[Timothy Fuller]], who died in 1835 due to [[cholera]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Essential Margaret Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Margaret|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref> She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing her Conversations series: classes for women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nancy Craig|date=1994|title=Margaret Fuller's Boston Conversations: The 1839-1840 Series|journal=Studies in the American Renaissance|volume=|pages=195\u2013226|jstor=30227655}}</ref> She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1840, which was the year her writing career started to succeed<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Fuller: An American Romantic Life|last=Capper|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=X}}</ref>, before joining the staff of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' under [[Horace Greeley]] in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the [[wikt:well-read|best-read]] person in [[New England]], male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at [[Harvard College]]. Her seminal work, ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the ''Tribune'' as its first female [[correspondent]]. She soon became involved with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|revolutions in Italy]] and allied herself with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off [[Fire Island, New York]], as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.\n\nFuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. This is shown when she revolted against Boston-Cambridge\u2019s learned professions as she was barred as for entering as a girl.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Fuller:An American Romantic Life|last=Capper|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=Xi}}</ref> Fuller, along with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], wanted to stay free of what she called the \u201cstrong mental oder\u201d of female teachers <ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Fuller: An American Romantic Life|last=Capper|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=Xii}}</ref>. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including [[prison reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation of slaves]] in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend [[Harriet Martineau]].  She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and family===\n[[File:MargaretFullerHouseJuly2008.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace and childhood home of Margaret Fuller]]\nSarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23, 1810,<ref>Nelson, Randy F.

She once said, \"If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply\u2014any&nbsp;... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office\".<ref>Slater, 4</ref> She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time<ref>Blanchard, 174</ref> and disliked the popular female poets of her time.<ref>Dickenson, 172</ref> Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, \"I wish woman to live, ''first'' for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty\".<ref name=VonMehren192/> By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single.<ref>Blanchard, 135</ref> Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: \"There is no wholly masculine man&nbsp;... no purely feminine\" but that both were present in any individual.<ref name=Gura227/> She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the [[Minerva]]) and the \"lyrical\" or \"Femality\" side (the [[Muse]]).<ref>Von Mehren, 168</ref> She admired the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who believed men and women shared \"an angelic ministry\", as she wrote, as well as [[Charles Fourier]], who placed \"Woman on an entire equality with Man\".<ref name=Gura172/> Unlike several contemporary women writers, including \"[[Lydia Sigourney|Mrs. Sigourney]]\" and \"[[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]]\", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as \"Margaret\".<ref>Douglas, 261</ref>\n\nFuller also advocated reform at all levels of society, including prison. In October 1844, she visited [[Sing Sing]] and interviewed the women prisoners, even staying overnight in the facility.<ref>Gura, 229</ref> Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates, many of whom were prostitutes.<ref>Blanchard, 211</ref> Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty, especially in New York.<ref>Gura, 230</ref> She also admitted that, though she was raised to believe \"that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized\", her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage.<ref>Blanchard, 204\u2013205</ref> She also supported the rights of African-Americans, referring to \"this cancer of slavery\",<ref>Deiss, 93</ref> and suggested that those who were interested in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women: \"As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman.\"<ref>Slater, 91</ref> She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy.<ref>Deiss, 94</ref>\n\nFuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well-being of the individual,<ref>Von Mehren, 231</ref> though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist.<ref>Von Mehren, 84</ref> Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means \"that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so\".<ref>Rose, Anne C.

As he called it, it was \"rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand\".<ref>Dickenson, 41</ref>\n\nAnother admirer of Fuller was [[Susan B. Anthony]], a pioneer of women's rights, who wrote that Fuller \"possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time\".<ref>Von Mehren, 2</ref> Fuller's work may have partially inspired the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848.<ref>Dickenson, 113</ref> Anthony, along with [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] wrote in their ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'' that Fuller \"was the precursor of the Women's Rights agitation\".<ref>Stanton, Elizabeth Cady; Anthony, Susan B.  and Gage, Matilda Joslyn.

Accessed July 23, 2008</ref>\n\nFuller, however, was not without her critics. A one-time friend, the English writer [[Harriet Martineau]] was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller's death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had \"shallow conceits\" and often \"looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely&nbsp;... and despised those who, like myself, could not adopt her scale of valuation\".<ref>Dickenson, 47\u201348</ref> The influential editor [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' as \"an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female\".<ref>Bayless, Joy. ''Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor''. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943: 121</ref> New York writer [[Charles Frederick Briggs]] said that she was \"wasting the time of her readers\", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not \"truly represent the female character\".<ref>Von Mehren, 196</ref> English writer and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, \"My G\u2013d,{{sic}} what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!\"<ref>Dickenson, 47</ref> Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after ''Woman of the Nineteenth Century'' was published:<ref>Miller, Edwin Haviland.

''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 99.</ref> In response, Lowell took revenge in his [[satire|satirical]] ''[[A Fable for Critics]]'', first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called the \"most wholly negative characterization\" in the work.<ref>Von Mehren, 294</ref> Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and \"when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity 'neath her own nose\".<ref>Duberman, Martin. ''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 100.</ref>\n\nShortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded.

She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States.\n\nBorn Sarah Margaret Fuller in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she was given a substantial early education by her father, [[Timothy Fuller]], who died in 1835 due to [[cholera]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Essential Margaret Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Margaret|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref> She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing her Conversations series: classes for women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Nancy Craig|date=1994|title=Margaret Fuller's Boston Conversations: The 1839-1840 Series|journal=Studies in the American Renaissance|volume=|pages=195\u2013226|jstor=30227655}}</ref> She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal ''[[The Dial]]'' in 1840, which was the year her writing career started to succeed<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Fuller: An American Romantic Life|last=Capper|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=X}}</ref>, before joining the staff of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' under [[Horace Greeley]] in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the [[wikt:well-read|best-read]] person in [[New England]], male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at [[Harvard College]]. Her seminal work, ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'', was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the ''Tribune'' as its first female [[correspondent]]. She soon became involved with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|revolutions in Italy]] and allied herself with [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off [[Fire Island, New York]], as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.\n\nFuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. This is shown when she revolted against Boston-Cambridge\u2019s learned professions as she was barred as for entering as a girl.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Fuller:An American Romantic Life|last=Capper|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=Xi}}</ref> Fuller, along with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], wanted to stay free of what she called the \u201cstrong mental oder\u201d of female teachers <ref>{{Cite book|title=Margaret Fuller: An American Romantic Life|last=Capper|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=Xii}}</ref>. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including [[prison reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|emancipation of slaves]] in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend [[Harriet Martineau]].  She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and family===\n[[File:MargaretFullerHouseJuly2008.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace and childhood home of Margaret Fuller]]\nSarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23, 1810,<ref>Nelson, Randy F.

She once said, \"If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply\u2014any&nbsp;... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office\".<ref>Slater, 4</ref> She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time<ref>Blanchard, 174</ref> and disliked the popular female poets of her time.<ref>Dickenson, 172</ref> Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, \"I wish woman to live, ''first'' for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty\".<ref name=VonMehren192/> By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single.<ref>Blanchard, 135</ref> Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: \"There is no wholly masculine man&nbsp;... no purely feminine\" but that both were present in any individual.<ref name=Gura227/> She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the [[Minerva]]) and the \"lyrical\" or \"Femality\" side (the [[Muse]]).<ref>Von Mehren, 168</ref> She admired the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who believed men and women shared \"an angelic ministry\", as she wrote, as well as [[Charles Fourier]], who placed \"Woman on an entire equality with Man\".<ref name=Gura172/> Unlike several contemporary women writers, including \"[[Lydia Sigourney|Mrs. Sigourney]]\" and \"[[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]]\", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as \"Margaret\".<ref>Douglas, 261</ref>\n\nFuller also advocated reform at all levels of society, including prison. In October 1844, she visited [[Sing Sing]] and interviewed the women prisoners, even staying overnight in the facility.<ref>Gura, 229</ref> Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates, many of whom were prostitutes.<ref>Blanchard, 211</ref> Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty, especially in New York.<ref>Gura, 230</ref> She also admitted that, though she was raised to believe \"that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized\", her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage.<ref>Blanchard, 204\u2013205</ref> She also supported the rights of African-Americans, referring to \"this cancer of slavery\",<ref>Deiss, 93</ref> and suggested that those who were interested in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women: \"As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman.\"<ref>Slater, 91</ref> She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy.<ref>Deiss, 94</ref>\n\nFuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well-being of the individual,<ref>Von Mehren, 231</ref> though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist.<ref>Von Mehren, 84</ref> Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means \"that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so\".<ref>Rose, Anne C.

However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion.<ref>Blanchard, 125\u2013126</ref> Though Fuller occasionally attended [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion.

Dee, 1992: 111. {{ISBN|0-929587-95-2}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and, therefore, she was better off dead.<ref>Douglas, 259</ref> She also said that Fuller's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: \"The work she was preparing upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you)\".<ref>Dickenson, 44</ref> An 1860 essay collection, ''Historical Pictures Retouched'', by [[Caroline Healey Dall]], called Fuller's ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' \"doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject\".<ref>Gura, 284\u2013285</ref> Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote of the work as \"a book which few women in the country could have written, and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller\", noting its \"independence\" and \"unmitigated radicalism\".<ref name=VonMehren225/> Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller's conversational ability. As he called it, it was \"rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand\".<ref>Dickenson, 41</ref>\n\nAnother admirer of Fuller was [[Susan B. Anthony]], a pioneer of women's rights, who wrote that Fuller \"possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time\".<ref>Von Mehren, 2</ref> Fuller's work may have partially inspired the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848.<ref>Dickenson, 113</ref> Anthony, along with [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] wrote in their ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'' that Fuller \"was the precursor of the Women's Rights agitation\".<ref>Stanton, Elizabeth Cady; Anthony, Susan B.  and Gage, Matilda Joslyn. ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]'', Volume 1.

Accessed July 23, 2008</ref>\n\nFuller, however, was not without her critics. A one-time friend, the English writer [[Harriet Martineau]] was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller's death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had \"shallow conceits\" and often \"looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely&nbsp;... and despised those who, like myself, could not adopt her scale of valuation\".<ref>Dickenson, 47\u201348</ref> The influential editor [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]], who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to ''Woman in the Nineteenth Century'' as \"an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female\".<ref>Bayless, Joy. ''Rufus Wilmot Griswold: Poe's Literary Executor''. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1943: 121</ref> New York writer [[Charles Frederick Briggs]] said that she was \"wasting the time of her readers\", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not \"truly represent the female character\".<ref>Von Mehren, 196</ref> English writer and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, \"My G\u2013d,{{sic}} what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!\"<ref>Dickenson, 47</ref> Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after ''Woman of the Nineteenth Century'' was published:<ref>Miller, Edwin Haviland.

''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 99.</ref> In response, Lowell took revenge in his [[satire|satirical]] ''[[A Fable for Critics]]'', first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called the \"most wholly negative characterization\" in the work.<ref>Von Mehren, 294</ref> Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and \"when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity 'neath her own nose\".<ref>Duberman, Martin. ''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1966: 100.</ref>\n\nShortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded. Her obituary in the newspaper she had once edited, the ''Daily Tribune'', said that her works had a few great sentiments, \"but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance\".<ref>Dickenson, 40</ref> As biographer Abby Slater wrote, \"Margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept\".<ref>Slater, 3</ref> Years later, Hawthorne's son [[Julian Hawthorne|Julian]] wrote, \"The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure.\"<ref>James, Laurie.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.
