Bosworth, \"\u1e92\u0101hir al- \u02bfUmar al-Zayd\u0101n\u012b\".</ref> while the area was still nominally part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. For much of his reign, starting in the 1730s, his domain mainly consisted of [[Galilee]], with successive headquarters in [[Tiberias]], [[Arraba, Galilee|Arraba]], [[Nazareth]], [[Deir Hanna]] and finally [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], in 1746. He fortified Acre, and the city became a center of the cotton trade between Palestine and Europe. In the mid-1760s, he reestablished the port town of [[Haifa]] nearby.\n\nZahir successfully withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman governors of the [[Sidon Eyalet|Sidon]] and [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]] provinces, who attempted to limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural [[Shia Muslim]] clans of [[Jabal Amil]]. In 1771, in alliance with [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]] of the [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]] and with backing from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Zahir captured [[Sidon]], while Ali Bey's forces conquered [[Damascus]], both acts in open defiance of the [[Ottoman sultan]]. At the peak of his power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous [[sheikhdom]] extended from [[Beirut]] to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and included the Jabal Amil and [[Ajlun|Jabal Ajlun]] regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the [[Sublime Porte]] felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The [[Ottoman Navy]] attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.\n\nThe wealth Zahir accumulated through monopolizing Palestine's cotton and olive oil trade to Europe financed his sheikhdom. For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local [[fellah|peasantry]]. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged [[Arab Christian|Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants from other parts of the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the [[Al-Zayadina|Zaydani clan]], also patronized the construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine has made him a national hero among [[Palestinians]] today.<ref name=\"Joudah2nded\">{{cite journal|last1=Joudah|first1=Ahmad|title=Zahir al-'Umar and the First Autonomous Regime in Ottoman Palestine (1744-1775)|journal=Jerusalem Quarterly|date=2015|issue=63\u201364|pages=84\u201385|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/JQ%2063_Zahir%20al-Umar.pdf|publisher=Institute for Palestine Studies}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Daher arrabe2.jpg|thumb|upright|Zahir's home in [[Arraba, Galilee|Arraba]]]]\n\nZahir was born in the village of [[Arraba, Galilee|'Arrabat al-Battuf]] in central [[Galilee]].<ref name=\"Pappe35\"/><ref>Philipp, 2001, p. 30.</ref> His date of birth is not definitively known, with the years 1686, 1689/90 and 1694 cited by Zahir's contemporary biographers [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney|Volney]], Mikha'il Sabbagh and [[Khalil al-Muradi]], respectively. According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, 1689/1690 is the most likely year of his birth because he considers Sabbagh to be the most reliable source for Zahir's personal life.<ref name=\"Joudah29\">Joudah, 1987, p. 29.</ref> The proper transliteration of his given name is ''\u1e92\u0101hir'', but in the local dialect of Arabic used in Galilee, his name was pronounced ''\u1e0c\u0101hir''.<ref name=\"Joudah29\"/> Zahir's family, the [[al-Zayadina|Zaydani clan]], were [[Sunni Muslim]]<ref name=\"Harris114\">Harris, 2012, p.

Zahir was the youngest of four sons born to Sheikh [[Umar al-Zaydani]];<ref name=\"Pappe35\">Pappe, 2010, p. 35.</ref> his brothers were Sa'd, Salih \"Abu Dani\" and Yusuf, and his sister was Shammah.<ref name=Joudah139/> Zahir grew up in the village of [[Saffuriya]].<ref name=\"Pappe35\"/>\n\nZahir's father and grandfather had both served as the ''[[multazim]]'' (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the [[Druze]] [[emir]]s (princes) of the [[Maan family|Ma'an dynasty]] which governed the region from their headquarters in [[Mount Lebanon]].<ref name=\"Philip31\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA31 31]</ref> In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed ''multazim'' of the [[Safad]] region by [[Shihab dynasty#Regency of Bashir I|Bashir Shihab I]], the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the [[Mount Lebanon Emirate]].<ref name=\"Moammar43-44\">Moammar, 1990, pp.&nbsp;43\u201344.</ref> The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to [[Aleppo]] and controlled [[iltizam|tax farms]] in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of [[al-Damun]]. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became the head of the family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that in the event of a default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.<ref name=\"Philip31\"/>\n\nIn 1707, Zahir was involved in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a man. As a result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of [[Bi'ina]] was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of [[Sidon Eyalet]] sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir played an important role in defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local [[fellahin|peasantry]] throughout the 1720s.\n\nAlong with Sa'd, he also gained prestige among the people of [[Damascus]], with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father.<ref name=\"Philip31\"/> Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghaffar al-Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al-Husayni family, which provided the ''[[sharif]]s'' of Damascus at the time;<ref name=\"Philip31\"/> Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to [[Nazareth]] because she considered Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">Philipp, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA31 31]\u201332.</ref>\n\n==Rule==\n===Consolidation of power in Galilee===\n[[File:Tiberias-S-781.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the citadel at Tiberias which Zahir built early in his rule]]\n\nIn the late 1720s, Zahir and his brother Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, captured Tiberias and its ''multazim''. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Abdullah Pasha]], governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the ''multazim'' of oppression and of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him ''multazim'' of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe.<ref name=\"Joudah2223\">Joudah, 1987, pp. 22-23</ref> This was the first time a Zaydani ''multazim'' was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon.<ref name=\"Philip32\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA32 32]</ref> Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen. He appointed his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali, the ''multazim'' of al-Damun, as commander of the family militia.<ref name=\"Philip33\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA33  33]</ref>\n\nZahir extended his rule southward toward Nazareth and the [[Jezreel Valley|Marj Ibn Amer]] plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and [[Jabal Nablus]].<ref name=\"Pappe35\"/> Capturing these areas was a drawn-out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in [[Safad Sanjak]], but controlled by the [[Jarrar clan]] based in [[Nablus Sanjak]]) caused the ruling clans of the [[Samaria|Nablus hinterland]] (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to challenge him. Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, [[Maghreb]]i mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents.<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer,<ref name=\"Joudah28\">Joudah, 1987, p. 28.</ref> killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth.<ref>Doumani, 1995, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zry-tpH3rz8C&pg=PA41 41]\u201342.</ref> According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.<ref name=\"Joudah31\">Joudah, 1987, p. 31.</ref>\n\nFollowing his victory at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, including many residents of Nazareth,<ref name=\"Joudah28\"/> joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops with food and water.<ref name=\"Joudah31\"/> Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their [[throne village]] of [[Sanur, Jenin|Sanur]], but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the [[Tuqan clan|Tuqans]].<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA34 34]</ref>\n\nIn 1738, Zahir's forces captured the [[Yehi'am Fortress National Park|fortress]] at [[Khirbat Jiddin|Jiddin]] and the villages in its political orbit, [[Abu Snan]] and [[Tarshiha]].<ref name=\"Philip32\"/> Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule complained that he governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed ''multazim'' of Jiddin's subdistrict.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 23.</ref>\n\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 11832 al omari mosque in tiberias.jpg|thumb|right|The Omari Mosque in Tiberias, built by Zahir]]\n\nBi'ina, which was also fortified, withstood a siege by Zahir in 1739, but Zahir later married the daughter of Bi'ina's ''[[mukhtar]]'' (headman), and thus brought Bi'ina into his domain.<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> He also acquired the fortress of [[Suhmata]] through diplomatic means,<ref name=\"Joudah24\">Joudah, 1987, p. 24.</ref> further solidifying his rule over northern and eastern Galilee. In 1740, Zahir made an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to end their looting raids in the area. By then, Sa'd had taken control of [[Deir Hanna]] and Muhammad ibn Ali captured [[Shefa-'Amr]], entrenching the presence of the Zaydani clan in western Galilee.<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> After negotiations, Muhammad al-Naf'i, the ''multazim'' of Safad, surrendered the city to Zahir.<ref name=\"Philip32\"/> Safad was the administrative seat of the ''sanjak'' and situated on a strategic hill overlooking the Galilee countryside.<ref>Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;23\u201324.</ref> Zahir later acquired the fortified village of [[Dayr al-Qassi|Deir al-Qassi]] after marrying the daughter of its sheikh, Abd al-Khaliq Salih.<ref name=\"Joudah24\"/>\n\nZahir's conquest of the Safad region and western Galilee removed the barriers between him and the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Metawali]] (Shia Muslim) clans of [[Jabal Amil]]. Zahir informed the Metawalis' sheikh, [[Nasif al-Nassar]], of his intent to acquire the fortified villages of [[al-Bassa]] and [[Yaroun]] on the borders between the Zaydani and Metawali sheikhdoms. In response, Sheikh Nasif launched an assault against Zahir and the two sides confronted each other in indecisive skirmishes in the border village of [[Tarbikha]]. Zahir then received reinforcements from his Maghrebi cavalry and defeated the Metawalis, pursuing Sheikh Nasif to his headquarters in [[Tibnin]]. Zahir's brother Sa'd mediated an end to the fighting and secured a mutual defense pact between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif, whereby the former would receive control of al-Bassa and Yaroun and the Metawalis' support in his confrontations with the governors of Damascus; in return, Sheikh Nasif's sons, who were captured by Zahir's troops, were released, the Metawalis' tax payments to Sidon were reduced by some 25 percent, and Zahir guaranteed his backing of Sheikh Nasif in any confrontation with the governors of Sidon.<ref>Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327.</ref>\n\nZahir, similar to other local strongmen in the Ottoman Empire who did not owe their power to the central Ottoman authorities, was disliked by the Ottoman administration. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] sent an order to the governor of [[Damascus Eyalet]], [[Sulayman Pasha al-Azm]], to put an end to Zahir's rule in Galilee. In September 1742, a military force led by the governor of Damascus came to Galilee and laid siege to Tiberias. After 83 days, the siege was lifted due to the departure of the [[Hajj]] pilgrim caravan.<ref>Moammar, 1990, pp.&nbsp;71\u201382.</ref> Using this respite, Zahir reinforced the defenses of Tiberias and Shefa-'Amr. In July 1743, backed by the Bani Saqr, the ''wali'' of Tripoli and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza and [[Irbid]], Sulayman Pasha renewed his expedition, this time seeking to reduce Deir Hanna and sever Tiberias's links to the outside. Sulayman died suddenly in [[Lubya]] and Zahir used the opportunity to assault Sulayman's troops, capturing their camp.<ref name=\"Joudah\">Joudah, 1987, p. 37</ref> In 1745, Zahir had a fortress erected on a hill overlooking [[Saffuriya]].<ref>Khalidi, 1992, p. 351.</ref>\n\n===Ruler of Acre===\n[[File:Dar el omar camisi 042 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[al-Muallaq Mosque]] built by Zahir in 1758]]\n\nZahir consolidated his authority over Acre in a drawn-out process starting in the 1730s. His Acre-based partner, the [[Melkite]] merchant Yusuf al-Qassis, served as an early link between Zahir and the French merchants of Acre.<ref name=\"Philipp35\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA35 35].</ref> Zahir's first contact with the merchants came in 1731 when he arranged the settlement of debts owed to them by his brother Sa'd.<ref>Raymond, 1990, p. 135.</ref> In 1743,<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/> To stymie his cousin Muhammad ibn Ali's ambitions in Acre, Zahir had him arrested and executed.<ref name=\"Philipp35\"/> In 1743, Zahir requested the tax farm of Acre from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, who, wary of Zahir's growing power in the province, rejected the request. Instead, Zahir took Acre by force in July 1746.<ref name=\"Phillip36\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA36 36]</ref>\n\nIn the first few years following his takeover of Acre, Zahir resided in the fortress of Deir Hanna in the heart of Galilee. He began fortifying Acre by building walls around the city in 1750. He built other fortifications and buildings in Acre as well.<ref name=\"Phillip36\"/> In 1757 he took control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port villages of [[Haifa]] and [[Tantura]], and nearby [[Mount Carmel]], all of which had been part of Damascus Eyalet, unlike most of Zahir's domain at the time, which was in Sidon Eyalet.<ref name=\"Phillip36\"/><ref name=\"Phillip38\"/> He also captured the port village of [[Al-Tira, Haifa|al-Tira]], between Tantura and Haifa, at that time. Zahir's stated justification to the Ottoman authorities for conquering Palestine's northern coastal plain was to protect the area from [[Malta|Maltese]] pirates.<ref name=\"Joudah27\">Joudah, 1987, p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir maintained ties with,<ref name=\"Joudah41-2\">Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;41\u201342.</ref> launched an [[1757 Hajj caravan raid|assault on the Hajj caravan]] as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan [[Osman III]]'s sister. The attack shocked the [[Sublime Porte]] (Ottoman imperial government),<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 40.</ref> and discredited the governor of Damascus and ''[[amir al-hajj]]'', [[Husayn Pasha ibn Makki]], for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced [[As'ad Pasha al-Azm]], who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing [[Muhammad]] and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan [[Mustafa III]] (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.<ref name=\"Joudah41-2\"/>\n\nHusayn Pasha's replacement, [[Uthman Pasha al-Kurji]],<ref name=\"Phillip39\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA39 39]</ref> who took office in 1760,<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 143.</ref> sought to retrieve control of Haifa from Zahir.<ref name=\"Phillip39\"/> Uthman Pasha requested that the governor of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 48.</ref> The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over with the assistance of an Istanbul-based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high-ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders.<ref name=\"Phillip39\"/>\n\n===Intra-family conflict===\n[[File:DeirHanna076.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the fort at [[Deir Hanna]] that was built by Zahir's brother Sa'd. Zahir resided in Deir Hanna before moving to Acre]]\n\nIn 1761, Zahir ordered his son Uthman al-Zahir to assassinate Zahir's brother Sa'd because the latter had been collaborating with Uthman Pasha and the Bani Saqr tribe to kill Zahir and replace him.<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/><ref name=\"Joudah51\">Joudah, 1987, p. 51.</ref> Sa'd's assassination indirectly led to the first conflict between Zahir and his sons, in this case Uthman. The latter had been promised control over Shefa-'Amr in return for killing Sa'd, but Zahir reneged due to pleas by Shefa-'Amr's residents not to appoint Uthman as their governor. Backed by his full-brothers Ahmad and Sa'd al-Din, who were angered by Zahir's refusal to cede them more territory, Uthman besieged Shefa-'Amr in 1765. However, under Zahir's instructions, the locals in the vicinity defended the town and succeeded in preventing its capture. The three brothers then appealed to Zahir's eldest and most loyal son, Salibi, to intervene on their behalf with Zahir, but Salibi was unable to persuade Zahir to make concessions. The four brothers then attempted to rekindle their alliance with the Bani Saqr, who Zahir had since routed at the Marj Ibn Amer plain in 1762.<ref name=\"Joudah51\"/>\n\nThe brothers' efforts to recruit the Bani Saqr failed when Zahir bribed the tribe not to back his sons and subsequently had Uthman imprisoned in Haifa for six months before exiling him to a village near Safad.<ref name=\"Joudah52\">Joudah, 1987, p. 52.</ref> Meanwhile, in 1765, Zahir had Haifa demolished and then rebuilt and fortified at a site three kilometers to the southeast in 1769. While the old village was situated on a plain, the new town, which remained a port along the [[Haifa Bay]], was built on a narrow strip of land at the northern foot of Mount Carmel to make it easier to defend by land.<ref>Yazbak, 1998, p. 14.</ref> In May 1766, Uthman renewed his rebellion against Zahir with backing from the Druze clans of Galilee, but this coalition was defeated by Zahir near Safad. This conflict expanded to include competing Druze and Shia factions from Mount Lebanon and Jabal Amil, with Emir Mansur Shihab (the Sunni leader of a Druze faction) and the Metawali, Sheikh Qublan, siding with Zahir, while Emir [[Yusuf Shihab]] (the leader of another Druze faction) and Sheikh Nasif sided with Uthman.<ref name=\"Joudah52\"/> Mediation by Emir Isma'il Shihab of [[Hasbaya]] culminated in a successful peace summit near [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] between the two factions and a reconciliation between Zahir and Uthman, whereby the latter was granted control of Nazareth.<ref>Joudah, pp.&nbsp;52\u201353.</ref>\n\nIn September 1767, conflict between Zahir and his son Ali al-Zahir of Safad commenced over the former's refusal to cede to the latter control of the strategic fortress of Deir Hanna or the village of Deir al-Qassi. Prior to the dispute, Ali had been loyal to Zahir and proven himself effective in helping his father suppress dissent among his brothers and in battles against external enemies. Zahir's forces intimidated Ali into surrendering later that month, and Zahir pardoned and ultimately ceded to him Deir al-Qassi. However, conflict was renewed weeks later with Ali and his brother Sa'id, backed by Sheikh Nasif, Emir Yusuf and Uthman Pasha poised against Zahir, Uthman, Sheikh Qublan and [[Muhammad Pasha al-Azm]], governor of Sidon. With mediation from Ibrahim Sabbagh, Zahir's financial adviser, Zahir settled his dispute with Sa'id, granting the latter control over [[Tur'an]] and [[Hittin]].<ref name=\"Joudah54\">Joudah, 1987, p. 54.</ref>\n\nAli refused to negotiate, gained the backing of Salibi, and the two defeated their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre.<ref name=\"Joudah54\"/> When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 [[Kuru\u015f|piasters]] and 25 [[Arabian horse]]s for the fortress.<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/> By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were put to rest for several years (until 1774\u201375), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn 1768 the central Ottoman authorities partially recognized or legitimized Zahir's ''de facto'' political position by granting him the title of \"Sheikh of Acre, Emir of Nazareth, Tiberias, Safed, and Sheikh of all Galilee\".<ref name=\"EoI\"/> However, this official recognition was tempered when Yaqub Agha was executed shortly after and Sulayman Agha died in 1770, depriving Zahir of close allies in Istanbul. In November 1770, Uthman Pasha had the governor of Sidon replaced by his son [[Darwish Pasha al-Kurji|Darwish Pasha]] and had his other son, Muhammad Pasha, appointed governor of [[Tripoli Eyalet]]. Uthman Pasha was committed to ending Zahir's rule, and Zahir's position was left particularly vulnerable with the loss of support in Istanbul.<ref>Philipp, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA39 39]\u201340.</ref> In response to threats from Damascus, Zahir further strengthened Acre's fortifications and armed every adult male in the city with a rifle, two pistols and a [[sabre]]. He also moved to mend ties with his sons, who held various tax farms in Galilee, and consolidate his relationship with the Shia clans of Jabal Amil, thereby strengthening his local alliances.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA40  40]</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Ali Bey and war with Damascus===\nAlthough Zahir was bereft of friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new alliance with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the [[Hejaz]], [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]]. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to [[Syria (region)|Syria]] for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Jaffa]] under commander [[Ismail Bey]].<ref name=\"Phillip41\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA41 41]</ref> Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made it as far as [[Muzayrib]], but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.<ref name=\"Rogan50\">Rogan, 2009, p.

In a unilateral move to impose his authority in Uthman Pasha's jurisdiction, Zahir had his son Ahmad and other subordinate commanders collect taxes from villages in Damascus Eyalet, including [[Quneitra]], while he dispatched his other son Ali on a campaign against the Bani Nu'aym tribe in [[Hauran]], also part of Damascus.<ref name=\"Joudah70\">Joudah, 1987, p. 70.</ref> In response to Zahir's indignation, Ali Bey sent him 35,000 troops under [[Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab|Abu al-Dhahab]] in May.<ref name=\"Phillip41\"/> Together with Ismail's troops in Jaffa,<ref name=\"Rogan50\"/> the Egyptian army captured Damascus from Uthman Pasha in June, while Zahir and his Metawali allies captured the city of [[Sidon]] from Darwish Pasha.

By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful [[Jarrar clan]],<ref name=\"Doumani96\">Doumani, 1995, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zry-tpH3rz8C&pg=PA96 96]</ref> who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the ''miri'' (''hajj'' pilgrimage tax).<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 88.</ref> Nablus was under the ''de facto'' control of the [[Tuqan clan|Tuqan]] and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated.<ref name=\"Doumani96\"/>\n\nUthman Pasha had resumed his governorship of Damascus at the end of June 1771 and was determined to eliminate Zahir. To that end, he assembled a coalition that included his sons Darwish Pasha al-Kurji and Muhammad Pasha al-Kurji, who were the governors of Sidon and Tripoli, respectively, and Emir Yusuf Shihab of Mount Lebanon. In late August Uthman Pasha reached [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]] at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops.<ref name=\"Joudah84\"/> Before Uthman Pasha could be joined by his allies, Zahir and Sheikh Nasif of the Metawalis confronted the governor's troops on 2 September. Ali al-Zahir, Zahir's son and a commander of one of his four battlefield regiments, raided Uthman Pasha's camp, while Zahir's other troops blocked them from the west. Uthman Pasha's troops hastily retreated towards the [[Jordan River]], the only place where they were not surrounded. The overwhelming majority drowned in the river, with only 300\u2013500 survivors, including Uthman Pasha who almost drowned but was rescued by one of his men.<ref name=\"Joudah85\">Joudah, 1987, p. 85.</ref> The [[Battle of Lake Huleh (1771)|Battle of Lake Hula]] marked a decisive victory for Zahir, who entered Acre triumphantly with the spoils of Uthman Pasha's camp. He was celebrated by the residents of the city and on the way there, he was given honorary [[gun salute]]s by each of his fortified villages on the route between Tiberias and Acre. He also received congratulations from the French merchant ships at the port of Acre. Zahir's victory encouraged Ali Bey to relaunch his Syrian campaign.<ref name=\"Joudah85\"/>\n\nFollowing his victory against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, which he did on 13 October. He returned two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at [[Nabatieh]] on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, only to have the pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of [[Deir al-Qamar]], while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 86</ref> Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.<ref name=\"Phillip42\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA42 42].</ref>\n\nMuhammad Tuqan captured Jaffa from Zahir in May 1772, the same month that Ali Bey arrived in Acre to seek Zahir's protection after being forced out of Egypt by rival mamluks. In June, the Ottoman loyalist [[Jazzar Pasha]] sought to establish himself in [[Lebanon]] and took over [[Beirut]] from the local Druze chieftains. The Druze had previously been in conflict with Zahir, but due to Jazzar's offensive, the circumstances fostered an alliance between them, Zahir and the Metawali clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir and Ali Bey sought to take back Jaffa and, with help from the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Fleet]], succeeded after a nine-month siege, in which they exhausted many of their resources. Prior to that, in late October 1772, Zahir and his Lebanese allies captured Beirut from Jazzar, also with Russian naval support.<ref name=\"Phillip42\"/>\n\nIn March 1773, Ali Bey left Palestine to reestablish himself in Egypt, but Abu al-Dhahab had him killed when he arrived there.<ref name=\"Phillip42\"/> With this came an end to the alliance between Zahir and Ali Bey, which had brought together Egypt and Palestine politically and economically in a way that had not occurred since the early 16th century.<ref>D.

All of [[Ottoman Syria]] came under the official command of Uthman Pasha al-Misri in 1774 in order to bring stability to the provinces of the region. Al-Misri did not seek conflict with Zahir and sought to establish friendly terms with him. As such, he convinced the Sublime Porte to officially appoint Zahir as the governor of Sidon as long as Zahir paid all of the taxes the province had owed to the Porte. Al-Misri further promoted Zahir in February by declaring him \"Governor of Sidon, Nablus, Gaza, [[Ramla]], Jaffa and [[Ajlun|Jabal Ajlun]]\", although this title was not officially sanctioned by the Porte.<ref name=\"Phillip42\"/> In effect, Zahir was the ''de facto'' ruler over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (with the exception of Nablus and Jerusalem), Jabal Amil, and the [[Syria (region)|Syria]]n coast from Gaza to Beirut.<ref>Philipp, 2001, pp.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA42  42]\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Downfall and death===\n[[File:Zahir al-Umar maximum extent map.svg|thumb|right|Zahir al-Umar's autonomous sheikhdom in 1774]]\n\nAl-Misri was recalled to Istanbul in the summer of 1774 and [[Muhammad Pasha al-Azm]] was appointed governor of Damascus. Thus, Zahir's governorship of Sidon was left vulnerable because it had largely depended on guarantees from al-Misri. Al-Azm sought peaceful relations with Zahir, but the Sublime Porte, having made [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|peace]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and relieving itself from that [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|conflict]], aimed to undermine the rebellious rulers of its provinces, including Zahir. Al-Azm managed to secure an official [[pardon]] of Zahir from the Porte in April 1775, but not the governorship of Sidon. Meanwhile, conflict between Zahir and his sons had reignited, with Ali of Safad attempting to capture Zahir's villages in Galilee in 1774. Zahir defeated Ali with support from his other son, Ahmad of Tiberias. Afterward, Zahir's rule was again challenged by one of his other sons, Sa'id,<ref name=\"Phillip43\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA43 43].</ref> later that year. In response to this challenge, Zahir armed and mobilized 300 of Acre's civilian inhabitants to counter Sa'id.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA137 137]</ref> Ali continued to undermine Zahir's rule by encouraging defections by Zahir's Maghrebi mercenaries through bribes.<ref name=\"Phillip43\"/>\n\nOn 20 May 1775, Abu al-Dhahab, having been encouraged by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al-Ifranj (the French [[Caravanserai]]) for safekeeping. On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon.<ref name=\"Joudah112\">Joudah, 1987, p. 112.</ref> Ali al-Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al-Dhahab's troops approached it a few days later.<ref name=\"Phillip43\"/> They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil.<ref name=\"Joudah112\"/> Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al-Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re-entered the city two days later and reestablished order with the assistance of Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA44 44].</ref> However, the setback of Abu al-Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands.<ref name=\"Joudah114\">Joudah, 1987, p. 114.</ref>\n\nOn 23 April, the Porte dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] [[Kapudan Pasha|admiral]], [[Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha|Hasan Pasha al-Jazayiri]], to blockade Acre. He reached Haifa on 7 August taking Jaffa from Zahir's son-in-law, Karim al-Ayyubi.<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/> Hasan Pasha ordered Zahir to pay the ''miri'' dues he owed to the Sublime Porte dating back to 1768. Zahir initially agreed to pay 500,000 piasters of the total amount upfront and a further 50,000 piasters to Hasan Pasha himself to \"spare the blood of the people\".<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/> Hasan Pasha apparently accepted Zahir's proposals, but the arrangements fell apart.<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/>\n\nThe accounts differ as to exactly how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure was the result of disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli.<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/> Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the ''miri'' dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the ''miri'' dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.<ref name=\"Joudah115\">Joudah, 1987, p. 115.</ref>\n\nHasan proceeded to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning fire from the city's artillerymen;<ref name=\"Joudah115\"/> al-Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces to refrain from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, Zahir attempted to flee Acre on 21 or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.<ref name=\"Joudah116\">Joudah, 1987, p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nFollowing his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih were arrested by Hasan Pasha's men.<ref name=\"Joudah117\">Joudah, 1987, p. 117.</ref> The Sublime Porte also seized property belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital along with their physician, who was known to be talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha.<ref>Thackston, 1988, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ISHHYMNmp0gC&pg=PA17 17]\u201318.</ref> Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of [[Gaza Sanjak|Gaza]], but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.<ref name=\"Joudah116\"/>\n\nZahir's sons Uthman, Ahmad, Sa'id and Ali continued to put up resistance, with the latter putting up the longest fight from his fortress in Deir Hanna. The fortress eventually capitulated to the combined forces of Hasan Pasha and Jazzar Pasha on 22 July 1776. Ali fled, but was killed later that year in the area between Tiberias and Safad. By then, the rest of Zahir's sons had been arrested or killed. Abbas was later appointed by Sultan [[Selim III]] as the Sheikh of Safad. However, in 1799, when [[Napoleon]] invaded Palestine, but withdrew after being [[Siege of Acre (1799)|defeated in Acre]], Abbas and Salih both left Safad with the departing French forces. This marked the end of Zaydani influence in Galilee.<ref name=\"Joudah117\"/>\n\n[[Constantin-Fran\u00e7ois Chasseb\u0153uf|Constantin-Fran\u00e7ois Volney]], who wrote the first European biography of Zahir in 1787,<ref>Volney, 1788, p.

Secondly, the early concessions he made to his children. Third, and most of all, the avarice of his adviser and confidant, Ibrahim Sabbagh.<ref>Volney, 1788, p.

Except for Acre and Haifa, Zahir divided the remainder of his territory between his relatives. His eldest brother was appointed to Deir Hanna, and his younger brothers Yusuf and Salih Abu Dani were installed in [[I'billin]] and Arraba, respectively.<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> Zahir appointed his eldest son Salibi as the ''multazim'' of Tiberias.<ref name=\"Phillip153\"/> Salibi was killed in 1773 fighting alongside Ali Bey's forces in Egypt.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 110.</ref> His death deeply distressed Zahir, who was around 80 years old at the time.<ref>Sabbagh, 2006, p.

Ahmad replaced Salibi in Tiberias as well, and also conquered Ajlun and [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. In addition, Ahmad was given authority over Deir Hanna after Sa'd's death. Zahir appointed his nephew Ayyub al-Karimi in Jaffa and Gaza,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> while al-Dinkizli was made ''multazim'' in Sidon in 1774. The appointment of Zahir's relatives and close associates was meant to ensure the efficient administration of his expanding realm and the loyalty of his circle. Among their chief functions was to ensure the supply of cotton to Acre. It is not clear if these posts were recognized by the Ottoman government.<ref name=\"Phillip153\"/>\n\nZahir had an aide who jointly served in the capacity of ''mudabbir'' (manager) and ''wazir'' ([[vizier]]) to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence.<ref name=\"Joudah39\">Joudah, 1987, p. 39.</ref> This official had always been a Melkite (local Greek Catholic). His first ''wazir'' was Yusuf al-Arqash,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to [[Malta]].<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local [[Greek Orthodox Christian]] and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite.<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir largely because of the wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in [[Damietta]], Egypt.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 126.</ref> Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's political adviser, main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials.<ref name=\"Joudah128\">Joudah, 1987, p. 128.</ref>\n\nThere were other officials in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the ''[[mufti]]'' and the ''[[qadi]]''. The mufti was the chief scholar among the ''[[ulama]]'' (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of [[Islamic law]] in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same ''mufti'' for many years at a time in contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its ''mufti'' replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the ''qadi'' from Palestine's local ''ulama'', but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the ''qadi'' of Sidon.<ref name=\"Joudah128\"/> Zahir had a chief [[imam]], who in the last years of his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi.<ref>Reichmuth, 2009, pp.&nbsp;45\u201346.</ref> An ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'' was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.<ref name=\"Joudah128\"/>\n\nZahir's initial military forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen and the local inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The core of his private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of the remainder of his rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from [[Venice]] or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 129.</ref>\n\n===General security===\n[[File:Yehiam-fortress-1879.jpg|thumb|right|Zahir rebuilt the Crusader-era [[Yehi'am Fortress National Park|fortress]] at [[Khirbat Jiddin]] ]]\n\nAccording to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, the two principal conditions Zahir established to foster his sheikhdom's prosperity and its survival were \"security and justice\".<ref name=\"Joudah37\">Joudah, 1987, p. 37.</ref> Prior to Zahir's consolidation of power, the villages of northern Palestine were prone to Bedouin raids and robberies and the roads were under constant threat from highway robbers and Bedouin attacks. Although following the looting raids, the inhabitants of these agrarian villages were left destitute, the Ottoman provincial government would nonetheless attempt to collect from them the ''miri'' (hajj tax). To avoid punitive measures for not paying the ''miri'', the inhabitants would abandon their villages for safety in the larger towns or the desert. This situation hurt the economy of the region as the raids sharply reduced the villages' agricultural output, the government-appointed ''[[mutasallim]]s'' ([[tax farm]]ers) could not collect their impositions, and trade could not be safely conducted due to insecurity on the roads.<ref name=\"Joudah37\"/>\n\nBy 1746, however, Zahir had established order in the lands he ruled.<ref>Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;37\u201338.</ref> He managed to co-opt the dominant Bedouin tribe of the region, the Bani Saqr, which greatly contributed to the establishment of security in northern Palestine.<ref>Philipp, 1992, p.

General security reached a level whereby \"an old woman with gold in her hand could travel from one place to another without fear or danger\", according to biographer Mikhail Sabbagh.<ref name=\"Joudah38\">Joudah, 1987, p. 38.</ref>\n\nThis period of calm that persisted between 1744 and 1765 greatly boosted the security and economy of Galilee. The security established in the region encouraged people from other parts of the Ottoman Empire to immigrate to Galilee.<ref name=\"Phillip38\"/> Conflict between the local clans and between Zahir and his sons remained limited to periodic clashes, while there were no attacks against Zahir's domain from outside forces.<ref name=\"Phillip39\"/> While Zahir used force to strengthen his position in the region, the local inhabitants generally took comfort in his rule, which historian Thomas Philip described as \"relatively just and reasonably fair\".<ref name=\"Philip32\"/> According to [[Richard Pococke]] who visited the area in 1737, the local people had great admiration for Zahir, especially for his war against bandits on the roads.<ref>[[Richard Pococke|Pococke]], 1745, vol 2, p.

These benefits included loans to peasants and the distribution of free seeds.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/> Financial burdens on the peasants were also reduced as Zahir offered tax relief during drought seasons or when the harvest seasons were poor.<ref name=\"Phillip38\"/><ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 123.</ref> This same tax relief was extended to newcomers who sought to begin cultivating new farmlands.<ref name=\"Phillip38\"/> Moreover, Zahir assumed responsibility for outstanding payments the peasants owed to merchants from credit-based transactions if the merchants could provide proof of unsatisfactory payment.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/> According to historian Thomas Philipp, Zahir \"had the good business sense not to exploit peasants to the point of destruction, but kept his financial demands to a more moderate level.\"<ref name=\"Phillip38\">Philipp, 2001, p.

This allowed him to both monopolize cotton production and the merchants' price for the product.<ref>Doumani, 1995, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zry-tpH3rz8C&pg=PA98 98].</ref> Zahir's designation of prices for the local [[cash crop]]s also prevented \"exploitation\" of the peasants and local merchants by European merchants and their \"manipulation of the prices\", according to Joudah.<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> This caused financial losses to the European merchants who lodged numerous complaints to the French and English ambassadors to the Sublime Porte. A formal agreement to regulate commerce between Zahir and the European merchants was reached in 1753.<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> Zahir further encouraged trade by offering local merchants interest-free loans.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/>\n\nThe high European demand for the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his autonomous sheikhdom.

His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance in the construction of Jewish homes, schools and [[synagogue]]s, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area.<ref>Barnay, 1992, p.

In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the [[Maronites|Maronite]] and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively.<ref name=\"Emmett22\">Emmett, 1995, p.

R. Khoury: \"Political Relations Between City and State in the Middle East 1700\u20131850\", in Sluglett, 2008, p.

He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation|St. Gabriel's Church]] over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth,<ref name=\"Emmett22\"/> and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest church in the city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As a testament to the prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built under the auspices of Zahir's less tolerant successors.<ref name=\"Phillip177\"/>\n\nA strong relationship existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs and merchant class. Zahir maintained law and order in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skills.<ref name=\"Shanahan23\"/> Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their successful conflict with the Druze [[Jumblatt family|Jumblatt clan]] and the Shihab clan under Mulhim Shihab,<ref>Winter, 2010, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGeuAeFFJCEC&pg=PA132 132]</ref> <ref name=\"Shanahan23\"/>.\n\nThe relationship between Zahir and the rural sheikhs of the Druze of Mount Lebanon under the Shihab dynasty were mixed. While Sheikh Mansur Shihab of [[Chouf]] allied himself with Zahir, his nephew and rival, Yusuf Shihab of the [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] region remained supportive of the Ottomans.<ref>Harris, 2012, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&pg=PA120 120]</ref> Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze ''emirs'' of Mount Lebanon, he Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. In the oral traditions of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression. During this period, many Druze villages were either destroyed or abandoned and there was a partial Druze exodus from Galilee, particularly from the villages around Safad, to the Hauran region east of the Jordan River.<ref>Firro, 1992, p.

The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network of marriages between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan.<ref>Ajami, 1986, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZsMhk6BM68C&pg=PA54 54].</ref> Zahir's own marriages were politically advantageous as they allowed him to consecrate his rule over certain areas or his relationships with certain Bedouin tribes, local clans or urban notables.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/> Zahir had five wives during his lifetime.<ref name=\"Smollet1783\">Smollet, 1783, p.

Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775.<ref name=\"Joudah55\">Joudah, 1987, p. 55.</ref> Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power.<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 16791 Archeological sites of Israel.JPG|thumb|right|The fortress of [[Shefa-'Amr]], built by Zahir's son Uthman]]\n\nZahir's rule radically changed the landscape of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre and the establishment of the secondary port city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]].<ref name=\"Orser473\">Orser, 1996, p.

The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.<ref>Orser, 1996, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6S7hRdinkPEC&pg=PA474 474]</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s [[Claude Reignier Conder]] wrote that the Ottomans had successfully destroyed the power of Palestine's indigenous ruling families who \"had practically been their own masters\" but had been \"ruined so that there is no longer any spirit left in them\".<ref name=\"Scholch474\">Scholch, 1984, p.

In particular the Palestinians consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian society that has elevated Zahir and his legacy to near-iconic status. These re-readings are not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the ongoing consequences of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]]. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a \"little Kingdom,\" as [[Albert Hourani]] called it, in most of Palestine for over a quarter of a century.<ref name=\"Joudah2nded\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Building works===\n[[File:Saraya Building Nazareth 022.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Seraya]] of [[Nazareth]], built by Zahir]]\n\nZahir and his family built fortresses, watchtowers, warehouses, and ''khans'' (caravanserais).

Bosworth, \"\u1e92\u0101hir al- \u02bfUmar al-Zayd\u0101n\u012b\".</ref> while the area was still nominally part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. For much of his reign, starting in the 1730s, his domain mainly consisted of [[Galilee]], with successive headquarters in [[Tiberias]], [[Arraba, Galilee|Arraba]], [[Nazareth]], [[Deir Hanna]] and finally [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], in 1746. He fortified Acre, and the city became a center of the cotton trade between Palestine and Europe. In the mid-1760s, he reestablished the port town of [[Haifa]] nearby.\n\nZahir successfully withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman governors of the [[Sidon Eyalet|Sidon]] and [[Damascus Eyalet|Damascus]] provinces, who attempted to limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural [[Shia Muslim]] clans of [[Jabal Amil]]. In 1771, in alliance with [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]] of the [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]] and with backing from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Zahir captured [[Sidon]], while Ali Bey's forces conquered [[Damascus]], both acts in open defiance of the [[Ottoman sultan]]. At the peak of his power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous [[sheikhdom]] extended from [[Beirut]] to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and included the Jabal Amil and [[Ajlun|Jabal Ajlun]] regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the [[Sublime Porte]] felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The [[Ottoman Navy]] attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.\n\nThe wealth Zahir accumulated through monopolizing Palestine's cotton and olive oil trade to Europe financed his sheikhdom. For much of his rule, he oversaw a relatively efficient administration and maintained domestic security, although he faced and suppressed several rebellions by his sons. The aforementioned factors, along with Zahir's flexible taxation policies and his battlefield reputation made him popular among the local [[fellah|peasantry]]. Zahir's tolerance of religious minorities encouraged [[Arab Christian|Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish immigration to his domain. The influx of immigrants from other parts of the empire stimulated the local economy and led to the significant growth of the Christian communities in Acre and Nazareth and the Jewish community in Tiberias. He and his family, the [[Al-Zayadina|Zaydani clan]], also patronized the construction of commercial buildings, houses of worship and fortifications throughout Galilee. Zahir's founding of a virtually autonomous state in Palestine has made him a national hero among [[Palestinians]] today.<ref name=\"Joudah2nded\">{{cite journal|last1=Joudah|first1=Ahmad|title=Zahir al-'Umar and the First Autonomous Regime in Ottoman Palestine (1744-1775)|journal=Jerusalem Quarterly|date=2015|issue=63\u201364|pages=84\u201385|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/JQ%2063_Zahir%20al-Umar.pdf|publisher=Institute for Palestine Studies}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Daher arrabe2.jpg|thumb|upright|Zahir's home in [[Arraba, Galilee|Arraba]]]]\n\nZahir was born in the village of [[Arraba, Galilee|'Arrabat al-Battuf]] in central [[Galilee]].<ref name=\"Pappe35\"/><ref>Philipp, 2001, p. 30.</ref> His date of birth is not definitively known, with the years 1686, 1689/90 and 1694 cited by Zahir's contemporary biographers [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney|Volney]], Mikha'il Sabbagh and [[Khalil al-Muradi]], respectively. According to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, 1689/1690 is the most likely year of his birth because he considers Sabbagh to be the most reliable source for Zahir's personal life.<ref name=\"Joudah29\">Joudah, 1987, p. 29.</ref> The proper transliteration of his given name is ''\u1e92\u0101hir'', but in the local dialect of Arabic used in Galilee, his name was pronounced ''\u1e0c\u0101hir''.<ref name=\"Joudah29\"/> Zahir's family, the [[al-Zayadina|Zaydani clan]], were [[Sunni Muslim]]<ref name=\"Harris114\">Harris, 2012, p.

Zahir was the youngest of four sons born to Sheikh [[Umar al-Zaydani]];<ref name=\"Pappe35\">Pappe, 2010, p. 35.</ref> his brothers were Sa'd, Salih \"Abu Dani\" and Yusuf, and his sister was Shammah.<ref name=Joudah139/> Zahir grew up in the village of [[Saffuriya]].<ref name=\"Pappe35\"/>\n\nZahir's father and grandfather had both served as the ''[[multazim]]'' (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the [[Druze]] [[emir]]s (princes) of the [[Maan family|Ma'an dynasty]] which governed the region from their headquarters in [[Mount Lebanon]].<ref name=\"Philip31\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA31 31]</ref> In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed ''multazim'' of the [[Safad]] region by [[Shihab dynasty#Regency of Bashir I|Bashir Shihab I]], the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the [[Mount Lebanon Emirate]].<ref name=\"Moammar43-44\">Moammar, 1990, pp.&nbsp;43\u201344.</ref> The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to [[Aleppo]] and controlled [[iltizam|tax farms]] in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of [[al-Damun]]. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became the head of the family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that in the event of a default in tax payments, the Ottoman government would not be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.<ref name=\"Philip31\"/>\n\nIn 1707, Zahir was involved in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a man. As a result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of [[Bi'ina]] was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of [[Sidon Eyalet]] sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir played an important role in defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local [[fellahin|peasantry]] throughout the 1720s.\n\nAlong with Sa'd, he also gained prestige among the people of [[Damascus]], with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father.<ref name=\"Philip31\"/> Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghaffar al-Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al-Husayni family, which provided the ''[[sharif]]s'' of Damascus at the time;<ref name=\"Philip31\"/> Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to [[Nazareth]] because she considered Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">Philipp, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA31 31]\u201332.</ref>\n\n==Rule==\n===Consolidation of power in Galilee===\n[[File:Tiberias-S-781.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the citadel at Tiberias which Zahir built early in his rule]]\n\nIn the late 1720s, Zahir and his brother Yusuf, backed by the Bani Saqr, captured Tiberias and its ''multazim''. Concurrently, Zahir issued a letter to [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Abdullah Pasha]], governor of Sidon Eyalet, accusing the ''multazim'' of oppression and of imposing illegal taxes on the population. Zahir insisted that if Abdullah Pasha appointed him ''multazim'' of Tiberias and Arraba, he would guarantee the timely payment of taxes and rule justly. Abdullah Pasha consented to Zahir's rule and sent him an honorary robe.<ref name=\"Joudah2223\">Joudah, 1987, pp. 22-23</ref> This was the first time a Zaydani ''multazim'' was directly appointed by the governor of Sidon rather than the semi-autonomous rural chiefs of Mount Lebanon.<ref name=\"Philip32\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA32 32]</ref> Zahir made Tiberias his principal base and was joined by his Zaydani kinsmen.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA33  33]</ref>\n\nZahir extended his rule southward toward Nazareth and the [[Jezreel Valley|Marj Ibn Amer]] plain (Jezreel Valley) between Galilee and [[Jabal Nablus]].<ref name=\"Pappe35\"/> Capturing these areas was a drawn-out process, and Zahir's efforts to take Nazareth (a town in [[Safad Sanjak]], but controlled by the [[Jarrar clan]] based in [[Nablus Sanjak]]) caused the ruling clans of the [[Samaria|Nablus hinterland]] (Jabal Nablus), along with Zahir's erstwhile allies in the Bani Saqr tribe, to challenge him. Zahir, meanwhile, relied on his Zaydani kinsmen, [[Maghreb]]i mercenaries whom he commissioned in the mid-1730s under commander Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, and Nazareth's residents.<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> In 1735, Zahir's 2,000-strong force routed the Jarrars and the Bani Saqr at al-Rawha in Marj Ibn Amer,<ref name=\"Joudah28\">Joudah, 1987, p. 28.</ref> killed their leader Sheikh Ibrahim al-Jarrar, and captured Nazareth.<ref>Doumani, 1995, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zry-tpH3rz8C&pg=PA41 41]\u201342.</ref> According to historian Hanna Samarah, Zahir's forces inflicted 8,000 fatalities among the Jarrar-Saqr coalition during the battle.<ref name=\"Joudah31\">Joudah, 1987, p. 31.</ref>\n\nFollowing his victory at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, including many residents of Nazareth,<ref name=\"Joudah28\"/> joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops with food and water.<ref name=\"Joudah31\"/> Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their [[throne village]] of [[Sanur, Jenin|Sanur]], but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the [[Tuqan clan|Tuqans]].<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA34 34]</ref>\n\nIn 1738, Zahir's forces captured the [[Yehi'am Fortress National Park|fortress]] at [[Khirbat Jiddin|Jiddin]] and the villages in its political orbit, [[Abu Snan]] and [[Tarshiha]].<ref name=\"Philip32\"/> Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule complained that he governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed ''multazim'' of Jiddin's subdistrict.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 23.</ref>\n\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 11832 al omari mosque in tiberias.jpg|thumb|right|The Omari Mosque in Tiberias, built by Zahir]]\n\nBi'ina, which was also fortified, withstood a siege by Zahir in 1739, but Zahir later married the daughter of Bi'ina's ''[[mukhtar]]'' (headman), and thus brought Bi'ina into his domain.<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> He also acquired the fortress of [[Suhmata]] through diplomatic means,<ref name=\"Joudah24\">Joudah, 1987, p. 24.</ref> further solidifying his rule over northern and eastern Galilee. In 1740, Zahir made an agreement with the neighboring Bedouin tribes to end their looting raids in the area. By then, Sa'd had taken control of [[Deir Hanna]] and Muhammad ibn Ali captured [[Shefa-'Amr]], entrenching the presence of the Zaydani clan in western Galilee.<ref name=\"Philip33\"/> After negotiations, Muhammad al-Naf'i, the ''multazim'' of Safad, surrendered the city to Zahir.<ref name=\"Philip32\"/> Safad was the administrative seat of the ''sanjak'' and situated on a strategic hill overlooking the Galilee countryside.<ref>Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;23\u201324.</ref> Zahir later acquired the fortified village of [[Dayr al-Qassi|Deir al-Qassi]] after marrying the daughter of its sheikh, Abd al-Khaliq Salih.<ref name=\"Joudah24\"/>\n\nZahir's conquest of the Safad region and western Galilee removed the barriers between him and the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Metawali]] (Shia Muslim) clans of [[Jabal Amil]]. Zahir informed the Metawalis' sheikh, [[Nasif al-Nassar]], of his intent to acquire the fortified villages of [[al-Bassa]] and [[Yaroun]] on the borders between the Zaydani and Metawali sheikhdoms. In response, Sheikh Nasif launched an assault against Zahir and the two sides confronted each other in indecisive skirmishes in the border village of [[Tarbikha]]. Zahir then received reinforcements from his Maghrebi cavalry and defeated the Metawalis, pursuing Sheikh Nasif to his headquarters in [[Tibnin]]. Zahir's brother Sa'd mediated an end to the fighting and secured a mutual defense pact between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif, whereby the former would receive control of al-Bassa and Yaroun and the Metawalis' support in his confrontations with the governors of Damascus; in return, Sheikh Nasif's sons, who were captured by Zahir's troops, were released, the Metawalis' tax payments to Sidon were reduced by some 25 percent, and Zahir guaranteed his backing of Sheikh Nasif in any confrontation with the governors of Sidon.<ref>Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;26\u201327.</ref>\n\nZahir, similar to other local strongmen in the Ottoman Empire who did not owe their power to the central Ottoman authorities, was disliked by the Ottoman administration. The [[Ottoman Sultan]] sent an order to the governor of [[Damascus Eyalet]], [[Sulayman Pasha al-Azm]], to put an end to Zahir's rule in Galilee. In September 1742, a military force led by the governor of Damascus came to Galilee and laid siege to Tiberias. After 83 days, the siege was lifted due to the departure of the [[Hajj]] pilgrim caravan.<ref>Moammar, 1990, pp.&nbsp;71\u201382.</ref> Using this respite, Zahir reinforced the defenses of Tiberias and Shefa-'Amr. In July 1743, backed by the Bani Saqr, the ''wali'' of Tripoli and the district governors of Jerusalem, Gaza and [[Irbid]], Sulayman Pasha renewed his expedition, this time seeking to reduce Deir Hanna and sever Tiberias's links to the outside. Sulayman died suddenly in [[Lubya]] and Zahir used the opportunity to assault Sulayman's troops, capturing their camp.<ref name=\"Joudah\">Joudah, 1987, p. 37</ref> In 1745, Zahir had a fortress erected on a hill overlooking [[Saffuriya]].<ref>Khalidi, 1992, p. 351.</ref>\n\n===Ruler of Acre===\n[[File:Dar el omar camisi 042 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[al-Muallaq Mosque]] built by Zahir in 1758]]\n\nZahir consolidated his authority over Acre in a drawn-out process starting in the 1730s. His Acre-based partner, the [[Melkite]] merchant Yusuf al-Qassis, served as an early link between Zahir and the French merchants of Acre.<ref name=\"Philipp35\">Philipp, 2001, p.

Instead, Zahir took Acre by force in July 1746.<ref name=\"Phillip36\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA36 36]</ref>\n\nIn the first few years following his takeover of Acre, Zahir resided in the fortress of Deir Hanna in the heart of Galilee. He began fortifying Acre by building walls around the city in 1750. He built other fortifications and buildings in Acre as well.<ref name=\"Phillip36\"/> In 1757 he took control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port villages of [[Haifa]] and [[Tantura]], and nearby [[Mount Carmel]], all of which had been part of Damascus Eyalet, unlike most of Zahir's domain at the time, which was in Sidon Eyalet.<ref name=\"Phillip36\"/><ref name=\"Phillip38\"/> He also captured the port village of [[Al-Tira, Haifa|al-Tira]], between Tantura and Haifa, at that time. Zahir's stated justification to the Ottoman authorities for conquering Palestine's northern coastal plain was to protect the area from [[Malta|Maltese]] pirates.<ref name=\"Joudah27\">Joudah, 1987, p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir maintained ties with,<ref name=\"Joudah41-2\">Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;41\u201342.</ref> launched an [[1757 Hajj caravan raid|assault on the Hajj caravan]] as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan [[Osman III]]'s sister. The attack shocked the [[Sublime Porte]] (Ottoman imperial government),<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 40.</ref> and discredited the governor of Damascus and ''[[amir al-hajj]]'', [[Husayn Pasha ibn Makki]], for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced [[As'ad Pasha al-Azm]], who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the caravan from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing [[Muhammad]] and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan [[Mustafa III]] (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.<ref name=\"Joudah41-2\"/>\n\nHusayn Pasha's replacement, [[Uthman Pasha al-Kurji]],<ref name=\"Phillip39\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA39 39]</ref> who took office in 1760,<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 143.</ref> sought to retrieve control of Haifa from Zahir.<ref name=\"Phillip39\"/> Uthman Pasha requested that the governor of Sidon, Nu'man Pasha, recapture the port city on his behalf, to which Nu'man Pasha complied, dispatching 30 Maghrebi soldiers on a vessel captained by a Frenchman on 20 May 1761.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 48.</ref> The effort was a meager attempt and upon arrival, Zahir had the ship confiscated and its soldiers arrested, while the French captain paid a fine. The issue over Haifa's annexation was smoothed over with the assistance of an Istanbul-based Ottoman official and friend of Zahir, Yaqub Agha. Yaqub had a high-ranking official named Sulayman Agha intervene in the matter and revoke Uthman Pasha's orders.<ref name=\"Phillip39\"/>\n\n===Intra-family conflict===\n[[File:DeirHanna076.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of the fort at [[Deir Hanna]] that was built by Zahir's brother Sa'd. Zahir resided in Deir Hanna before moving to Acre]]\n\nIn 1761, Zahir ordered his son Uthman al-Zahir to assassinate Zahir's brother Sa'd because the latter had been collaborating with Uthman Pasha and the Bani Saqr tribe to kill Zahir and replace him.<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/><ref name=\"Joudah51\">Joudah, 1987, p. 51.</ref> Sa'd's assassination indirectly led to the first conflict between Zahir and his sons, in this case Uthman. The latter had been promised control over Shefa-'Amr in return for killing Sa'd, but Zahir reneged due to pleas by Shefa-'Amr's residents not to appoint Uthman as their governor. Backed by his full-brothers Ahmad and Sa'd al-Din, who were angered by Zahir's refusal to cede them more territory, Uthman besieged Shefa-'Amr in 1765. However, under Zahir's instructions, the locals in the vicinity defended the town and succeeded in preventing its capture. The three brothers then appealed to Zahir's eldest and most loyal son, Salibi, to intervene on their behalf with Zahir, but Salibi was unable to persuade Zahir to make concessions. The four brothers then attempted to rekindle their alliance with the Bani Saqr, who Zahir had since routed at the Marj Ibn Amer plain in 1762.<ref name=\"Joudah51\"/>\n\nThe brothers' efforts to recruit the Bani Saqr failed when Zahir bribed the tribe not to back his sons and subsequently had Uthman imprisoned in Haifa for six months before exiling him to a village near Safad.<ref name=\"Joudah52\">Joudah, 1987, p. 52.</ref> Meanwhile, in 1765, Zahir had Haifa demolished and then rebuilt and fortified at a site three kilometers to the southeast in 1769. While the old village was situated on a plain, the new town, which remained a port along the [[Haifa Bay]], was built on a narrow strip of land at the northern foot of Mount Carmel to make it easier to defend by land.<ref>Yazbak, 1998, p. 14.</ref> In May 1766, Uthman renewed his rebellion against Zahir with backing from the Druze clans of Galilee, but this coalition was defeated by Zahir near Safad. This conflict expanded to include competing Druze and Shia factions from Mount Lebanon and Jabal Amil, with Emir Mansur Shihab (the Sunni leader of a Druze faction) and the Metawali, Sheikh Qublan, siding with Zahir, while Emir [[Yusuf Shihab]] (the leader of another Druze faction) and Sheikh Nasif sided with Uthman.<ref name=\"Joudah52\"/> Mediation by Emir Isma'il Shihab of [[Hasbaya]] culminated in a successful peace summit near [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] between the two factions and a reconciliation between Zahir and Uthman, whereby the latter was granted control of Nazareth.<ref>Joudah, pp.&nbsp;52\u201353.</ref>\n\nIn September 1767, conflict between Zahir and his son Ali al-Zahir of Safad commenced over the former's refusal to cede to the latter control of the strategic fortress of Deir Hanna or the village of Deir al-Qassi. Prior to the dispute, Ali had been loyal to Zahir and proven himself effective in helping his father suppress dissent among his brothers and in battles against external enemies. Zahir's forces intimidated Ali into surrendering later that month, and Zahir pardoned and ultimately ceded to him Deir al-Qassi. However, conflict was renewed weeks later with Ali and his brother Sa'id, backed by Sheikh Nasif, Emir Yusuf and Uthman Pasha poised against Zahir, Uthman, Sheikh Qublan and [[Muhammad Pasha al-Azm]], governor of Sidon. With mediation from Ibrahim Sabbagh, Zahir's financial adviser, Zahir settled his dispute with Sa'id, granting the latter control over [[Tur'an]] and [[Hittin]].<ref name=\"Joudah54\">Joudah, 1987, p. 54.</ref>\n\nAli refused to negotiate, gained the backing of Salibi, and the two defeated their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre.<ref name=\"Joudah54\"/> When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 [[Kuru\u015f|piasters]] and 25 [[Arabian horse]]s for the fortress.<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/> By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were put to rest for several years (until 1774\u201375), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn 1768 the central Ottoman authorities partially recognized or legitimized Zahir's ''de facto'' political position by granting him the title of \"Sheikh of Acre, Emir of Nazareth, Tiberias, Safed, and Sheikh of all Galilee\".<ref name=\"EoI\"/> However, this official recognition was tempered when Yaqub Agha was executed shortly after and Sulayman Agha died in 1770, depriving Zahir of close allies in Istanbul. In November 1770, Uthman Pasha had the governor of Sidon replaced by his son [[Darwish Pasha al-Kurji|Darwish Pasha]] and had his other son, Muhammad Pasha, appointed governor of [[Tripoli Eyalet]]. Uthman Pasha was committed to ending Zahir's rule, and Zahir's position was left particularly vulnerable with the loss of support in Istanbul.<ref>Philipp, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA39 39]\u201340.</ref> In response to threats from Damascus, Zahir further strengthened Acre's fortifications and armed every adult male in the city with a rifle, two pistols and a [[sabre]]. He also moved to mend ties with his sons, who held various tax farms in Galilee, and consolidate his relationship with the Shia clans of Jabal Amil, thereby strengthening his local alliances.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA40  40]</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Ali Bey and war with Damascus===\nAlthough Zahir was bereft of friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new alliance with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the [[Hejaz]], [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]]. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to [[Syria (region)|Syria]] for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Jaffa]] under commander [[Ismail Bey]].<ref name=\"Phillip41\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA41 41]</ref> Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made it as far as [[Muzayrib]], but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.<ref name=\"Rogan50\">Rogan, 2009, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=16U0mEbf4nAC&pg=PA50 50]</ref>\n\nZahir was surprised and angered by Ismail's reticence to attack. In a unilateral move to impose his authority in Uthman Pasha's jurisdiction, Zahir had his son Ahmad and other subordinate commanders collect taxes from villages in Damascus Eyalet, including [[Quneitra]], while he dispatched his other son Ali on a campaign against the Bani Nu'aym tribe in [[Hauran]], also part of Damascus.<ref name=\"Joudah70\">Joudah, 1987, p. 70.</ref> In response to Zahir's indignation, Ali Bey sent him 35,000 troops under [[Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab|Abu al-Dhahab]] in May.<ref name=\"Phillip41\"/> Together with Ismail's troops in Jaffa,<ref name=\"Rogan50\"/> the Egyptian army captured Damascus from Uthman Pasha in June, while Zahir and his Metawali allies captured the city of [[Sidon]] from Darwish Pasha. However, Abu al-Dhahab was persuaded by Ismail that confronting the Ottoman sultan, who carried a high religious authority as the [[caliph]] of Islam, was \"truly&nbsp;... a scheme of the Devil\" and a crime against their religion.<ref name=\"Rogan51\">Rogan, 2009, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=16U0mEbf4nAC&pg=PA51 51]</ref> A short time after capturing Damascus, Abu al-Dhahab and Ismail subsequently withdrew from the city, whose inhabitants were \"completely astonished at this amazing event\", according to a chronicler of the time period.<ref name=\"Rogan51\"/> The sudden turn of events compelled Zahir's forces to withdraw from Sidon on 20 June.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 81.</ref>\n\nAbu al-Dhahab's withdrawal frustrated Zahir who proceeded to make independent moves, first by capturing Jaffa in August 1771,<ref name=\"Phillip41\"/> after driving out its governor Ahmad Bey Tuqan, and shortly thereafter, capturing the cotton-producing Bani Sa'b region (centered around modern-day [[Tulkarm]]), which was held by Mustafa Bey Tuqan.<ref>Doumani, 1995, p.

By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful [[Jarrar clan]],<ref name=\"Doumani96\">Doumani, 1995, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zry-tpH3rz8C&pg=PA96 96]</ref> who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the ''miri'' (''hajj'' pilgrimage tax).<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 88.</ref> Nablus was under the ''de facto'' control of the [[Tuqan clan|Tuqan]] and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated.<ref name=\"Doumani96\"/>\n\nUthman Pasha had resumed his governorship of Damascus at the end of June 1771 and was determined to eliminate Zahir. To that end, he assembled a coalition that included his sons Darwish Pasha al-Kurji and Muhammad Pasha al-Kurji, who were the governors of Sidon and Tripoli, respectively, and Emir Yusuf Shihab of Mount Lebanon. In late August Uthman Pasha reached [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]] at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops.<ref name=\"Joudah84\"/> Before Uthman Pasha could be joined by his allies, Zahir and Sheikh Nasif of the Metawalis confronted the governor's troops on 2 September. Ali al-Zahir, Zahir's son and a commander of one of his four battlefield regiments, raided Uthman Pasha's camp, while Zahir's other troops blocked them from the west. Uthman Pasha's troops hastily retreated towards the [[Jordan River]], the only place where they were not surrounded. The overwhelming majority drowned in the river, with only 300\u2013500 survivors, including Uthman Pasha who almost drowned but was rescued by one of his men.<ref name=\"Joudah85\">Joudah, 1987, p. 85.</ref> The [[Battle of Lake Huleh (1771)|Battle of Lake Hula]] marked a decisive victory for Zahir, who entered Acre triumphantly with the spoils of Uthman Pasha's camp. He was celebrated by the residents of the city and on the way there, he was given honorary [[gun salute]]s by each of his fortified villages on the route between Tiberias and Acre. He also received congratulations from the French merchant ships at the port of Acre. Zahir's victory encouraged Ali Bey to relaunch his Syrian campaign.<ref name=\"Joudah85\"/>\n\nFollowing his victory against Uthman Pasha, Zahir demanded Darwish Pasha vacate Sidon, which he did on 13 October. He returned two days later after receiving the backing of Emir Yusuf. Zahir decided to move against Emir Yusuf, and together with his ally Sheikh Nasif, he confronted him at [[Nabatieh]] on 20 October. Emir Yusuf's men numbered some 37,000. Zahir's Metawali cavalry engaged in a maneuver where they fled the battlefield in apparent defeat, only to have the pursuant troops of Emir Yusuf surrounded by Zahir's men, who dealt Emir Yusuf's army a decisive blow. Emir Yusuf thereafter retreated to his mountain village of [[Deir al-Qamar]], while Sidon was left under the protection of Ali Jumblatt and 3,000 Druze defenders. However, with news of Zahir's victory, Ali Jumblatt and Darwish Pasha withdrew from Sidon, which was subsequently occupied by Zahir and Sheikh Nasif. Uthman Pasha and all of his sons were consequently dismissed from their posts by the Sublime Porte.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 86</ref> Although, he could not capture Nablus and its hinterland, Zahir's domain by the end of 1771 extended from Sidon to Jaffa and included an influential presence in the Hauran plain.<ref name=\"Phillip42\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA42 42].</ref>\n\nMuhammad Tuqan captured Jaffa from Zahir in May 1772, the same month that Ali Bey arrived in Acre to seek Zahir's protection after being forced out of Egypt by rival mamluks. In June, the Ottoman loyalist [[Jazzar Pasha]] sought to establish himself in [[Lebanon]] and took over [[Beirut]] from the local Druze chieftains. The Druze had previously been in conflict with Zahir, but due to Jazzar's offensive, the circumstances fostered an alliance between them, Zahir and the Metawali clans of Jabal Amil. Zahir and Ali Bey sought to take back Jaffa and, with help from the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Fleet]], succeeded after a nine-month siege, in which they exhausted many of their resources. Prior to that, in late October 1772, Zahir and his Lebanese allies captured Beirut from Jazzar, also with Russian naval support.<ref name=\"Phillip42\"/>\n\nIn March 1773, Ali Bey left Palestine to reestablish himself in Egypt, but Abu al-Dhahab had him killed when he arrived there.<ref name=\"Phillip42\"/> With this came an end to the alliance between Zahir and Ali Bey, which had brought together Egypt and Palestine politically and economically in a way that had not occurred since the early 16th century.<ref>D.

All of [[Ottoman Syria]] came under the official command of Uthman Pasha al-Misri in 1774 in order to bring stability to the provinces of the region. Al-Misri did not seek conflict with Zahir and sought to establish friendly terms with him. As such, he convinced the Sublime Porte to officially appoint Zahir as the governor of Sidon as long as Zahir paid all of the taxes the province had owed to the Porte. Al-Misri further promoted Zahir in February by declaring him \"Governor of Sidon, Nablus, Gaza, [[Ramla]], Jaffa and [[Ajlun|Jabal Ajlun]]\", although this title was not officially sanctioned by the Porte.<ref name=\"Phillip42\"/> In effect, Zahir was the ''de facto'' ruler over [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (with the exception of Nablus and Jerusalem), Jabal Amil, and the [[Syria (region)|Syria]]n coast from Gaza to Beirut.<ref>Philipp, 2001, pp.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA42  42]\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Downfall and death===\n[[File:Zahir al-Umar maximum extent map.svg|thumb|right|Zahir al-Umar's autonomous sheikhdom in 1774]]\n\nAl-Misri was recalled to Istanbul in the summer of 1774 and [[Muhammad Pasha al-Azm]] was appointed governor of Damascus. Thus, Zahir's governorship of Sidon was left vulnerable because it had largely depended on guarantees from al-Misri. Al-Azm sought peaceful relations with Zahir, but the Sublime Porte, having made [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|peace]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and relieving itself from that [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|conflict]], aimed to undermine the rebellious rulers of its provinces, including Zahir. Al-Azm managed to secure an official [[pardon]] of Zahir from the Porte in April 1775, but not the governorship of Sidon. Meanwhile, conflict between Zahir and his sons had reignited, with Ali of Safad attempting to capture Zahir's villages in Galilee in 1774. Zahir defeated Ali with support from his other son, Ahmad of Tiberias. Afterward, Zahir's rule was again challenged by one of his other sons, Sa'id,<ref name=\"Phillip43\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA43 43].</ref> later that year. In response to this challenge, Zahir armed and mobilized 300 of Acre's civilian inhabitants to counter Sa'id.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA137 137]</ref> Ali continued to undermine Zahir's rule by encouraging defections by Zahir's Maghrebi mercenaries through bribes.<ref name=\"Phillip43\"/>\n\nOn 20 May 1775, Abu al-Dhahab, having been encouraged by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al-Ifranj (the French [[Caravanserai]]) for safekeeping. On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon.<ref name=\"Joudah112\">Joudah, 1987, p. 112.</ref> Ali al-Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al-Dhahab's troops approached it a few days later.<ref name=\"Phillip43\"/> They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil.<ref name=\"Joudah112\"/> Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al-Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re-entered the city two days later and reestablished order with the assistance of Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli.<ref>Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA44 44].</ref> However, the setback of Abu al-Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands.<ref name=\"Joudah114\">Joudah, 1987, p. 114.</ref>\n\nOn 23 April, the Porte dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] [[Kapudan Pasha|admiral]], [[Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha|Hasan Pasha al-Jazayiri]], to blockade Acre. He reached Haifa on 7 August taking Jaffa from Zahir's son-in-law, Karim al-Ayyubi.<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/> Hasan Pasha ordered Zahir to pay the ''miri'' dues he owed to the Sublime Porte dating back to 1768. Zahir initially agreed to pay 500,000 piasters of the total amount upfront and a further 50,000 piasters to Hasan Pasha himself to \"spare the blood of the people\".<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/> Hasan Pasha apparently accepted Zahir's proposals, but the arrangements fell apart.<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/>\n\nThe accounts differ as to exactly how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure was the result of disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli.<ref name=\"Joudah114\"/> Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir not to pay Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the ''miri'' dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the ''miri'' dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.<ref name=\"Joudah115\">Joudah, 1987, p. 115.</ref>\n\nHasan proceeded to bombard Acre, and Zahir's Maghrebi artillerymen responded with cannon fire, damaging two of Hasan's ships. The following day, Hasan's fleet fired roughly 7,000 shells against Acre without returning fire from the city's artillerymen;<ref name=\"Joudah115\"/> al-Dinkizli had called on his Maghrebi forces to refrain from returning fire because as Muslims they were forbidden from attacking the sultan's military. Realizing his long-time deputy commander's betrayal, Zahir attempted to flee Acre on 21 or 22 August. As he departed its gates, he was fired on by Ottoman troops, with a bullet striking his neck and causing him to fall off his horse. A Maghrebi soldier then decapitated him. Zahir's severed head was subsequently delivered to Istanbul.<ref name=\"Joudah116\">Joudah, 1987, p. 116.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nFollowing his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih were arrested by Hasan Pasha's men.<ref name=\"Joudah117\">Joudah, 1987, p. 117.</ref> The Sublime Porte also seized property belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital along with their physician, who was known to be talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha.<ref>Thackston, 1988, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ISHHYMNmp0gC&pg=PA17 17]\u201318.</ref> Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of [[Gaza Sanjak|Gaza]], but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.<ref name=\"Joudah116\"/>\n\nZahir's sons Uthman, Ahmad, Sa'id and Ali continued to put up resistance, with the latter putting up the longest fight from his fortress in Deir Hanna. The fortress eventually capitulated to the combined forces of Hasan Pasha and Jazzar Pasha on 22 July 1776. Ali fled, but was killed later that year in the area between Tiberias and Safad. By then, the rest of Zahir's sons had been arrested or killed. Abbas was later appointed by Sultan [[Selim III]] as the Sheikh of Safad. However, in 1799, when [[Napoleon]] invaded Palestine, but withdrew after being [[Siege of Acre (1799)|defeated in Acre]], Abbas and Salih both left Safad with the departing French forces. This marked the end of Zaydani influence in Galilee.<ref name=\"Joudah117\"/>\n\n[[Constantin-Fran\u00e7ois Chasseb\u0153uf|Constantin-Fran\u00e7ois Volney]], who wrote the first European biography of Zahir in 1787,<ref>Volney, 1788, p. [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Kz0NAAAAYAAJ/page/n101 91]</ref> lists three main reasons for Zahir's failure. First, the lack of \"internal good order and justness of principle\". Secondly, the early concessions he made to his children. Third, and most of all, the avarice of his adviser and confidant, Ibrahim Sabbagh.<ref>Volney, 1788, p.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA153 153].</ref> which became the capital of his territory. Except for Acre and Haifa, Zahir divided the remainder of his territory between his relatives. His eldest brother was appointed to Deir Hanna, and his younger brothers Yusuf and Salih Abu Dani were installed in [[I'billin]] and Arraba, respectively.<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> Zahir appointed his eldest son Salibi as the ''multazim'' of Tiberias.<ref name=\"Phillip153\"/> Salibi was killed in 1773 fighting alongside Ali Bey's forces in Egypt.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 110.</ref> His death deeply distressed Zahir, who was around 80 years old at the time.<ref>Sabbagh, 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8CAzGKXK6acC&pg=PP22 41].</ref> He appointed Uthman in [[Kafr Kanna]] then Shefa-'Amr,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> Abbas in Nazareth, Ali in Safad, and Ahmad in Saffuriya. Ahmad replaced Salibi in Tiberias as well, and also conquered Ajlun and [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. In addition, Ahmad was given authority over Deir Hanna after Sa'd's death. Zahir appointed his nephew Ayyub al-Karimi in Jaffa and Gaza,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> while al-Dinkizli was made ''multazim'' in Sidon in 1774. The appointment of Zahir's relatives and close associates was meant to ensure the efficient administration of his expanding realm and the loyalty of his circle. Among their chief functions was to ensure the supply of cotton to Acre. It is not clear if these posts were recognized by the Ottoman government.<ref name=\"Phillip153\"/>\n\nZahir had an aide who jointly served in the capacity of ''mudabbir'' (manager) and ''wazir'' ([[vizier]]) to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence.<ref name=\"Joudah39\">Joudah, 1987, p. 39.</ref> This official had always been a Melkite (local Greek Catholic). His first ''wazir'' was Yusuf al-Arqash,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to [[Malta]].<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh,<ref name=\"Joudah127\"/> who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local [[Greek Orthodox Christian]] and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite.<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir largely because of the wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in [[Damietta]], Egypt.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 126.</ref> Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's political adviser, main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials.<ref name=\"Joudah128\">Joudah, 1987, p. 128.</ref>\n\nThere were other officials in Zahir's civil administration in Acre, including chief religious officials, namely the ''[[mufti]]'' and the ''[[qadi]]''. The mufti was the chief scholar among the ''[[ulama]]'' (Muslim scholarly community) and oversaw the interpretation of [[Islamic law]] in Zahir's realm. He was appointed by the Sublime Porte, but Zahir managed to maintain the same ''mufti'' for many years at a time in contrast with the typical Syrian province which saw its ''mufti'' replaced annually. Zahir directly appointed the ''qadi'' from Palestine's local ''ulama'', but his judicial decisions had to be approved by the ''qadi'' of Sidon.<ref name=\"Joudah128\"/> Zahir had a chief [[imam]], who in the last years of his rule was Ali ibn Khalid al-Shaabi.<ref>Reichmuth, 2009, pp.&nbsp;45\u201346.</ref> An ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'' was also appointed to supervise the customs payments made by the European merchants in Acre and Haifa.<ref name=\"Joudah128\"/>\n\nZahir's initial military forces consisted of his Zaydani kinsmen and the local inhabitants of the areas he ruled. They numbered about 200 men in the early 1720s, but grew to about 1,500 in the early 1730s. During this early period of Zahir's career, he also had the key military backing of the Bani Saqr and other Bedouin tribes. As he consolidated his hold over Galilee, his army rose to over 4,000 men, many of the later recruits being peasants who supported Zahir for protecting them against Bedouin raids. This suppression of the Bedouin in turn caused the tribes to largely withdraw their military backing of Zahir. The core of his private army were the Maghrebi mercenaries. The Maghrebis' commander, Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli, also served as Zahir's top military commander from 1735 until al-Dinkizli's defection during the Ottoman siege of Acre in 1775. From the time Zahir reconciled with Sheikh Nasif al-Nassar of Jabal Amil in 1768 until most of the remainder of his rule, Zahir also had the support of Nasif's roughly 10,000 Metawali cavalrymen. However, the Metawalis did not aid Zahir during the Ottoman offensive of 1775. Zahir's fortified villages and towns were equipped with artillery installments and his army's arsenal consisted of cannons, matchlock rifles, pistols and lances. Most of the firearms were imported from [[Venice]] or France, and by the early 1770s, from the Russian imperial navy.<ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 129.</ref>\n\n===General security===\n[[File:Yehiam-fortress-1879.jpg|thumb|right|Zahir rebuilt the Crusader-era [[Yehi'am Fortress National Park|fortress]] at [[Khirbat Jiddin]] ]]\n\nAccording to biographer Ahmad Hasan Joudah, the two principal conditions Zahir established to foster his sheikhdom's prosperity and its survival were \"security and justice\".<ref name=\"Joudah37\">Joudah, 1987, p. 37.</ref> Prior to Zahir's consolidation of power, the villages of northern Palestine were prone to Bedouin raids and robberies and the roads were under constant threat from highway robbers and Bedouin attacks. Although following the looting raids, the inhabitants of these agrarian villages were left destitute, the Ottoman provincial government would nonetheless attempt to collect from them the ''miri'' (hajj tax). To avoid punitive measures for not paying the ''miri'', the inhabitants would abandon their villages for safety in the larger towns or the desert. This situation hurt the economy of the region as the raids sharply reduced the villages' agricultural output, the government-appointed ''[[mutasallim]]s'' ([[tax farm]]ers) could not collect their impositions, and trade could not be safely conducted due to insecurity on the roads.<ref name=\"Joudah37\"/>\n\nBy 1746, however, Zahir had established order in the lands he ruled.<ref>Joudah, 1987, pp.&nbsp;37\u201338.</ref> He managed to co-opt the dominant Bedouin tribe of the region, the Bani Saqr, which greatly contributed to the establishment of security in northern Palestine.<ref>Philipp, 1992, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8n1tAAAAMAAJ&q=Zahir+Umar+security&dq=Zahir+Umar+security&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAWoVChMIybOouNznxgIVyqQeCh3oDwsH 94].</ref> Moreover, Zahir charged the ''sheikhs'' of the towns and villages of northern Palestine with ensuring the safety of the roads in their respective vicinity and required them to compensate anyone who was robbed of his/her property. General security reached a level whereby \"an old woman with gold in her hand could travel from one place to another without fear or danger\", according to biographer Mikhail Sabbagh.<ref name=\"Joudah38\">Joudah, 1987, p. 38.</ref>\n\nThis period of calm that persisted between 1744 and 1765 greatly boosted the security and economy of Galilee. The security established in the region encouraged people from other parts of the Ottoman Empire to immigrate to Galilee.<ref name=\"Phillip38\"/> Conflict between the local clans and between Zahir and his sons remained limited to periodic clashes, while there were no attacks against Zahir's domain from outside forces.<ref name=\"Phillip39\"/> While Zahir used force to strengthen his position in the region, the local inhabitants generally took comfort in his rule, which historian Thomas Philip described as \"relatively just and reasonably fair\".<ref name=\"Philip32\"/> According to [[Richard Pococke]] who visited the area in 1737, the local people had great admiration for Zahir, especially for his war against bandits on the roads.<ref>[[Richard Pococke|Pococke]], 1745, vol 2, p. [https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009339611#page/n100/mode/1up 69]</ref>\n\n===Economic policies===\nIn addition to providing security, Zahir and his local deputies adopted a policy of aiding the peasants cultivate and harvest their farmlands to further guarantee the steady supply of agricultural products for export. These benefits included loans to peasants and the distribution of free seeds.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/> Financial burdens on the peasants were also reduced as Zahir offered tax relief during drought seasons or when the harvest seasons were poor.<ref name=\"Phillip38\"/><ref>Joudah, 1987, p. 123.</ref> This same tax relief was extended to newcomers who sought to begin cultivating new farmlands.<ref name=\"Phillip38\"/> Moreover, Zahir assumed responsibility for outstanding payments the peasants owed to merchants from credit-based transactions if the merchants could provide proof of unsatisfactory payment.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/> According to historian Thomas Philipp, Zahir \"had the good business sense not to exploit peasants to the point of destruction, but kept his financial demands to a more moderate level.\"<ref name=\"Phillip38\">Philipp, 2001, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=95I5QVdp4_gC&pg=PA38 38].</ref> He regularly paid the Ottoman authorities their financial dues, ensuring a degree of stability in his relationship with the sultanate.<ref name=\"Hitti688\">Hitti, 1951, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=91YymsCw5DIC&pg=PA688 688].</ref>\n\nWhen Zahir conquered Acre, he transformed it from a decaying village into a fortified market hub for Palestinian products, including silk, wheat, olive oil, tobacco and cotton, which he exported to Europe.<ref name=\"Hitti688\"/><ref>Lehmann, 2014, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2C5iBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA31  31]</ref> With cotton in particular, Zahir was able to monopolize the market for it and its foreign export. He did business with European merchants based in Galilee's ports, who competed with one another for the cotton and grain cultivated in the rural villages under Zahir's dominion or influence in Galilee's hinterland and Jabal Amil.<ref name=Kushner249>D. Crecelius: \"Egypt's Reawakening Interest in Palestine During the Regimes of Ali Bey al-Kabir and Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dahab: 1760\u20131775\". In Kushner, 1986, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XgRDT9wMUhYC&pg=PA249 249]</ref> Previously, European merchants made direct transactions with local cotton growers, but Zahir, with the help of Ibrahim Sabbagh, put an end to this system of commerce by making himself the middleman between the merchants and the growers living under his rule. This allowed him to both monopolize cotton production and the merchants' price for the product.<ref>Doumani, 1995, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zry-tpH3rz8C&pg=PA98 98].</ref> Zahir's designation of prices for the local [[cash crop]]s also prevented \"exploitation\" of the peasants and local merchants by European merchants and their \"manipulation of the prices\", according to Joudah.<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> This caused financial losses to the European merchants who lodged numerous complaints to the French and English ambassadors to the Sublime Porte. A formal agreement to regulate commerce between Zahir and the European merchants was reached in 1753.<ref name=\"Joudah39\"/> Zahir further encouraged trade by offering local merchants interest-free loans.<ref name=\"Joudah38\"/>\n\nThe high European demand for the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his autonomous sheikhdom. This control of the cotton market also allowed him to gain unofficial control over all of the Sidon Eyalet, outside the city of Sidon itself.<ref name=\"Shanahan23\">Shanahan, 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vPgBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA23 23]</ref> With mixed success, Zahir attempted to have French merchant ships redirected from the ports of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and Sidon to Haifa instead, in order to benefit from the customs fees he could exact.<ref>Yazbak, 1998, p.

As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee,<ref name=\"Barnay15\"/> Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742,<ref>Moammar, 1990, p. 70.</ref> along with Muslims.<ref name=\"Barnay15\">Barnay, 1992, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GdEDefYc4u0C&pg=PA15 15]</ref> Zahir did not consider Jews to be a threat to his rule and believed that their connections with the [[Jewish diaspora]] would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance in the construction of Jewish homes, schools and [[synagogue]]s, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area.<ref>Barnay, 1992, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GdEDefYc4u0C&pg=PA148 148]</ref> The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from [[Aleppo]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Smyrna]].<ref name=\"Sabbagh38\">Sabbagh, 2006, p.

In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the [[Maronites|Maronite]] and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively.<ref name=\"Emmett22\">Emmett, 1995, p.

R. Khoury: \"Political Relations Between City and State in the Middle East 1700\u20131850\", in Sluglett, 2008, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eYqiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA94 94]</ref>\n\nZahir allowed the [[Franciscan]] community of Nazareth to build churches in 1730, 1741 and 1754 on sites Christians associated with [[Jesus]]'s life. He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation|St. Gabriel's Church]] over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth,<ref name=\"Emmett22\"/> and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest church in the city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As a testament to the prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built under the auspices of Zahir's less tolerant successors.<ref name=\"Phillip177\"/>\n\nA strong relationship existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs and merchant class. Zahir maintained law and order in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skills.<ref name=\"Shanahan23\"/> Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their successful conflict with the Druze [[Jumblatt family|Jumblatt clan]] and the Shihab clan under Mulhim Shihab,<ref>Winter, 2010, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGeuAeFFJCEC&pg=PA132 132]</ref> <ref name=\"Shanahan23\"/>.\n\nThe relationship between Zahir and the rural sheikhs of the Druze of Mount Lebanon under the Shihab dynasty were mixed. While Sheikh Mansur Shihab of [[Chouf]] allied himself with Zahir, his nephew and rival, Yusuf Shihab of the [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] region remained supportive of the Ottomans.<ref>Harris, 2012, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jY4ImTGnamUC&pg=PA120 120]</ref> Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze ''emirs'' of Mount Lebanon, he Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. In the oral traditions of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression. During this period, many Druze villages were either destroyed or abandoned and there was a partial Druze exodus from Galilee, particularly from the villages around Safad, to the Hauran region east of the Jordan River.<ref>Firro, 1992, p.

Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775.<ref name=\"Joudah55\">Joudah, 1987, p. 55.</ref> Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power.<ref name=\"Joudah55\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 16791 Archeological sites of Israel.JPG|thumb|right|The fortress of [[Shefa-'Amr]], built by Zahir's son Uthman]]\n\nZahir's rule radically changed the landscape of Galilee.

The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.<ref>Orser, 1996, p.

In particular the Palestinians consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian society that has elevated Zahir and his legacy to near-iconic status. These re-readings are not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the ongoing consequences of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]]. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a \"little Kingdom,\" as [[Albert Hourani]] called it, in most of Palestine for over a quarter of a century.<ref name=\"Joudah2nded\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Building works===\n[[File:Saraya Building Nazareth 022.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Seraya]] of [[Nazareth]], built by Zahir]]\n\nZahir and his family built fortresses, watchtowers, warehouses, and ''khans'' (caravanserais).

The city is located in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]] the city's population is 57,713.\n\n==History==\nWhat is now San Rafael was once the site of several [[Coast Miwok]] villages: '''Awani-wi''', near downtown San Rafael, '''Ewu''', near [[Terra Linda, San Rafael, California|Terra Linda]] and '''Shotomko-cha''', in [[Marinwood]].<ref>Peterson, Bonnie J. (1976). ''Dawn of the World: Coast Miwok Myths''. {{ISBN|0-912908-04-1}}</ref>\n[[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]] was founded in what is now downtown San Rafael as the 20th [[Spain|Spanish]] mission in the colonial [[Mexico|Mexican]] province of ''[[Alta California]]'' by three priests\u2014Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]] from [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]], Father Abella from [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], Father [[Luis G\u00edl y Taboada]] from [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los Angeles]]\u2014on Dec. 14, 1817, four years before [[Mexico]] gained independence from [[Spain]]. Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel was located a donkey's day walk to the mission below it. The mission and the city are named after the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the Angel of Healing.\n\nThe mission was originally planned as a hospital site for [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] who had become ill at the cold [[San Francisco]] [[Mission Dolores]]. Father Luis Gil, who spoke several Native American languages, was put in charge of the facility. In part because of its ideal weather, San Rafael was later upgraded to full mission status in 1822.  The mission had 300 converts within its first year, and 1,140 converts by 1828. The Mexican government took over the California missions in 1834, and [[Mission San Rafael]] was abandoned in 1844, eventually falling into ruin. The current mission was built in 1949 in the style of the original, but faces at right angles to the alignment of the original.\n\nThe [[San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad]] reached San Rafael in 1879 and was linked to the national rail network in 1888.  The [[United States Navy]] operated a San Pablo Bay [[degaussing]] range from San Rafael through [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/CA.html|title=U.S. Naval Activities World War II by State|publisher=Patrick Clancey|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|16.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}} of it (26.55%) is water. South of the county is [[San Francisco]].\n\nNotable landmarks include:\n* [[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]], around which the city developed\n* the [[Marin County Civic Center]] building, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n* the [[Rafael Film Center]]\n* [[China Camp State Park]], and\n* [[KernerFX|Kerner Studios]].\n* [[Peacock Gap Golf Course]] which is open to the public.\n\nThere are several public parks in the city.\n\n==Environmental features==\nThe San Rafael shoreline has been historically filled to a considerable extent to accommodate land development, with underlying bay mud (saturated clayed silt) of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} in thickness.  At certain locations such as Murphys Point, the sandstone or shale rock outcrops through the mud.\n\nSan Rafael has a wide diversity of natural habitats from forests at the higher elevations to marshland and estuarine settings.  Its marshes are home to the [[endangered species]] [[Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse]].  There are also [[riparian]] areas including the [[San Rafael Creek]] and [[Miller Creek (Marin County, California)|Miller Creek]] corridors.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Rafael has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csb''), with mild winter lows seldom reaching the freezing mark.

The city is located in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]] the city's population is 57,713.\n\n==History==\nWhat is now San Rafael was once the site of several [[Coast Miwok]] villages: '''Awani-wi''', near downtown San Rafael, '''Ewu''', near [[Terra Linda, San Rafael, California|Terra Linda]] and '''Shotomko-cha''', in [[Marinwood]].<ref>Peterson, Bonnie J. (1976). ''Dawn of the World: Coast Miwok Myths''. {{ISBN|0-912908-04-1}}</ref>\n[[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]] was founded in what is now downtown San Rafael as the 20th [[Spain|Spanish]] mission in the colonial [[Mexico|Mexican]] province of ''[[Alta California]]'' by three priests\u2014Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]] from [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]], Father Abella from [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]], Father [[Luis G\u00edl y Taboada]] from [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Reina de los Angeles]]\u2014on Dec. 14, 1817, four years before [[Mexico]] gained independence from [[Spain]]. Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel was located a donkey's day walk to the mission below it. The mission and the city are named after the [[Archangel]] [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], the Angel of Healing. \n\nThe mission was originally planned as a hospital site for [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] who had become ill at the cold [[San Francisco]] [[Mission Dolores]]. Father Luis Gil, who spoke several Native American languages, was put in charge of the facility. In part because of its ideal weather, San Rafael was later upgraded to full mission status in 1822.  The mission had 300 converts within its first year, and 1,140 converts by 1828. The Mexican government took over the California missions in 1834, and [[Mission San Rafael]] was abandoned in 1844, eventually falling into ruin. The current mission was built in 1949 in the style of the original, but faces at right angles to the alignment of the original.\n\nThe [[San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad]] reached San Rafael in 1879 and was linked to the national rail network in 1888.  The [[United States Navy]] operated a San Pablo Bay [[degaussing]] range from San Rafael through [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/CA.html|title=U.S. Naval Activities World War II by State|publisher=Patrick Clancey|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|16.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}} of it (26.55%) is water. South of the county is [[San Francisco]].\n\nNotable landmarks include:\n* [[Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel]], around which the city developed\n* the [[Marin County Civic Center]] building, designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\n* the [[Rafael Film Center]]\n* [[China Camp State Park]], and\n* [[KernerFX|Kerner Studios]].\n* [[Peacock Gap Golf Course]] which is open to the public.\n\nThere are several public parks in the city.\n\n==Environmental features==\nThe San Rafael shoreline has been historically filled to a considerable extent to accommodate land development, with underlying bay mud (saturated clayed silt) of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} in thickness.  At certain locations such as Murphys Point, the sandstone or shale rock outcrops through the mud.\n\nSan Rafael has a wide diversity of natural habitats from forests at the higher elevations to marshland and estuarine settings.  Its marshes are home to the [[endangered species]] [[Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse]].  There are also [[riparian]] areas including the [[San Rafael Creek]] and [[Miller Creek (Marin County, California)|Miller Creek]] corridors.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Rafael has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csb''), with mild winter lows seldom reaching the freezing mark.

As a third-class midshipman (sophomore) in [[1962 Navy Midshipmen football team|1962]], he got his first opportunity to play in the third game of the season, against the [[1962 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|University of Minnesota]] on October 6. He relieved starter Ron Klemick as the Minnesota defense, led by [[Bobby Bell]] and [[Carl Eller]], was stifling in its 21\u20130 victory. Staubach was 0\u20132 passing and was sacked twice for -24 yards.\n\nA week later, playing against [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell]] University, with the offense failing, Hall of Fame coach [[Wayne Hardin]] decided to put Staubach into the game to see if he could improve the team's offense. He led Navy to six touchdowns, throwing for 99 yards, and two touchdowns while running for 88 yards and another score as Navy won 41\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jhowell.net/cf/scores/Navy.htm |title=Navy Historical Scores |work=Jhowell.net |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Staubach started again in the famous [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army\u2013Navy]] game. President [[John F. Kennedy]] (himself a former naval officer), who just 37 days earlier had negotiated the end of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], attended the game, performing the coin toss. Staubach led the team to a 34\u201314 upset over Army, throwing for two touchdowns and running for another.\n\nIn his second class (junior) season of [[1963 Navy Midshipmen football team|1963]], he won the [[Heisman Trophy]], [[Maxwell Award]], and the [[Washington D.C.

The Cowboys won the first [[NFC Championship Game|NFC title]] in [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|1970]] with [[Craig Morton]] starting at quarterback, but lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl V]], losing by three points on a last-second field goal.\n\nIn [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|1971]], Morton began the season as the starter, but after a loss to the [[1971 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], Staubach assumed the role. However, in a game against the [[1971 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] during the seventh week of that season, coach [[Tom Landry]] alternated Staubach and Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline. Dallas gained almost 500 yards of offense but committed seven turnovers that resulted in a 23\u201319 loss to a mediocre Bears squad that dropped the Cowboys to 4\u20133 for the season, two games behind the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in the [[NFC East]] race.\n\nStaubach assumed the full-time quarterbacking duties in a week-eight victory over the [[1971 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and led the Cowboys to 10 consecutive victories, including their first Super Bowl victory, 24\u20133 over the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VI]] in January 1972. He was named the game's [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], completing 12 out of 19 passes for 119 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for 18 yards.

He retired at the conclusion of the season in order to protect his long-term health, declining the Cowboys' offer for two more seasons. He suffered 20 [[concussion]]s in his playing career, including six in which he said he was \"knocked out\". After suffering two concussions in 1979, a doctor at Cornell told Staubach that while his brain tests were fine at the moment, another concussion could have life-altering consequences.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2013/08/29/roger-staubach-concussion-nfl/2730207/ | work=USA Today | first1=Lindsay H. | last1=Jones | title=Despite 20 concussions, Roger Staubach stayed out of lawsuit | date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> He chose to retire and was succeeded as the Cowboys starting quarterback by [[Danny White]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123687/index.htm | work=CNN | title=The Great White Hope | date=August 18, 1980}}</ref>\n\nOverall, Staubach finished his 11 NFL seasons with 1,685 completions for 22,700 yards and 153 touchdowns, with 109 interceptions.

The company first developed several office buildings; Holloway managed construction while Staubach found tenants. In 1982, Staubach bought out Holloway and shifted the company's emphasis from commercial development to representing corporate clients seeking to lease or buy space. This proved fortuitous as a boom in Dallas office construction followed by a recession in the Texas oil industry left the city with excess office space, so companies representing tenants wielded greater influence. The company has worked with major businesses including AT&T, McDonald's Corporation, Hospital Corporation of America and K Mart Corporation. The company was also involved with residential development, with ownership stakes in 27 apartments and other real estate projects in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Some of these were in partnership with Cowboys teammate [[Bob Breunig]] through S.B.C. Development Corporation, then a subsidiary of the Staubach Company. Others were collaborations with local developers and investors, including [[Ross Perot]].<ref name=\"Bancroft\"/> He served as its chairman and CEO until June 20, 2007, when he announced he would resign as CEO of the multibillion-dollar real estate company he started 30 years earlier.\n\nOn July 11, 2008, The Staubach Company was sold to [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] for $613 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aF_hGppuRtjk&refer=home |title=Jones Lang LaSalle to Buy Staubach for $613 million |work=Bloomberg.com |date= June 16, 2008|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> Staubach and his children's trust would gross more than $100 million from the sale by 2013.

The Cowboys won the first [[NFC Championship Game|NFC title]] in [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|1970]] with [[Craig Morton]] starting at quarterback, but lost to the [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] in [[Super Bowl V]], losing by three points on a last-second field goal.\n\nIn [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|1971]], Morton began the season as the starter, but after a loss to the [[1971 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], Staubach assumed the role. However, in a game against the [[1971 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] during the seventh week of that season, coach [[Tom Landry]] alternated Staubach and Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline. Dallas gained almost 500 yards of offense but committed seven turnovers that resulted in a 23\u201319 loss to a mediocre Bears squad that dropped the Cowboys to 4\u20133 for the season, two games behind the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in the [[NFC East]] race.\n\nStaubach assumed the full-time quarterbacking duties in a week-eight victory over the [[1971 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and led the Cowboys to 10 consecutive victories, including their first Super Bowl victory, 24\u20133 over the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] in [[Super Bowl VI]] in January 1972. He was named the game's [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], completing 12 out of 19 passes for 119 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for 18 yards.

He threw for 183 yards and a touchdown, with no interceptions, in Dallas' 27\u201310 victory in Super Bowl XII over the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], led by his former teammate Morton. Staubach also led the Cowboys to appearances in [[Super Bowl X]] and [[Super Bowl XIII]], where they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] both times by a total of eight points.\n\nStaubach's offensive teammates included standout receivers \"Bullet\" [[Bob Hayes]], [[Lance Alworth]], [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and [[Golden Richards]], tight ends [[Mike Ditka]], [[Billy Joe Dupree]] and [[Jackie Smith]], tackle [[Rayfield Wright]] and running backs [[Robert Newhouse]], [[Calvin Hill]] and [[Tony Dorsett]]. Dorsett, Hayes and Wright are in the Hall of Fame, as are Alworth, Ditka and Smith (although those three were all with the Cowboys only at the end of their careers).\n\nIn his final NFL season of [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|1979]], Staubach scored career highs in completions (267), passing yards (3,586) and touchdown passes (27), with just 11 interceptions. He retired at the conclusion of the season in order to protect his long-term health, declining the Cowboys' offer for two more seasons. He suffered 20 [[concussion]]s in his playing career, including six in which he said he was \"knocked out\". After suffering two concussions in 1979, a doctor at Cornell told Staubach that while his brain tests were fine at the moment, another concussion could have life-altering consequences.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2013/08/29/roger-staubach-concussion-nfl/2730207/ | work=USA Today | first1=Lindsay H. | last1=Jones | title=Despite 20 concussions, Roger Staubach stayed out of lawsuit | date=August 29, 2013}}</ref> He chose to retire and was succeeded as the Cowboys starting quarterback by [[Danny White]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123687/index.htm | work=CNN | title=The Great White Hope | date=August 18, 1980}}</ref>\n\nOverall, Staubach finished his 11 NFL seasons with 1,685 completions for 22,700 yards and 153 touchdowns, with 109 interceptions.

With seconds on the clock and the Cowboys trailing 14\u201310, Staubach launched a 50-yard bomb to wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], who caught the pass and strode into the end zone for a 17\u201314 victory.<ref name=cbmply>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=24cqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1VoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7125%2C5432861 |newspaper=Victoria Advocate |location=Texas |agency=Associated Press |title=Cowboys work miracle play |date=December 29, 1975 |page=1B}}</ref> After the game, Staubach said he threw the ball and said a \"[[Hail Mary]]\". Since then, any last-second pass to the end zone in a desperate attempt to score a game-winning or tying touchdown is referred to as a [[Hail Mary pass|\"Hail Mary\" pass]].\n\nStaubach was named The Walter Camp \"Man of the Year\" in 1983,<ref>[http://waltercamp.org/index.php/teams_and_awards/awards/P100/ Awards \u2014 Walter Camp Football Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609021344/http://waltercamp.org/index.php/teams_and_awards/awards/P100/ |date=June 9, 2008 }}</ref> and was awarded the Davey O'Brien Legends Award in 2001.<ref>[http://www.daveyobrien.org/adminnm/templates/awards.asp?articleid=20&zoneid=3 The Davey O'Brien Award - National Quarterback Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004222654/http://www.daveyobrien.org/adminnm/templates/awards.asp?articleid=20&zoneid=3 |date=October 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Staubach its Lone Sailor Award for his naval service.\n\nOn the occasion of the 30th anniversary of [[Super Bowl VI]] in 2002, Staubach, accompanied by former [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]], flipped the coin at [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], played at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], where his only other [[Super Bowl XII|Super Bowl victory]] took place.\n\nOn January 25, 2007, Staubach was named chairman of the North Texas [[Super Bowl XLV]] Bid Committee,<ref name=\"dalbiz\">\n{{cite news|title=Staubach to lead Dallas Super Bowl bid |work=Dallas Business Journal |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2007/01/22/daily38.html |accessdate=February 21, 2007 |first=Dave |last=Moore |date=January 25, 2007}}</ref> whose goal was to have the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]] host the Super Bowl in 2011. On May 23, 2007, the NFL chose Dallas as the host city of [[Super Bowl XLV]].\n\nIn 2010, Staubach was named the No. 1 Dallas Cowboy of all time according to a poll conducted by the ''Dallas Morning News''.\n\nIn November 2018, Staubach was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], becoming one of only four recipients associated with American Football to receive the distinction. He was the first player to receive the award, given it at the same time as Minnesota Vikings DT [[Alan Page]]. The other two recipients, [[Earl Blaik]] and [[Bear Bryant]], were both head coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/25232862/babe-ruth-roger-staubach-alan-page-receive-presidential-medal-freedom|title=Babe Ruth, Roger Staubach, Alan Page to receive Presidential Medal of Freedom|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=November 16, 2018|date=November 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Real estate===\nIn 1977, he started a commercial real estate business, The Staubach Company, in partnership with Robert Holloway Jr., an associate of [[Henry S. Miller]].<ref name=\"Bancroft\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/magazine/a-texas-power-play.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Bancroft | title=A Texas Power Play | date=June 11, 1989}}</ref> He had prepared by working in the off-seasons from 1970 until 1977 for the [[Henry S. Miller Company]]. Staubach began working with real estate because \"I couldn't have retired at my age and just played golf. First of all, they didn't pay quarterbacks what they do today. And I was 37 with three kids. I kept thinking about [what would happen] if some linebacker takes off my head and I can't play anymore.\" He said \"Henry Miller Jr. was a lot like [legendary Cowboys coach Tom] [[Tom Landry|Landry]]. They both had similar haircuts ... they both had phenomenal integrity, great work ethic, and they could transfer their strengths to other people.\"<ref name=\"dmagazine.com\"/>\n\nThe Staubach Company has been his primary endeavor since retirement from football. The company first developed several office buildings; Holloway managed construction while Staubach found tenants. In 1982, Staubach bought out Holloway and shifted the company's emphasis from commercial development to representing corporate clients seeking to lease or buy space. This proved fortuitous as a boom in Dallas office construction followed by a recession in the Texas oil industry left the city with excess office space, so companies representing tenants wielded greater influence. The company has worked with major businesses including AT&T, McDonald's Corporation, Hospital Corporation of America and K Mart Corporation. The company was also involved with residential development, with ownership stakes in 27 apartments and other real estate projects in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Some of these were in partnership with Cowboys teammate [[Bob Breunig]] through S.B.C. Development Corporation, then a subsidiary of the Staubach Company. Others were collaborations with local developers and investors, including [[Ross Perot]].<ref name=\"Bancroft\"/> He served as its chairman and CEO until June 20, 2007, when he announced he would resign as CEO of the multibillion-dollar real estate company he started 30 years earlier.\n\nOn July 11, 2008, The Staubach Company was sold to [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] for $613 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aF_hGppuRtjk&refer=home |title=Jones Lang LaSalle to Buy Staubach for $613 million |work=Bloomberg.com |date= June 16, 2008|accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> Staubach and his children's trust would gross more than $100 million from the sale by 2013. The sale provided an initial payment of $9.27 per Staubach share with additional payments due during the ensuing five years for a total of approximately $29/share. Staubach took half of his first payment in Jones Lang LaSalle stock which was then trading at approximately $59.50/share. Staubach currently serves as executive chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle.<ref name=\"dmagazine.com\"/>\n\nOn December 27, 2011, Staubach wrote the foreword for a book titled ''The Power in a Link'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-Link-Change-Business-LinkedIn/dp/1118134672 |title=The Power in a Link: Open Doors, Close Deals, and Change the Way you do Business Using LinkedIn |work=Amazon.com |date= December 27, 2011|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref> published by [[John Wiley & Sons]], authored by [[United States Military Academy]] graduate, David Gowel.\n\n===Other===\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, he was a spokesperson for the men's clothing retailer [[Anderson Little]], appearing in both print and television advertisements. Later, he did television advertisements for [[Rolaids]] as well.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Staubach worked for a brief time as a [[color commentator]] for [[NFL on CBS|CBS Sports]]' NFL telecasts. On November 9, 1980, during a close game between the [[New York Giants]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Staubach broadcast a nostalgic comment by exclaiming he would like to be \"right down there in the middle of it\". The Cowboys [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|lost 38\u201335]].\n\nStaubach jointly owned [[Hall of Fame Racing]], a [[NASCAR]] [[Nextel Cup Series]] team, with fellow former Cowboy and hall-of-famer [[Troy Aikman]], which began racing for the [[2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2006 season]].\n\nIn 2009, Staubach was honored with the \"Lombardi Award of Excellence\" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor coach [[Vince Lombardi|Lombardi]]'s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the \"spirit\" of the coach.\n\n===Politics===\nOn September 25, 2007, a fundraising email was sent out from the presidential campaign of Senator [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) with a letter from Roger Staubach asking recipients to make a contribution before the [[Federal Election Commission]] third-quarter reporting date of September 30, 2007.\n\nStaubach is a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who has often been mentioned as a possible candidate for political office and had once been asked to campaign for U.S. Senator. He received a single vote for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] nomination at the [[1976 Republican National Convention]].

It was the fourth game to use the [[SCUMM]] adventure game engine, and the first of those to avoid the verb\u2013object interface introduced in ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nA departure from other [[LucasArts adventure games|Lucasfilm adventure games]] in many senses, ''Loom'' is based on a serious and complex [[fantasy]] story. With its experimental interface, it eschewed the traditional paradigm of graphical adventures, where puzzles usually involve interactions between the game character, the environment, and items the character has in their possession.\n\n''Loom''{{'s}} gameplay centers instead around magical four-note tunes known as \"drafts\" that the protagonist, Bobbin Threadbare, can play on his [[distaff]]. Each draft is a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] that has an effect of a certain type, such as \"Opening\" or \"Night Vision.\" Some drafts can be reversed by playing their notes backwards, so the \"Dye\" draft played backwards becomes \"Bleach,\" while others, such as the \"Terror\" draft, are [[palindrome]]s (e.g. C\u2013E\u2013E\u2013C) and so cannot be reversed in this manner.\n\n[[Image:Loom interface screenshot.png|thumb|right|An early scene from the game showing the distaff in the lower left and a selected object (the Great Loom) in the lower right.]]\n\nBobbin can learn drafts by observing an object that possesses the qualities of the desired draft; for example, by examining a blade while it is being sharpened, Bobbin can learn the \"Sharpening\" draft. When the game begins, Bobbin is only able to play drafts using the notes C, D and E, limiting his ability to reproduce more powerful drafts. As the game progresses and additional notes become available, so his ability to play new drafts increases.\n\nThe game can be played at three difficulty levels, each differing in how clearly the notes being played are labeled. For example, the \"Standard\" level indicates the notes on a [[Scale (music)|scale]] below the distaff, while the \"Expert\" level shows no notes and must be played by ear. In the original release, expert players are rewarded with a cutscene that does not appear for the other two difficulties. The later [[CD-ROM]] release, however, shows an abridged version of this scene to all players.\n\n== Story ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\n{{quote|It was long after the passing of the second shadow, when dragons ruled the twilight sky, and the stars were bright and numerous ...|Clothos|Loom: The Audio Drama}}\n\nThe events of the game are preceded by a 30-minute audio drama. It is established that the Age of the Great Guilds arose when humans once again tried to establish dominion over nature. The world of \"Loom\" is not defined in relation to ours, but many hold that it happens on Earth in a greatly distant future, since the game takes place in the year 8021.\n\nPeople banded together to form city-states of a common trade \"devoted to the absolute control of knowledge, held together by stern traditions of pride, and of fear.\" The humble guild of Weavers established themselves as masters of woven fabric, though they eventually transcended the limits of cloth and began to weave \"subtle patterns of influence into the very fabric of reality.\" They were persecuted for these acts of \"witchcraft,\" and purchased an island far off the mainland coast, which they called Loom, after the great [[loom]] that was the symbol of their guild.\n\nLady Cygna Threadbare is introduced as a bereaved mother who begs the Elders of the Guild of Weavers to use the power of the Loom to end the suffering of the Weavers. Their numbers are failing and their seed is barren. The Elders Atropos, Clothos, and Lachesis, who are named after [[Greek mythology]]'s three [[Moirai|Fates]], reprimand Cygna, telling her that it is not their place to play gods.\n\nCygna, despite their warnings, secretly assumes control of the Loom and plants one gray thread. She inadvertently draws an (unforeseen) infant out of the Loom, incurring the wrath of the Elders. She surrenders the child to Dame Hetchel, the old serving woman, and accepts her fate. The Elders cast the \"[[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcendence]]\" draft on her, transforming her into a [[swan]] and banishing her from the pattern (the name ''Cygna'' is the feminine form of ''swan'' in [[Latin]]). Hetchel names the child Bobbin, and cares for him as her own.\n\nBobbin grows up ostracized from the rest of the Guild. The Elders note that the presence of his gray thread has thrown the pattern into chaos, and the Loom foresees the very unraveling of the pattern. For these reasons, the Elders ban him from learning the ways of the Guild until a decision can be made on Bobbin's seventeenth birthday (\"until his coming of age seventeen years hence,\" as it is described in the game's audio drama). Hetchel, however, defies the Elders and secretly teaches him a few basics of weaving. This is where the game begins.\n\n=== Plot ===\nOn his birthday, Bobbin is summoned by the Elders in order to determine his fate. He arrives at the Sanctuary in time to witness the Elders punish Hetchel with the \"Transcendence\" draft for educating Bobbin, but Hetchel reverts to a swan's egg, which puzzles and frightens the Elders. As they contemplate this turn of events a swan comes down from the sky and crashes through a window in the Sanctuary. She casts the \"Transcendence\" draft on the Elders, as well as the rest of the villagers, transforming all the Weavers except Bobbin into swans who leave through a rift in the sky. Bobbin, who is left all alone, finds Elder Atropos' distaff, and uses it to free Hetchel from her egg.\n\nHetchel, who is now a [[Swan|cygnet]], tells Bobbin that the swan who visits him every year on his birthday came to save the Weavers from the Third Shadow that is about to cover the world. Bobbin then moves on to find the flock. On his way, he meets other guilds and has several adventures. Eventually, he encounters a Cleric, Bishop Mandible, who is after the Scrying Sphere of the Glassmakers, the swords of the Blacksmiths, and the products of the Shepherds. Mandible claims the Weaver's distaff to rule the world with an army of the [[undead]], thus fulfilling the [[Prophecy|prophecies]]. By playing the draft of \"Opening\" on a nearby graveyard, he tears the fabric of the universe apart and allows an entity called \"Chaos\" to enter. Chaos kills Mandible and summons an army of undead to destroy the earth. Bobbin reclaims the distaff from the dead Bishop and heals many of the tears in the pattern, along the way helping many of his previous acquaintances, who were hurt or killed by Chaos's army. Finally, he battles Chaos, who is striving to take control of the great Loom on his native island. The battle ends as Chaos kills his stepmother using the  draft of \"Unmaking.\" It is hinted, however, that it is still possible to save Hetchel, as \"one feather still remained intact.\"\n\nBobbin then destroys the great Loom using the same draft. He is joined by his mother and the other Weavers and is told that one half of the world will be ruled by Chaos while the Weavers will stay in the other half, and that with time, they may gain enough power to challenge Chaos again. Bobbin casts \"Transcendence\" upon himself, and with the aid of his mother and the other villagers in their swan forms, he flies away, carrying the ripple across the world. His friends watch the flock of the swans fly away; it remains unclear whether Bobbin has left them in Chaos' realm or has saved them.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Music ===\nThe in-game music consists of excerpts from the ''[[Swan Lake]]'' ballet by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], arranged for [[MIDI]] by [[George Sanger (musician)|George \"The Fat Man\" Sanger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatman.com/compose.htm#Moriarty |title=Custom Sound Design: Testimonials by Game Industry leaders |website=The Fat Man |access-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518220524/http://fatman.com/compose.htm |archivedate=2015-05-18 }}</ref> While supporting basic PC speaker sound and [[AdLib]], the EGA version originally lacked built-in [[Roland MT-32]] support. A form included in the package could be mailed to Lucasfilm Games as an order for an extra game disk providing MT-32 support which was later also released as a downloadable patch. This disk also came with an additional overture which was played prior to the opening cutscene.\n\n=== Package contents ===\nThe original package offered an [[Compact Cassette|audio tape]] with a 30-minute [[audio drama]] that explained the nature and history of the world of ''Loom'', and the circumstances of Bobbin's birth. The game is a direct continuation of the story. The drama was enriched by original music composed by [[Jerry Gerber]].<ref>https://mocagh.org/lucasfilm/loom-tape-inlay.pdf</ref> Side A of the tape was encoded for standard Dolby-B playback;<ref>https://mocagh.org/lucasfilm/loom-tape.jpg</ref> side B was labelled \"game music\" and had a composition of the game's soundtrack.<ref>https://mocagh.org/lucasfilm/loom-tape-back.jpg</ref> In other releases of the game, side B had the identical program with side A{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} encoded for Dolby-S.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} It was the first commercial cassette to employ [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby-S noise reduction]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe package also offered an illustrated notebook, ''The Book of Patterns'', supposedly belonging to apprentice weavers in the game world. Its purpose was to optionally note there the drafts that could be learned, as well as describing some that were not seen in the game, with interesting tales related to each draft. Each description also included a staff and four spaces in which to record the four respective notes of the draft. The book contained a warning saying that wise spellweavers write in pencil; this is because many of the spells in the game have randomized threads (musical notes). In the original disk versions, it also acted as a form of copy protection; the game would ask players for the notes of a particular draft in the book at start-up.

But after it was finished, there was vague interest in continuing the story. In discussing this possibility, I imagined two sequels.\n\nThe first was tentatively called ''Forge''. It tells the story of Bobbin's friend Rusty Nailbender, whose home city (the Forge of the Blacksmiths) was enslaved by Chaos near the end of Loom. Rusty becomes the leader of an underground movement to overthrow Chaos, together with Fleece Firmflanks of the Shepherds and new characters from the other Guilds. Bobbin appears every now and then as a ghostly swan dispensing mystical advice, an obvious nod to Obi-Wan Kenobi of ''Star Wars''. The story climaxes in a terrible battle that nearly destroys the world.\n\nThe third game, ''The Fold'', is about Fleece Firmflanks and her attempt to unite the shattered Guilds in a final, desperate effort to banish Chaos. Near the end of the game, when the cause appears hopeless, Bobbin and the Weavers swoop in like the proverbial cavalry to save the day. The Loom of the Weavers is remade, reality is healed, and peace is restored to the Guilds.\n\nBut this was all just talk.

It was the fourth game to use the [[SCUMM]] adventure game engine, and the first of those to avoid the verb\u2013object interface introduced in ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nA departure from other [[LucasArts adventure games|Lucasfilm adventure games]] in many senses, ''Loom'' is based on a serious and complex [[fantasy]] story. With its experimental interface, it eschewed the traditional paradigm of graphical adventures, where puzzles usually involve interactions between the game character, the environment, and items the character has in their possession.\n\n''Loom''{{'s}} gameplay centers instead around magical four-note tunes known as \"drafts\" that the protagonist, Bobbin Threadbare, can play on his [[distaff]]. Each draft is a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] that has an effect of a certain type, such as \"Opening\" or \"Night Vision.\" Some drafts can be reversed by playing their notes backwards, so the \"Dye\" draft played backwards becomes \"Bleach,\" while others, such as the \"Terror\" draft, are [[palindrome]]s (e.g. C\u2013E\u2013E\u2013C) and so cannot be reversed in this manner.\n\n[[Image:Loom interface screenshot.png|thumb|right|An early scene from the game showing the distaff in the lower left and a selected object (the Great Loom) in the lower right.]]\n\nBobbin can learn drafts by observing an object that possesses the qualities of the desired draft; for example, by examining a blade while it is being sharpened, Bobbin can learn the \"Sharpening\" draft. When the game begins, Bobbin is only able to play drafts using the notes C, D and E, limiting his ability to reproduce more powerful drafts. As the game progresses and additional notes become available, so his ability to play new drafts increases.\n\nThe game can be played at three difficulty levels, each differing in how clearly the notes being played are labeled. For example, the \"Standard\" level indicates the notes on a [[Scale (music)|scale]] below the distaff, while the \"Expert\" level shows no notes and must be played by ear. In the original release, expert players are rewarded with a cutscene that does not appear for the other two difficulties. The later [[CD-ROM]] release, however, shows an abridged version of this scene to all players.\n\n== Story ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\n{{quote|It was long after the passing of the second shadow, when dragons ruled the twilight sky, and the stars were bright and numerous ...|Clothos|Loom: The Audio Drama}}\n\nThe events of the game are preceded by a 30-minute audio drama. It is established that the Age of the Great Guilds arose when humans once again tried to establish dominion over nature. The world of \"Loom\" is not defined in relation to ours, but many hold that it happens on Earth in a greatly distant future, since the game takes place in the year 8021.\n\nPeople banded together to form city-states of a common trade \"devoted to the absolute control of knowledge, held together by stern traditions of pride, and of fear.\" The humble guild of Weavers established themselves as masters of woven fabric, though they eventually transcended the limits of cloth and began to weave \"subtle patterns of influence into the very fabric of reality.\" They were persecuted for these acts of \"witchcraft,\" and purchased an island far off the mainland coast, which they called Loom, after the great [[loom]] that was the symbol of their guild.\n\nLady Cygna Threadbare is introduced as a bereaved mother who begs the Elders of the Guild of Weavers to use the power of the Loom to end the suffering of the Weavers. Their numbers are failing and their seed is barren. The Elders Atropos, Clothos, and Lachesis, who are named after [[Greek mythology]]'s three [[Moirai|Fates]], reprimand Cygna, telling her that it is not their place to play gods.\n\nCygna, despite their warnings, secretly assumes control of the Loom and plants one gray thread. She inadvertently draws an (unforeseen) infant out of the Loom, incurring the wrath of the Elders. She surrenders the child to Dame Hetchel, the old serving woman, and accepts her fate. The Elders cast the \"[[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcendence]]\" draft on her, transforming her into a [[swan]] and banishing her from the pattern (the name ''Cygna'' is the feminine form of ''swan'' in [[Latin]]). Hetchel names the child Bobbin, and cares for him as her own.\n\nBobbin grows up ostracized from the rest of the Guild. The Elders note that the presence of his gray thread has thrown the pattern into chaos, and the Loom foresees the very unraveling of the pattern. For these reasons, the Elders ban him from learning the ways of the Guild until a decision can be made on Bobbin's seventeenth birthday (\"until his coming of age seventeen years hence,\" as it is described in the game's audio drama). Hetchel, however, defies the Elders and secretly teaches him a few basics of weaving. This is where the game begins.\n\n=== Plot ===\nOn his birthday, Bobbin is summoned by the Elders in order to determine his fate. He arrives at the Sanctuary in time to witness the Elders punish Hetchel with the \"Transcendence\" draft for educating Bobbin, but Hetchel reverts to a swan's egg, which puzzles and frightens the Elders. As they contemplate this turn of events a swan comes down from the sky and crashes through a window in the Sanctuary. She casts the \"Transcendence\" draft on the Elders, as well as the rest of the villagers, transforming all the Weavers except Bobbin into swans who leave through a rift in the sky. Bobbin, who is left all alone, finds Elder Atropos' distaff, and uses it to free Hetchel from her egg.\n\nHetchel, who is now a [[Swan|cygnet]], tells Bobbin that the swan who visits him every year on his birthday came to save the Weavers from the Third Shadow that is about to cover the world. Bobbin then moves on to find the flock. On his way, he meets other guilds and has several adventures. Eventually, he encounters a Cleric, Bishop Mandible, who is after the Scrying Sphere of the Glassmakers, the swords of the Blacksmiths, and the products of the Shepherds. Mandible claims the Weaver's distaff to rule the world with an army of the [[undead]], thus fulfilling the [[Prophecy|prophecies]]. By playing the draft of \"Opening\" on a nearby graveyard, he tears the fabric of the universe apart and allows an entity called \"Chaos\" to enter. Chaos kills Mandible and summons an army of undead to destroy the earth. Bobbin reclaims the distaff from the dead Bishop and heals many of the tears in the pattern, along the way helping many of his previous acquaintances, who were hurt or killed by Chaos's army. Finally, he battles Chaos, who is striving to take control of the great Loom on his native island. The battle ends as Chaos kills his stepmother using the  draft of \"Unmaking.\" It is hinted, however, that it is still possible to save Hetchel, as \"one feather still remained intact.\"\n\nBobbin then destroys the great Loom using the same draft. He is joined by his mother and the other Weavers and is told that one half of the world will be ruled by Chaos while the Weavers will stay in the other half, and that with time, they may gain enough power to challenge Chaos again. Bobbin casts \"Transcendence\" upon himself, and with the aid of his mother and the other villagers in their swan forms, he flies away, carrying the ripple across the world. His friends watch the flock of the swans fly away; it remains unclear whether Bobbin has left them in Chaos' realm or has saved them.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Music ===\nThe in-game music consists of excerpts from the ''[[Swan Lake]]'' ballet by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], arranged for [[MIDI]] by [[George Sanger (musician)|George \"The Fat Man\" Sanger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatman.com/compose.htm#Moriarty |title=Custom Sound Design: Testimonials by Game Industry leaders |website=The Fat Man |access-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518220524/http://fatman.com/compose.htm |archivedate=2015-05-18 }}</ref> While supporting basic PC speaker sound and [[AdLib]], the EGA version originally lacked built-in [[Roland MT-32]] support. A form included in the package could be mailed to Lucasfilm Games as an order for an extra game disk providing MT-32 support which was later also released as a downloadable patch. This disk also came with an additional overture which was played prior to the opening cutscene.\n\n=== Package contents ===\nThe original package offered an [[Compact Cassette|audio tape]] with a 30-minute [[audio drama]] that explained the nature and history of the world of ''Loom'', and the circumstances of Bobbin's birth. The game is a direct continuation of the story. The drama was enriched by original music composed by [[Jerry Gerber]].<ref>https://mocagh.org/lucasfilm/loom-tape-inlay.pdf</ref> Side A of the tape was encoded for standard Dolby-B playback;<ref>https://mocagh.org/lucasfilm/loom-tape.jpg</ref> side B was labelled \"game music\" and had a composition of the game's soundtrack.<ref>https://mocagh.org/lucasfilm/loom-tape-back.jpg</ref> In other releases of the game, side B had the identical program with side A{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} encoded for Dolby-S.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} It was the first commercial cassette to employ [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby-S noise reduction]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe package also offered an illustrated notebook, ''The Book of Patterns'', supposedly belonging to apprentice weavers in the game world. Its purpose was to optionally note there the drafts that could be learned, as well as describing some that were not seen in the game, with interesting tales related to each draft. Each description also included a staff and four spaces in which to record the four respective notes of the draft. The book contained a warning saying that wise spellweavers write in pencil; this is because many of the spells in the game have randomized threads (musical notes). In the original disk versions, it also acted as a form of copy protection; the game would ask players for the notes of a particular draft in the book at start-up. If the player doesn't enter the correct notes, the game would exit back to the operating system (in the PC version, it would enter demo mode).\n\n=== Orson Scott Card ===\nA common misconception about ''Loom'' is that author [[Orson Scott Card]] contributed to its original development, based on his name appearing in the credits. Card mentions in a review for ''Loom'' that this is untrue, and that Moriarty included his name in the credits due to some very minor feedback he had provided prior to the game's release.<ref>{{Citation|last=Card |first=Orson Scott |author-link=Orson Scott Card |title=Books to Look For |periodical=[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]] |date=December 1990 |url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/f&sf/90-12.html |access-date=2015-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425134516/http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/f%26sf/90-12.html |archivedate=2015-04-25 }}</ref> Card's association with Lucasfilm continued, however, leading to more significant contributions to ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'', ''Loom''{{'s}} 1992 \"talkie\" release,<ref name=\"gdc-postmortem\" /> and ''[[The Dig (video game)|The Dig]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"bminterview\" />\n\n== Release history ==\n''Loom'' was originally published for [[DOS]] on [[floppy disk]] with 16-color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics in May 1990.<ref name=\"the-one-review\">{{cite news|last=Presley |first=Paul |date=May 1990 |title=Loom |url=http://amr.abime.net/review_38895 |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |place=United Kingdom |issue=20 |pages=33\u201335 |access-date=2015-09-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927102327/http://amr.abime.net/review_38895 |archivedate=2015-09-27 }}</ref><ref name=\"gdc-postmortem\" /> This version was soon after released on the [[Amiga]], the [[Atari ST]], and [[Macintosh]].\n\n=== FM Towns ===\n''Loom'' was redeveloped for the Japanese [[FM Towns]] computer and released on [[CD-ROM]] in 1991 with enhanced 256-color [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] graphics and a new digital soundtrack.

But after it was finished, there was vague interest in continuing the story. In discussing this possibility, I imagined two sequels.\n\nThe first was tentatively called ''Forge''. It tells the story of Bobbin's friend Rusty Nailbender, whose home city (the Forge of the Blacksmiths) was enslaved by Chaos near the end of Loom. Rusty becomes the leader of an underground movement to overthrow Chaos, together with Fleece Firmflanks of the Shepherds and new characters from the other Guilds. Bobbin appears every now and then as a ghostly swan dispensing mystical advice, an obvious nod to Obi-Wan Kenobi of ''Star Wars''. The story climaxes in a terrible battle that nearly destroys the world.\n\nThe third game, ''The Fold'', is about Fleece Firmflanks and her attempt to unite the shattered Guilds in a final, desperate effort to banish Chaos. Near the end of the game, when the cause appears hopeless, Bobbin and the Weavers swoop in like the proverbial cavalry to save the day. The Loom of the Weavers is remade, reality is healed, and peace is restored to the Guilds.\n\nBut this was all just talk.

''[[The Economist]]'' described effective programming for the Nintendo 64 as being \"horrendously complex\".<ref>\"Nintendo Wakes Up.\" The Economist August 3, 1996: 55-. ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. May 24, 2012.</ref> As with many other game consoles and other types of embedded systems, the Nintendo 64's architectural optimizations are uniquely acute, due to a combination of oversight on the part of the hardware designers, limitations on 3D technology of the time, and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAs the Nintendo 64 reached the end of its lifecycle, hardware development chief [[Genyo Takeda]] repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word ''hansei'' ({{lang-ja|\u53cd\u7701}} \"reflective regret\"). Looking back, Takeda said \"When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical that if you want to make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong. We now understand it's the cruising speed that matters, not the momentary flash of peak power\".<ref name=\"It's Hip to be Square\">{{cite journal | magazine=Newsweek | title=It's Hip to be Square | last1=Croal | first1=N'Gai | last2=Kawaguchi | first2=Masato | last3=Saltzman | first3=Marc | volume=136 | issue=10 | date=September 3, 2000 | page=53 | url=http://www.newsweek.com/its-hip-be-square-159157 | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Regional lockout ===\nNintendo initially stated that while the Nintendo 64 units for each region use essentially identical hardware design, [[regional lockout]] chips would prevent games from one region from being played on a Nintendo 64 console from a different region.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=N64 Top 10 List |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |page=17}}</ref> Following the North American launch, however, they admitted that the cartridges contain no such chips, and the regional lockout is enforced by differing notches in the back of the cartridges.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Launch Puts N64 on Map |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1996 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref>\n\n== Games ==\n{{See also|List of Nintendo 64 games|Nintendo Selects#Nintendo 64|l2=List of Nintendo 64 Player's Choice games}}\n\nA total of 388 games were released for the console, though there were a few that were exclusively sold in Japan. For comparison, rivals [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and the [[Sega Saturn]] received around 1,100 games and 600 games respectively, while previous Nintendo consoles such as the  NES and SNES had 768 and 725 games released in the United States.

In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had to create their own custom microcode.  Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system.  The Nintendo 64's graphics chip is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors.  It is the first home console to feature [[trilinear filtering]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo DS vs. Nintendo 64 |url=http://purenintendo.com/2008/12/26/nintendo-ds-vs-nintendo-64so-whats-more-powerful/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> which allowed textures to look very smooth. This contrasted with the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which used [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Game Tutorial |url=http://www.rockin-b.de/saturn/saturngametutorial/SaturnGameTutorial.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> and produced more [[Pixelation|pixelated]] textures.  Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.\n\nThe smaller storage size of ROM cartridges limited the number of available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12&nbsp;MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces.  Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo 64 |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1242&st=2 |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> of on-chip texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64&nbsp;MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', ''[[Sin and Punishment]]: Successor of the Earth'', and ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' as they feature more ROM space,<ref name=\"hardware1\" /> allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.\n\n=== Game Paks ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}\n[[File:N64-Game-Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Open and unopened Nintendo 64 Game Paks]]\n\nNintendo 64 games are [[ROM cartridge]] based.

Its vintage [[ROM cartridge]]s are constrained by small capacity and high production expenses, compared to the [[compact disc]] format used by its chief competitors. Some third-party publishers that supported Nintendo's previous consoles reduced their output or stopped publishing for the console; the Nintendo 64's most successful games came from [[Video game developer|first-party or second-party studios]].\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{See also|Virtual Console|List of video game emulators#Nintendo 64|label 2=List of Nintendo 64 console emulators}}\n\nSeveral Nintendo 64 games have been released for the [[Wii]]'s and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service and are playable with the [[Classic Controller]], [[GameCube controller]], [[Wii U Pro Controller]], or [[Wii U GamePad]]. There are some differences between these versions and the original cartridge versions. For example, the games run in a higher resolution and at a more consistent framerate than their Nintendo 64 counterparts. Some features, such as Rumble Pak functionality, are not available in the Wii versions. Some features are also changed on the Virtual Console releases. For example, the VC version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allows players to send photos through the Wii's message service, while ''[[Wave Race 64]]'''s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, including ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', following Microsoft's acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game.\n\nSeveral unofficial emulators have been developed in order to play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and cell phones.\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 accessories}}\n\nA number of accessories were produced for the Nintendo 64, including the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.\n\nThe controller was shaped like an \"M\", employing a joystick in the center. ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' called its shape \"evocative of some alien space ship\". While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said \"the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types\".<ref name=\"Popular Will\" />\n\n=== 64DD ===\n{{Anchor|Disk drive}}\n{{Main|64DD}}\nNintendo released a peripheral platform called [[64DD]], where \"DD\" stands for \"Disk Drive\". Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese [[Randnet]] online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four ''[[Mario Artist]]'' games (''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', ''Communication Kit'', and ''Polygon Studio''). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, though always having been announced for America and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] said: \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to come up with if we didn\u2019t have the 64DD\". [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] concluded: \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we\u2019ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we\u2019ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game\".<ref name=\"The 64Dream Dec 1997\">{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the \"Big 2\" | others=[http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ Translation] | magazine=The 64DREAM | subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical reception===\nThe Nintendo 64 received generally positive reviews from critics.

Its form factor was described as small, light, and \"built for heavy play by kids\" unlike the \"relatively fragile Sega Saturn\". Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was \"worth the wait\" in the company's pursuit of quality.  Nintendo's \"penchant for perfection\" in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the ''Times'' cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \"place a premium on substance over flash\", and noted that the launch titles lack the \"poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures\" which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo's controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its \"nonexistent\" load times and \"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\", the review concluded that \"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish\".<ref name=\"Curtiss wonder\">{{cite news | last=Curtiss | first=Aaron | title=New Nintendo 64 is a Technical Wonder; Leisure: The Cartridge-Based Game Machine Boasts Blistering Speed and Super-Sharp Graphics | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/business/fi-49002_1_n64 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 30, 1996 | accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' named it their 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had \"done to video-gaming what the [[Boeing 707|707]] did to air travel\".

ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. May 24, 2012.</ref> As with many other game consoles and other types of embedded systems, the Nintendo 64's architectural optimizations are uniquely acute, due to a combination of oversight on the part of the hardware designers, limitations on 3D technology of the time, and manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAs the Nintendo 64 reached the end of its lifecycle, hardware development chief [[Genyo Takeda]] repeatedly referred to the programming challenges using the word ''hansei'' ({{lang-ja|\u53cd\u7701}} \"reflective regret\"). Looking back, Takeda said \"When we made Nintendo 64, we thought it was logical that if you want to make advanced games, it becomes technically more difficult. We were wrong.

In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had to create their own custom microcode.  Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system.  The Nintendo 64's graphics chip is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors.  It is the first home console to feature [[trilinear filtering]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo DS vs. Nintendo 64 |url=http://purenintendo.com/2008/12/26/nintendo-ds-vs-nintendo-64so-whats-more-powerful/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> which allowed textures to look very smooth. This contrasted with the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which used [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Game Tutorial |url=http://www.rockin-b.de/saturn/saturngametutorial/SaturnGameTutorial.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> and produced more [[Pixelation|pixelated]] textures.  Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.\n\nThe smaller storage size of ROM cartridges limited the number of available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12&nbsp;MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces.  Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo 64 |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1242&st=2 |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> of on-chip texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64&nbsp;MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', ''[[Sin and Punishment]]: Successor of the Earth'', and ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' as they feature more ROM space,<ref name=\"hardware1\" /> allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.\n\n=== Game Paks ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}\n[[File:N64-Game-Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Open and unopened Nintendo 64 Game Paks]]\n\nNintendo 64 games are [[ROM cartridge]] based.

For example, the VC version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allows players to send photos through the Wii's message service, while ''[[Wave Race 64]]'''s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, including ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', following Microsoft's acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game.\n\nSeveral unofficial emulators have been developed in order to play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and cell phones.\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 accessories}}\n\nA number of accessories were produced for the Nintendo 64, including the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.\n\nThe controller was shaped like an \"M\", employing a joystick in the center. ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' called its shape \"evocative of some alien space ship\". While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said \"the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types\".<ref name=\"Popular Will\" />\n\n=== 64DD ===\n{{Anchor|Disk drive}}\n{{Main|64DD}}\nNintendo released a peripheral platform called [[64DD]], where \"DD\" stands for \"Disk Drive\". Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese [[Randnet]] online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four ''[[Mario Artist]]'' games (''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', ''Communication Kit'', and ''Polygon Studio''). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, though always having been announced for America and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] said: \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to come up with if we didn\u2019t have the 64DD\". [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] concluded: \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we\u2019ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we\u2019ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game\".<ref name=\"The 64Dream Dec 1997\">{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the \"Big 2\" | others=[http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ Translation] | magazine=The 64DREAM | subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical reception===\nThe Nintendo 64 received generally positive reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the console's advanced 3D graphics and gameplay, while criticizing the lack of games, especially compared to its rival, the PlayStation. On [[G4techTV]]'s ''[[Filter (TV series)|Filter]]'', the Nintendo 64 was voted up to No. 1 by registered users.\n\nIn February 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' magazine called the Nintendo Ultra 64 the \"best kept secret in videogames\" and the \"world's most powerful game machine\". It called the system's November 24, 1995 unveiling at [[Nintendo Space World|Shoshinkai]] \"the most anticipated videogaming event of the 1990s, possibly of all time\".<ref name=\"NextGen 14\">{{cite journal | magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] | date=February 1996 | issue=14 | title=Ultra 64: Nintendo's shot at the title | url=https://archive.org/stream/nextgen-issue-014/Next_Generation_Issue_014_February_1996 | accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref> Previewing the Nintendo 64 shortly prior to its launch, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine praised the realistic movement and gameplay provided by the combination of fast graphics processing, pressure-sensitive controller, and the ''Super Mario 64'' game.

Its form factor was described as small, light, and \"built for heavy play by kids\" unlike the \"relatively fragile Sega Saturn\". Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was \"worth the wait\" in the company's pursuit of quality.  Nintendo's \"penchant for perfection\" in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the ''Times'' cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \"place a premium on substance over flash\", and noted that the launch titles lack the \"poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures\" which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo's controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its \"nonexistent\" load times and \"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\", the review concluded that \"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish\".<ref name=\"Curtiss wonder\">{{cite news | last=Curtiss | first=Aaron | title=New Nintendo 64 is a Technical Wonder; Leisure: The Cartridge-Based Game Machine Boasts Blistering Speed and Super-Sharp Graphics | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/business/fi-49002_1_n64 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 30, 1996 | accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' named it their 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had \"done to video-gaming what the [[Boeing 707|707]] did to air travel\".

''Time'' credited the Nintendo 64 with revitalizing the video game market, \"rescuing this industry from the dustbin of entertainment history\". The magazine suggested that the Nintendo 64 would play a major role in introducing children to digital technology in the final years of the 20th century.
