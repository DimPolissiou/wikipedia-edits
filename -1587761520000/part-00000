The tank is a modern variation of the [[T-72|T-72B]] and incorporates many features found on the [[T-80|T-80U]]. Originally called the T-72BU, but later renamed to T-90, it is an advanced tank in service with [[Russian Ground Forces]] and the [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Naval Infantry]]. The T-90 uses a 125{{nbsp}}mm [[2A46]] smoothbore [[tank gun|main gun]], the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded engine, and gunner's [[thermal sight]]. Standard protective measures include a blend of steel and [[composite armour]], smoke grenade dischargers, [[Kontakt-5]] [[Explosive reactive armour|explosive-reactive armour]] and the [[Shtora]] infrared [[ATGM]] jamming system. It was designed and built by [[Uralvagonzavod]], in [[Nizhny Tagil]], Russia.\n==Development==\nThe T-90 has its origins in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era program aimed at developing a single replacement for the [[T-64]], T-72 and T-80 series of main battle tanks. The T-72 platform was selected as the basis for the new generation of tank owing to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and automotive qualities. The Kartsev-Venediktov Design Bureau from Nizhny Tagil was responsible for the design work and prepared two parallel proposals\u2014the ''Object 188'', which was a relatively simple upgrade of the existing T-72B tank (''Object 184''), and the far more advanced ''[[Object 187]]''\u2014only vaguely related to the T-72 series and incorporating major improvements to the hull and turret design, armor, powerplant and armament. Development work was approved in 1986 and the first prototypes were completed by 1988. The vehicles resulting from the ''Object 187'' program have not been declassified to this date, but it was the lower risk ''Object 188'' upgrade that would be approved for series production as the '''T-72BU'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Szulc|first1=Tomasz|title=Ostatnie czo\u0142gi Zwi\u0105zku Radzieckiego?|journal=Nowa Technika Wojskowa|date=August 2009|issue=9|pages=24\u201330}}</ref>\n\n==Production and service history==\n[[File:T-90 snorkel.jpg|thumb|left|An early series T-90 with cast turret during a military exercise in Russia, demonstrating deep fording.]]\n\nThe [[T-72]]BU was officially accepted into service on 5 October 1992 by the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Defence]] and simultaneously renamed as the T-90 for marketing and propaganda purposes aimed at distancing the new type from existing [[T-72]] variants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Szulc|first1=Tomasz|title=Nowe Czo\u0142gi Naszych Wschodnich S\u0105siad\u00f3w: T-90MS I Op\u0142ot-M|journal=Nowa Technika Wojskowa|date=September 2012|issue=9|pages=12\u201324}}</ref>\n\nThe principal upgrade in the T-90 is the incorporation of a slightly modified form of the [[T-80]]U's more sophisticated 1A45T ''Irtysh'' fire control system and an upgraded V-84MS multi-fuel engine developing 830&nbsp;hp (620&nbsp;kW). The T-90 was manufactured at the [[Uralvagonzavod]] factory in Nizhny Tagil, with low-level production being carried out since 1993 and virtually ceasing towards the end of the 1990s for the native market.

India signaled interest in the T-90 in response to Pakistan's acquisition of 320 Ukrainian [[T-84]] tanks, which was an intuitive decision considering India held rights to fully manufacture the T-72M1 in [[Avadi]], with production being easily adapted to assemble the T-90.\n\nThe first 42 complete Indian tanks were delivered in 2001 and were designated '''T-90S''' ('''''Object 188S'''''), still equipped with the older cast turrets of the early series (this exhausted the remaining stocks of cast turrets warehoused at Nizhny Tagil) and powered by the V-84 engine making 840&nbsp;hp (618&nbsp;kW). This was followed up next year with delivery of 82 vehicles, now equipped with the new welded turrets and the V-92S2 engine, generating 1,000&nbsp;hp (735&nbsp;kW). The initial contract stipulated the following batch of 186 tanks\u2014now officially called the '''Bhishma'''\u2014to be completed in India from Russian-supplied kits, and then gradually replaced with domestically manufactured parts, but the low rate of domestic Indian production compelled the Indian authorities to place an additional order for 124 complete vehicles in 2007 from Uralvagonzavod.\n\n[[File:T-90A - Engineering Technologies 2012 -01.jpg|thumb|A Russian specification T-90A.

But with the new order numbering a paltry 14 tanks, and the large capital investment required to set up production of new cast turrets, the Russian Ministry of Defence agreed on a new configuration very close to the Indian T-90S, which was expeditiously accepted into service without any trials as the '''''Object 188A1''''' or '''T-90A'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Szulc|first1=Tomasz|title=Nowe Czo\u0142gi Naszych Wschodnich S\u0105siad\u00f3w: T-90MS I Op\u0142ot-M|journal=Nowa Technika Wojskowa|date=September 2012|issue=9|pages=14}}</ref> That same year saw delivery of an additional 18 new tanks - enough to equip approximately five tank platoons.

ERA bricks are also located on the turret roof and provide protection from top-attack weapons. The turret's forward armour package, in addition to the ERA and steel plating, contains a composite filler of Russian composite armour sandwiched between upper and lower steel plates.

This system includes two electro-optical/IR \"[[Dazzler (weapon)|dazzlers]]\" (i.e. [[Infrared countermeasure|active infrared]] jammer) on the front of the turret (which gives the distinctive \"Red Eyes\"), four [[laser warning receiver]]s, two 3D6 [[smoke grenade|'smoke' grenade]] [[Grenade launcher|discharging systems]] and a computerised control system. The Shtora-1 warns the tank's crew when the tank has been '[[Laser designator|painted]]' by a [[laser guidance|weapon-guidance laser]] and allows the crew to slew the turret to face the threat. The infrared jammer, the TShU1-7 EOCMDAS, jams the semiautomatic command to line of sight ([[SACLOS]]) guidance system used by some [[anti-tank guided missile]]s. The smoke grenades are automatically launched after Shtora detects that it has been painted. The smoke grenades are used to mask the tank from laser rangefinders and designators as well as the optics of other weapons systems.

-->]</ref> is a [[List of main battle tanks by generation#Third generation|third-generation]] Russian [[main battle tank|battle tank]] that entered service in 1993. The tank is a modern variation of the [[T-72|T-72B]] and incorporates many features found on the [[T-80|T-80U]]. Originally called the T-72BU, but later renamed to T-90, it is an advanced tank in service with [[Russian Ground Forces]] and the [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Naval Infantry]]. The T-90 uses a 125{{nbsp}}mm [[2A46]] smoothbore [[tank gun|main gun]], the 1A45T fire-control system, an upgraded engine, and gunner's [[thermal sight]]. Standard protective measures include a blend of steel and [[composite armour]], smoke grenade dischargers, [[Kontakt-5]] [[Explosive reactive armour|explosive-reactive armour]] and the [[Shtora]] infrared [[ATGM]] jamming system. It was designed and built by [[Uralvagonzavod]], in [[Nizhny Tagil]], Russia.\n==Development==\nThe T-90 has its origins in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era program aimed at developing a single replacement for the [[T-64]], T-72 and T-80 series of main battle tanks. The T-72 platform was selected as the basis for the new generation of tank owing to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and automotive qualities. The Kartsev-Venediktov Design Bureau from Nizhny Tagil was responsible for the design work and prepared two parallel proposals\u2014the ''Object 188'', which was a relatively simple upgrade of the existing T-72B tank (''Object 184''), and the far more advanced ''[[Object 187]]''\u2014only vaguely related to the T-72 series and incorporating major improvements to the hull and turret design, armor, powerplant and armament.

India signaled interest in the T-90 in response to Pakistan's acquisition of 320 Ukrainian [[T-84]] tanks, which was an intuitive decision considering India held rights to fully manufacture the T-72M1 in [[Avadi]], with production being easily adapted to assemble the T-90.\n\nThe first 42 complete Indian tanks were delivered in 2001 and were designated '''T-90S''' ('''''Object 188S'''''), still equipped with the older cast turrets of the early series (this exhausted the remaining stocks of cast turrets warehoused at Nizhny Tagil) and powered by the V-84 engine making 840&nbsp;hp (618&nbsp;kW). This was followed up next year with delivery of 82 vehicles, now equipped with the new welded turrets and the V-92S2 engine, generating 1,000&nbsp;hp (735&nbsp;kW).

ERA bricks are also located on the turret roof and provide protection from top-attack weapons. The turret's forward armour package, in addition to the ERA and steel plating, contains a composite filler of Russian composite armour sandwiched between upper and lower steel plates.

This system includes two electro-optical/IR \"[[Dazzler (weapon)|dazzlers]]\" (i.e. [[Infrared countermeasure|active infrared]] jammer) on the front of the turret (which gives the distinctive \"Red Eyes\"), four [[laser warning receiver]]s, two 3D6 [[smoke grenade|'smoke' grenade]] [[Grenade launcher|discharging systems]] and a computerised control system. The Shtora-1 warns the tank's crew when the tank has been '[[Laser designator|painted]]' by a [[laser guidance|weapon-guidance laser]] and allows the crew to slew the turret to face the threat. The infrared jammer, the TShU1-7 EOCMDAS, jams the semiautomatic command to line of sight ([[SACLOS]]) guidance system used by some [[anti-tank guided missile]]s. The smoke grenades are automatically launched after Shtora detects that it has been painted. The smoke grenades are used to mask the tank from laser rangefinders and designators as well as the optics of other weapons systems.

This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|playoff game]] between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to [[Chicago Stadium]], which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9\u20130 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the ''de facto'' championship game led the NFL, beginning in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], to split into [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u201369|two divisions]] with a championship game to be played between the division champions.<ref name=\"The 60-Yard Circus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929180027/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2010|title=The 60-Yard Circus|last=Carroll|first=Bob|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> The [[1934 NFL season|1934 season]] also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were [[Black players in professional American football|absent from the league]].

Rival leagues included at least three separate [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]] and the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the [[Los Angeles Rams]] (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the last two of which came from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional [[Canadian football]] circuit, which formally became the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|a different football code]] than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.\n\nA new professional league, the fourth [[American Football League]] (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the [[Super Bowl]], was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], and the AFL winning [[Super Bowl III]] and [[Super Bowl IV]].<ref name=\"Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger\">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215044251/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 15, 2001 |title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger |last=Cross |first=B.

After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in [[1946 NFL season|1946]] and to 12 in 1947.

If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the conference champion. In [[1967 NFL season|1967]], the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion [[New Orleans Saints]] to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions.

This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|playoff game]] between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to [[Chicago Stadium]], which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9\u20130 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the ''de facto'' championship game led the NFL, beginning in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], to split into [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u201369|two divisions]] with a championship game to be played between the division champions.<ref name=\"The 60-Yard Circus\">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929180027/http://profootballresearchers.org/Articles/1932%20Season.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 29, 2010|title=The 60-Yard Circus|last=Carroll|first=Bob|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=February 9, 2013}}</ref> The [[1934 NFL season|1934 season]] also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were [[Black players in professional American football|absent from the league]].

Rival leagues included at least three separate [[American Football League (disambiguation)|American Football Leagues]] and the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the [[Los Angeles Rams]] (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the last two of which came from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional [[Canadian football]] circuit, which formally became the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|a different football code]] than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.\n\nA new professional league, the fourth [[American Football League]] (AFL), began play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the [[Super Bowl]], was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], and the AFL winning [[Super Bowl III]] and [[Super Bowl IV]].<ref name=\"Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger\">{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215044251/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 15, 2001 |title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger |last=Cross |first=B.

After the war ended, the number of games returned to 11 games in [[1946 NFL season|1946]] and to 12 in 1947.

If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the conference champion. In [[1967 NFL season|1967]], the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion [[New Orleans Saints]] to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions.
