The trail starts with a trip on a raft across the lagoon and runs through [[fynbos]] and subtropical vegetation.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Jeffreys Bay beach view.jpg|Jeffreys Bay beach view\nFile:Villa African Queen - Jeffreys Bay Beach View.jpg|Jeffreys Bay beach view from the top of the Villa African Queen\nFile:JBay-Surfing at supertubes-001.jpg|Surfing at Supertubes\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Surfing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Jeffreys Bay}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Jeffreys Bay}}\n* [http://www.jeffreysbaytourism.org/ Official tourism site]\n\n{{Sarah Baartman District Municipality}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1849]]\n[[Category:Populated places in the Kouga Local Municipality]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Tourism in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Surfing locations in South Africa]]\n[[Category:1849 establishments in the Cape Colony]]\n", "name_user": "Richaldito", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_Bay"}

Many of the first anarchists in Belarus were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"generality\" of existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. They demanded the destruction of the [[State (polity)|state]], which included not only the [[monarchy]], but also the [[parliamentary republic]]; these were both deemed a tool of [[class oppression]]. For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kriya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe most decisive tactics used by these anarchists were [[expropriation]] and the incitation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around them. Though workers from [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bialystok]] joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale, the anarchists could not move beyond local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nThe leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] in 1917 were born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus - Joseph Blakeman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon Lenin's party will even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and Esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks\"...\n\nIf in the central part of Russia this union was soon broken up, in German-occupied Belarus, the united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions - on the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party - on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus.

However, in the 60-70s in Minsk, [[Gomel]] and other cities there were \"hippies,\" which can be referred to as anarchist subculture with a certain degree of tension. However, there were no organizations in this case.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it.\n\nIn summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th, 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhong\" also started its activity, which played a significant role in the development of the anarchist movement in Belarus.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the happening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhong, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists, an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Many of the first anarchists in Belarus were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"generality\" of existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. They demanded the destruction of the [[State (polity)|state]], which included not only the [[monarchy]], but also the [[parliamentary republic]]; these were both deemed a tool of [[class oppression]]. For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kratiya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe most decisive tactics used by these anarchists were [[expropriation]] and the incitation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around them. Though workers from [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bialystok]] joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale, the anarchists could not move beyond local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nThe leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] in 1917 were born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus - Joseph Blakhman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon Lenin's party will even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But in order to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks\"..\n\nIf in the central part of Russia this union was soon broken up, in German-occupied Belarus, the united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions - on the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party - on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus. Soon, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, were finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies.

Abrams is a sought after speaker on sexual assault, domestic violence, race, and depictions of women of color in the media and has spoken at over three-hundred organizations and universities around the United States.<ref>https://womenscenter.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/552/2015/02/dec_2014.pdf</ref><ref>https://speakeasyohiou.com/2015/04/17/sil-lai-abrams-shares-sexual-assault-story-offers-support-at-take-back-the-night-rally/</ref><ref>https://volink.utk.edu/event/428452</ref> She regularly provides television commentary on gender violence<ref>https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/02/09/exp-sil-lai-abrams-9a-segment.cnn</ref><ref>https://www.msnbc.com/the-reid-report/watch/nfl-appoints-all-woman-panel-to-oversee-policy-329968707546</ref><ref>https://video.foxnews.com/v/6097188187001#sp=show-clips</ref>  and has been profiled in numerous magazines, including ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[EBONY]]'', ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Modern Woman]]'', and ''ESSENCE''. [[The Root]] praised Abrams for her use of \u201csocial media to protest the narrative that Black women\u2019s realities can be defined by dysfunctional entertainment\u201d, and she has served on the Board of Directors for two of the nation\u2019s largest victim services nonprofit organizations, [[Safe Horizon]] and the [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]]. \n\nAbrams is a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence, which prompted her to begin volunteering in domestic violence shelters beginning in the mid-2000s. Since 2007, her work has been primarily focused on gender violence awareness and prevention in the Black community. \n\n===Early life===\nAbrams was born in Maui, Hawaii. The father listed on her birth certificate is a white former U.S. Army serviceman and her biological mother is a Hong Konger of Han Chinese descent. At age 14, Abrams learned that the man she called her father was not biologically related to her and that her natural father was a Black Air America pilot.<ref>Sil Lai Abrams. (n.d.).

Following her modeling career, Abrams began working in the entertainment event planning and marketing industry. She often paired celebrities with causes but found herself increasingly interested in working directly with survivors of gender violence.  This inspired Abrams to begin volunteering in domestic violence shelters. Eventually, Abrams' volunteerism spurred her to become a full-time activist and advocate.\n\n===Writing Career===\n\nIn 2007, Abrams published her first book, the self-help tome \"No More Drama: Nine Simple Steps to Transforming a Breakdown into a Breakthrough\", which describes how one can transform personal breakdowns into breakthroughs. In 2016, her second book entitled ''Black Lotus: A Woman's Search for Racial Identity'' was published by [[Gallery Books]]/Karen Hunter Publishing. The memoir recounted Abrams\u2019 journey to discover and embrace herself in a family that sought to deny her Black heritage. ''Black Lotus'' was selected by [[NPR]] as one of their 2016 books of the year, and praised as a \u201csearingly honest coming-of-age memoir\u201d by ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sil-lai-abrams/black-lotus-womans-search/</ref> and a \u201cpage-turning\u201d book that \u201cmemoir fans will devour\u201d by ''[[Library Journal]]''.<ref>https://www.libraryjournal.com/?reviewDetail=black-lotus-a-womans-search-for-racial-identity</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'' stated \u201cHer pain pulses on the page, and at the core of her unfolding is an undying hope that the truth of all that she is will be loved and accepted.

Abrams is a sought after speaker on sexual assault, domestic violence, race, and depictions of women of color in the media and has spoken at over three-hundred organizations and universities around the United States.<ref>https://womenscenter.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/552/2015/02/dec_2014.pdf</ref><ref>https://speakeasyohiou.com/2015/04/17/sil-lai-abrams-shares-sexual-assault-story-offers-support-at-take-back-the-night-rally/</ref><ref>https://volink.utk.edu/event/428452</ref> She regularly provides television commentary on gender violence<ref>https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2015/02/09/exp-sil-lai-abrams-9a-segment.cnn</ref><ref>https://www.msnbc.com/the-reid-report/watch/nfl-appoints-all-woman-panel-to-oversee-policy-329968707546</ref><ref>https://video.foxnews.com/v/6097188187001#sp=show-clips</ref>  and has been profiled in numerous magazines, including ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', ''[[EBONY]]'', ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Modern Woman]]'', and ''ESSENCE''. [[The Root]] praised Abrams for her use of \u201csocial media to protest the narrative that Black women\u2019s realities can be defined by dysfunctional entertainment\u201d, and she has served on the Board of Directors for two of the nation\u2019s largest victim services nonprofit organizations, [[Safe Horizon]] and the [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]]. \n\nAbrams is a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence, which prompted her to begin volunteering in domestic violence shelters beginning in the mid-2000s. Since 2007, her work has been primarily focused on gender violence awareness and prevention in the Black community. \n\n===Early life===\nAbrams was born in Maui, Hawaii. The father listed on her birth certificate is a white former U.S. Army serviceman and her biological mother is a Hong Konger of Han Chinese descent. At age 14, Abrams learned that the man she called her father was not biologically related to her and that her natural father was a Black Air America pilot.<ref>Sil Lai Abrams. (n.d.).

Following her modeling career, Abrams began working in the entertainment event planning and marketing industry. She often paired celebrities with causes but found herself increasingly interested in working directly with survivors of gender violence.  This inspired Abrams to begin volunteering in domestic violence shelters. Eventually, Abrams' volunteerism spurred her to become a full-time activist and advocate.\n\n===Writing Career===\n\nIn 2007, Abrams published her first book, the self-help tome \"No More Drama: Nine Simple Steps to Transforming a Breakdown into a Breakthrough\", which describes how one can transform personal breakdowns into breakthroughs. In 2016, her second book entitled ''Black Lotus: A Woman's Search for Racial Identity'' was published by [[Gallery Books]]/Karen Hunter Publishing. The memoir recounted Abrams\u2019 journey to discover and embrace herself in a family that sought to deny her Black heritage. ''Black Lotus'' was selected by [[NPR]] as one of their 2016 books of the year, and praised as a \u201csearingly honest coming-of-age memoir\u201d by ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sil-lai-abrams/black-lotus-womans-search/</ref> and a \u201cpage-turning\u201d book that \u201cmemoir fans will devour\u201d by ''[[Library Journal]]''.<ref>https://www.libraryjournal.com/?reviewDetail=black-lotus-a-womans-search-for-racial-identity</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'' stated \u201cHer pain pulses on the page, and at the core of her unfolding is an undying hope that the truth of all that she is will be loved and accepted. If that is Abrams\u2019s goal, then ''Black Lotus'' is a triumph.\u201d<ref>https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/sil-lai-abrams-blooms-in-blackness/</ref> The [[Wellesley Centers for Women]]\u2019s ''Women\u2019s Review of Books'' said: \u201cAbrams ultimately finds a way to claim and hold onto her own sacredness and encourage others to embark on the journey that leads them to embrace their own.\u201d<ref>https://www.wcwonline.org/WRB-Issues/womens-review-of-books-2017</ref>\n\nAbrams, is the former relationship expert for EBONY.com and ''Men\u2019s Fitness'', and a contributing writer for [[The Grio]], [[The Daily Beast]], [[HuffPost]], ''Bitch'' magazine, and ''The Hollywood Reporter''.

Produced by [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Signature Studios]], they are set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]].\n\nCable channel [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] ordered ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]'', a youth-oriented superhero series starring [[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]], from Marvel Television in April 2016 following years of development. Later in 2016, the similarly younger-skewing ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' was ordered from Marvel Television by the streaming service [[Hulu]]. Both Freeform and Hulu are Disney owned, and share the two series through a marketing partnership. Despite initially stating that the two series would be kept separate, Marvel Television announced a crossover between the two in August 2019 with Holt and Joseph appearing in the third season of ''Runaways''. The studio first categorized the two series as an interconnected \"YA\" franchise at that time, with plans to continue having them crossover.\n\n''Runaways'' debuted in November 2017, with ''Cloak & Dagger'' following in June 2018. Both received positive reviews. Freeform ordered another young adult series from Marvel, ''[[New Warriors (TV pilot)|New Warriors]]'', but the project did not move forward. ''Cloak & Dagger'' and ''Runaways'' were both cancelled by their respective networks before the end of November 2019, and development on any further young adult series was halted a month later when Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]].\n\n==Development==\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2011, [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] announced a series based on the [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] was in development at [[ABC Family]].<ref name=\"ABCFamilyDevelopment\" /> In April 2016, the series received a straight-to-series order at [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] (the new name of ABC Family) from [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]] and Marvel Television.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /> In August, Marvel Television announced that [[Hulu]] had ordered a new series based on the comics group the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu2\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> and the studio had also begun development on a half-hour comedy series based on the [[New Warriors]] team, featuring the character [[Squirrel Girl]]. The latter series was being offered to cable networks and streaming outlets.<ref name=\"TVLineNWAug2016\" />\n\nFreeform ordered ''New Warriors'' straight-to-series in April 2017. The network's EVP of programming Karey Burke explained that they were interested in a Squirrel Girl series before Marvel was moving forward with the project, and before Freeform ordered ''Cloak & Dagger''. Burke felt Freeform was the best network for ''New Warriors'', believing that Marvel had \"started to see our strength with young adults\" following the success of ''Cloak & Dagger'', and both companies wanted to \"find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience.\" Burke said ''New Warriors'' and ''Cloak & Dagger'' would not be \"particularly connected\" given their different tones, but that a crossover between the two was possible.<ref name=\"NWApr2017\" /> Loeb confirmed in July 2017 that these series would take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) alongside Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]] as well as [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] from [[Marvel Studios]], but said there were no plans to have ''Cloak & Dagger'' crossover with ''New Warriors'', nor have either of those series crossover across networks with the similarly youth-oriented ''Runaways''. Loeb explained that Marvel wanted the individual series to find their footing before crossing over with other elements of the MCU, and felt \"things that are happening in L.A.

characters that appear in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. Produced by [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Signature Studios]], they are set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]].\n\nCable channel [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] ordered ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]'', a youth-oriented superhero series starring [[Olivia Holt]] and [[Aubrey Joseph]], from Marvel Television in April 2016 following years of development. Later in 2016, the similarly younger-skewing ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]'' was ordered from Marvel Television by the streaming service [[Hulu]]. Both Freeform and Hulu are Disney owned, and share the two series through a marketing partnership. Despite initially stating that the two series would be kept separate, Marvel Television announced a crossover between the two in August 2019 with Holt and Joseph appearing in the third season of ''Runaways''. The studio first categorized the two series as an interconnected \"YA\" franchise at that time, with plans to continue having them crossover.\n\n''Runaways'' debuted in November 2017, with ''Cloak & Dagger'' following in June 2018. Both received positive reviews. Freeform ordered another young adult series from Marvel, ''[[New Warriors (TV pilot)|New Warriors]]'', but the project did not move forward. ''Cloak & Dagger'' and ''Runaways'' were both cancelled by their respective networks before the end of November 2019, and development on any further young adult series was halted a month later when Marvel Television was folded into [[Marvel Studios]].\n\n==Development==\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2011, [[Marvel Television]] head [[Jeph Loeb]] announced a series based on the [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] was in development at [[ABC Family]].<ref name=\"ABCFamilyDevelopment\" /> In April 2016, the series received a straight-to-series order at [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] (the new name of ABC Family) from [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]] and Marvel Television.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" /> In August, Marvel Television announced that [[Hulu]] had ordered a new series based on the comics group the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]],<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu2\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysSeriesOrder\" /> and the studio had also begun development on a half-hour comedy series based on the [[New Warriors]] team, featuring the character [[Squirrel Girl]]. The latter series was being offered to cable networks and streaming outlets.<ref name=\"TVLineNWAug2016\" />\n\nFreeform ordered ''New Warriors'' straight-to-series in April 2017. The network's EVP of programming Karey Burke explained that they were interested in a Squirrel Girl series before Marvel was moving forward with the project, and before Freeform ordered ''Cloak & Dagger''. Burke felt Freeform was the best network for ''New Warriors'', believing that Marvel had \"started to see our strength with young adults\" following the success of ''Cloak & Dagger'', and both companies wanted to \"find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience.\" Burke said ''New Warriors'' and ''Cloak & Dagger'' would not be \"particularly connected\" given their different tones, but that a crossover between the two was possible.<ref name=\"NWApr2017\" /> Loeb confirmed in July 2017 that these series would take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) alongside Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]] as well as [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] from [[Marvel Studios]], but said there were no plans to have ''Cloak & Dagger'' crossover with ''New Warriors'', nor have either of those series crossover across networks with the similarly youth-oriented ''Runaways''. Loeb explained that Marvel wanted the individual series to find their footing before crossing over with other elements of the MCU, and felt \"things that are happening in L.A.

She was taken into care when her mother became addicted to drugs. Erin tells [[Sonya Mitchell]] ([[Eve Morey]]) that Cat does not want to see her, and they only communicate through Facebook. Sonya's husband, [[Toadfish Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]), sets up a meeting between Cat and Erin, but Cat pulls out at the last minute as she is too nervous. Cat asks for another meeting and turns up early. She bonds with Toadie over BMX bikes and talks with her mother. Cat leaves abruptly when she learns that Erin came to see her cricket matches, but did not speak with her. Erin writers Cat a letter and she returns to see Erin. They bond while playing cricket and when Erin asks Cat to stay a few days, she agrees. However, when Cat turns up she learns Erin has gone. Toadie and Sonya allow Cat to spend the night with them. Cat later asks Sonya and Toadie if she can live with them, as she does not want to stay with her foster parents, who she feels do not want her as they are expecting a baby. Sonya invites Cat's foster mother, [[#Lorraine Newman|Lorraine]] (Michelle Celebicanin), over to talk. Lorraine convinces Cat that she is wanted and Cat decides to return home.

Sometimes a bit scary.\"<ref name=\"Tough\"/> Chapman enjoyed playing Michelle, as she evolved to become \"tougher and meaner\".<ref name=\"Tough\"/>\n\nWhen [[Matt Turner (Neighbours)|Matt Turner]] ([[Josef Brown]]) starts a new job as a security guard at Dimato Industries, he meets with Michelle, who tells him his duties. Michelle tries to befriend Matt and offers him a dress from surplus stock for his wife. She later calls her boss, Dennis Dimato, to tell him that getting Matt onside will not be hard. Matt quits his job after learning he is working for Dimato, but soon meets with Michelle to ask for it back as he needs the money. He later asks her for extra shifts. Michelle meets [[Tyler Brennan]] (Travis Burns) and gives him the details about his new job stripping stolen cars for parts. Michelle later congratulates Tyler for stealing items on a list given to him by Dimato, and she asks him to continue working for them. She exploits his strained relationship with his brother [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and convinces him to steal cars. When Tyler takes a car that is tracked by the police, Dimato is arrested. When he gets out on bail, he and Michelle buy Fitzgerald Motors to use as a cover for their business. Dimato flees the country and leaves Michelle in charge.\n\nWhen [[Bailey Turner]] (Calen Mackenzie) takes one of the stolen cars, Michelle demands that Tyler steals a replacement or give her $8,000. After learning [[Paige Smith]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) reported the stolen car to the police, Michelle blackmails her into helping Tyler. He tries to persuade her to leave Paige out of it, but Michelle makes her the new garage assistant. A few days later, Michelle tells Paige that they have drop off some car parts. However, the police, having been tipped off, arrive and Michelle and Paige try to escape. Michelle trips and sprains her ankle, but Paige helps her. At the hospital, Michelle claims she tripped running for the bus. She accepts Paige's plan to run the garage as a legit business. Dimato later returns to town and reunites with Michelle and their group. Tyler tries to run and Michelle suspects he is spying for the police. When the police eventually arrive, Michelle tries to escape, but Paige trips her up with a dustbin and she is arrested.\n\nA few months later, Michelle is released and she asks Mark for help as Dimato is out for revenge against her, Tyler and Paige. Michelle later turns up at Number 24 and tells Paige that she does not feel safe at the caravan park, where the police have hidden her. They bond over family problems and stay in touch via text messages. Michelle asks Paige to meet her, which results in Paige being knocked out and put in a car boot. Michelle later turns up at Paige's house, claiming that Dimato found her and attacked her. Paige lets her stay the night and tries to help, unaware that Michelle is using make-up to fake her bruises, so she can trick Paige into thinking Dimato is after her, as part of a plan to set Paige up for burglary. Dimato later punches Michelle for real during an argument, but despite this she continues with the plan. After renting an apartment in her name for Michelle, Paige discovers the truth when she finds a large number of stolen items in the apartment, and Michelle tips off the police. Paige manages to remove the items before the police arrive, while [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) blackmails Dimato into leaving town, after which Michelle also abandons Erinsborough.\n\n==Tyler Brennan==\n{{Main|Tyler Brennan}}\n'''Tyler Brennan''', played by [[Travis Burns (actor)|Travis Burns]], made his first screen appearance on 6 February 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/meet-travis-burns-australias-newest-tv-hunk/story-fn948wjf-1227210391915|title=Meet Travis Burns, Australia\u2019s newest TV hunk|last=Bucklow|first=Andrew|date=6 February 2015|work=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref> The character and casting was announced on 3 November 2014.<ref name=\"BigBrother\">{{cite web|url=http://tenplay.com.au/channel-eleven/neighbours/show-news/scott-takes-on-big-brother-role|title=Scott takes on big brother role...|date=30 October 2014|publisher=[[Network Ten]]|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> Burns was asked to audition for the part while he was in the United States earlier in the year.<ref name=\"MField\">{{cite journal|last=Field|first=Melissa|date=6\u201319 November 2014|title=Moving in!|journal=[[TV Week Soap Extra]]|issue=8}}</ref> Of his casting, he said \"When you score a role on a show as iconic as ''Neighbours'', you don't say no.

While he is at The Waterhole, Karl introduces Nick to nurse Georgia Brooks. She attempts to tell him about working at the hospital, but he cuts her off as he is trying to send an email. Nick catches up with his sister, Terese, and stays for lunch with her family. Terese's husband, [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) is uneasy about Nick's arrival and later tells Terese that Nick engineered a meeting between Brad, his former wife and son before their wedding. Terese confronts Nick, who admits that he wanted to see if Brad was faithful to her. Nick befriends [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) and decides to accept the job at the hospital. During a function at Paul's penthouse, [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason) chokes on some food and Georgia saves his life. When Nick questions Georgia as to why she did call for his help, she calls him arrogant. Nick makes a bet with Paul that he can have sex with Georgia, even though she is married. Nick gets closer to Georgia when he asks for her help with fundraising ideas. He gives her tickets to the ballet as a gesture of thanks and accompanies her when her husband is busy with work. Nick later asks Georgia to a conference in Hobart, but Georgia overhears him talking about the bet with Paul. He tries to pass it off as a joke, but Georgia pours her drink over him, causing Nick's stutter to return. Paul angers Nick when he informs him that his application for a cancer research centre has been denied. Nick doctors Paul's blood test results and tells Paul that he has leukaemia. Nick begins Paul on a course of chemotherapy.\n\nPaul tells Nick that he is willing to back his plans for the treatment centre, after the sale of the site does not go through. Nick tries apologising to Georgia again, but she makes a complaint against him. She is suspended from work after she accuses Nick of framing her by hacking into her social media page to reveal a patient's details. When Nick learns the decision about the research centre has been delayed, he tells Paul that his body has stopped responding to the chemotherapy. Paul later informs Nick that the cancer centre has the go-ahead. Nick finds Georgia in his hotel room and believes she has been going through his computer. She is arrested and later fired from the hospital. Paul collapses at The Waterhole and Nick is prevented from treating him in private. Georgia confronts Nick and claims that he has faked Paul's illness. Georgia takes the evidence to [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]), who questions both Nick and Paul. Nick is suspended when IT find out that he deleted Paul's patient files. He confesses what he did to Terese, claiming his motivation was to find a cure for cancer. He then attempts to flee Erinsborough, but Brad calls the police and Nick is arrested. Paul asks to see him and tells him that the research centre will be shut down and he will see to it that Nick loses his medical license. At the station, Nick belittles his family, before he is led away.\n\nTwo years later, Terese's fianc\u00e9 [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) visits Nick in prison. He tells Nick that Terese has been diagnosed with breast cancer and that her current treatment is not working, before asking him for his help. Terese also visits Nick and he recommends [[immunotherapy]], but tells her he has to get out of prison in order to help. Terese agrees to talk at his parole hearing, while [[Clive Gibbons]] (Geoff Paine), the hospital's COO writes a letter of recommendation. Paul also comes to see Nick to let him know that he will do everything he can to stop his release. However, Nick is paroled under the condition that does not practice medicine, but he can continue his research and oversee Terese's treatment. Nick is reacquainted with his niece [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel), while [[David Tanaka]] ([[Takaya Honda]]) is assigned to oversee Nick's work. While attending church, Nick helps [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) when she sprains her ankle. Nick soon learns Amy is Paul's daughter and attempts to speak to her, but [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) tells him to stay away. ''The West Waratah Star'' publishes an article about Nick's employment at the hospital and the hospital board threatens to reverse the decision to let Nick consult on Terese's treatment. A further article painting Nick in a more favourable light is later published.\n\nGary overhears Nick on the phone admitting to keeping something from Terese, before putting a file in his briefcase. Amy invites Nick to the penthouse for a drink. He later realises she has taken his file. Amy refuses to hand it over until he tells her the truth. Nick says he wants to help Terese and attempts to take the file from Amy, who hits him with a vase. Amy learns that Nick wants to open a wellness centre for cancer patients, and she apologises to him. They later spend the night together, and she comforts him when a young patient dies. [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) offers up Robinsons motel as the location for the wellness centre. Paul tries to write Nick a cheque for any amount, as long as Nick leaves town and opens his wellness centre in Perth, but Nick refuses the money. As Nick is spending time with Amy and Terese, Mark Brennan comes to search his room after receiving a tip off that Nick has taken cancer drugs from the hospital. Mark finds the drugs and Nick accuses Paul of planting them. A patient comes to Nick's hotel room claiming that Nick texted her to pick up the drugs. Mark finds the sent text on Nick's phone and takes him to the station, where his parole is revoked.\n\n==Jimmy Williams==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Jimmy Williams\n| portrayer = Darcy Tadich\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| years = 2015\u20132020\n| first = {{Start date|2015|06|10|df=y}}\n| last = {{End date|2020|01|01|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of past Neighbours characters#W|Former; regular]]\n| occupation = Student\n| home = [[New York City]]\n| family = [[Robinson family|Robinson]]\n| father = [[Liam Barnett]]\n| mother = [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]]\n| grandmothers = [[Nina Williams (Neighbours)|Nina Williams]]\n| grandfathers = [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]]\n| uncles = [[Leo Tanaka]]<br />[[David Tanaka]]\n| relatives = [[Daniel Robinson (Neighbours)|Daniel Robinson]]<br />[[Hilary Robinson]]<br />[[Madison Robinson (Neighbours)|Madison Robinson]]<br />[[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]]\n}}\n'''Jimmy Williams''', played by Darcy Tadich, made his first screen appearance on 10 June 2015.<ref name=\"AllChange\"/><ref name=\"Guides\">{{cite journal|date=4\u201318 June 2015|title=The guides|journal=TV Soap|page=40}}</ref> The character and Tadich's casting details were announced on 17 May 2015.<ref name=\"AllChange\"/> The role marks Tadich's television acting debut.<ref name=\"AllChange\"/> Tadich found the audition process \"nerve wracking\", but he decided to use his nervous energy during his performance.

Jimmy meets his grandfather for the first time and enjoys his stories of an old well nearby. He later disappears from [[Sonya Rebecchi]]'s ([[Eve Morey]]) garden and Amy suspects he has gone down the well. However, Jimmy goes to The Waterhole looking for Paul and he bonds with [[Naomi Canning]] ([[Morgana O'Reilly]]), Paul's assistant. Amy allows Paul to look after Jimmy while she is working for [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]). Paul connects with Jimmy and buys him expensive presents, which Amy later returns to him, having previously mentioned that Jimmy could not have them until Christmas. When Jimmy struggles with his science project, he calls Paul for help. Amy returns home to find them working together and is impressed that Paul did not need to spend money on Jimmy to help them bond. Jimmy finds a bag of letters that contain the secrets of the residents of [[Ramsay Street]]. He reads a couple and blackmails [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) into giving him a cake. He later tries the same thing with Karl's wife [[Susan Kennedy|Susan]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]), but she marches him home to Sonya, who then tells Amy. Jimmy is reprimanded, but when he finds [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) secret, he blackmails her into giving him crisps and cake. When Sheila cannot cope with the pressure, she shakes Jimmy. His cries attract Amy's attention and Sheila admits that he has been blackmailing her. Jimmy and Sheila later apologise to each other.\n\nJimmy befriends Kyle and spends a lot of his time at the Dial-a-Kyle builders yard. Amy and Kyle develop feelings for each other, but their potential romance is halted when Jimmy's father [[Liam Barnett]] (James Beck) visits. Jimmy and Liam spend time together. Amy allows Jimmy to walk to a Dial-a-Kyle, but he goes missing. [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) finds him hiding out at the high school and he is reunited with Amy. He later witnesses his father accepting a bribe from Paul never to contact him or Amy again, after which Jimmy becomes distant from Paul. Amy and Jimmy move in with Kyle and Sheila. Jimmy initially dislikes Kyle taking the place of Liam, until he is told of his father's crimes. Jimmy befriends Steph's son [[Charlie Hoyland]] (Alexander McGuire) when he comes to stay. When Paul goes on the run, after being accused of causing an explosion at Lassiters Hotel, Jimmy finds him and warns him that the police are on their way. Jimmy follows Paul into the bush and is stung by a bee, which causes him to suffer an allergic reaction. Paul takes him to the hospital and is arrested. Jimmy struggles with Paul's imprisonment. He challenges Charlie to a series of dares. When Steph has to work, [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) takes the boys on a tour around the police station. Jimmy steals some pepper spray and sprays the can at Charlie as part of a dare. Charlie requires medical treatment at the hospital. When Amy confronts him, Jimmy admits that he is just trying to have fun, as he has been abandoned by his father, grandfather and Kyle, who left to reunite with his wife. While Jimmy and Charlie are playing with a drone, they lose control of it and Jimmy gets on his bike to catch up to it. He is struck by a car and the driver leaves the scene. Jimmy is rushed to the hospital, where he has to undergo surgery to remove a ruptured spleen. Kyle returns for a visit and Amy decides to move out, causing Jimmy to blame Kyle for not being able to live at Number 26 anymore. Sheila convinces them to stay, but months later Amy and Jimmy move in with Paul at the Lassiters penthouse.\n\nJimmy crashes his drone and believes that he caused Steph to crash her bike, but when he reports it to the police, he is informed that a broken muffler caused Steph's accident. After Jimmy has a check-up at the hospital, he and Amy meet [[Nick Petrides]] ([[Damien Fotiou]]), who asks Jimmy if he would play chess with a patient of his. Jimmy initially refuses, as he dislikes Nick due to history with Paul, but later changes his mind and bonds with Nick. While riding his bike through the Lassiters complex, Jimmy realises he is going to hit [[Kirsha Rebecchi]] (Vani Dhir) and shouts at her to get out of the way, but as she cannot hear, her father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) pushes her aside and Jimmy hits him with his bike instead, resulting in Shane injuring his hand. Jimmy decides to buy Kirsha a smart watch so she can access her talk to text app more easily, but he has no money. [[Tia Martinez]] (Erica Brown) suggests that he steals alcohol from the hotel rooms, as her brother would buy it. Jimmy later takes several bottles from [[Xanthe Canning]]'s (Lilly Van der Meer) housekeeping cart and sells them to [[List of Neighbours characters (2018)#Gus Martinez|Gus Martinez]] (Blake Draper). Tia later plants some of the alcohol bottles in Xanthe's school bag out of revenge. After Xanthe is suspended from school and the hotel, Jimmy admits that he stole the bottles. Jimmy develops a crush on [[Poppy Ryan]] (Eloise Ross), but struggles to talk to her, so Kirsha helps him to ask Poppy out on a date. Jimmy and Poppy soon begin dating. Jimmy's father Liam returns to Erinsborough and attempts to repair his relationship with his son. Jimmy decides to walk home from school when he feels ill, but due to his weakened immune system, he collapses. Liam finds him and rushes him to the hospital, where he recovers. Kirsha tells Jimmy that Poppy has being bullying her, so he asks Poppy to stop and then breaks up with her. Jimmy learns that Liam is leaving town again and he believes it may be his fault. Amy eventually tells him that Liam has a job offer in New York City and wanted Jimmy to go with him, but she asked him to leave instead. Jimmy assures his mother that he would never have left with Liam, but he later tells Kirsha that it would be cool to go to New York. Paul later asks Jimmy whether he wants to go and Jimmy tells him that he does, as it is only for six months. Amy gives Jimmy her blessing to go, and Paul accompanies Jimmy and Liam to New York to help him settle in.\n\nThe following year, Amy's partner [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) flies Jimmy over to Erinsborough for her birthday party, and their surprise wedding. After Amy refuses to marry Gary at the party, she and Jimmy go away for a few days. On their return, Paul tries to convince Jimmy that Amy was happier with Kyle, but he says it is Amy's decision. Jimmy has dinner with Paul, [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), Gary and Amy before he leaves for the airport. Months later, Amy learns that Jimmy has been going through a difficult teenage phase. Jimmy returns to Erinsborough, after Liam informs Leo that he is missing. Amy tries talking with him and Jimmy explains that he and Liam have been arguing for a few months. Amy also learns from Liam that Jimmy has been spending time with some friends that Liam disapproves of, so she confronts him about his behaviour. Jimmy later steals some money from Amy's purse. Amy discovers Jimmy has brought his girlfriend to Australia with him, and is hiding her from her abusive father. Jimmy begs Amy to move to New York with him as he misses her support. With her reconciliation with Kyle already on the rocks, Amy decides to break off their relationship and leave Erinsborough with Jimmy.\n\n==Aaron Brennan==\n{{Main|Aaron Brennan}}\n'''Aaron Brennan''', played by Matt Wilson, made his first screen appearance on 16 June 2015.<ref name=\"Bamford\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/matt-wilson-welcome-to-our-newest-neighbour/story-fni0cvc9-1227378507617|title=Matt Wilson: Welcome to our newest Neighbour|last=Bamford|first=Matt|date=1 June 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> The character and casting was announced on 17 May 2015.<ref name=\"AllChange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a647877/all-change-for-neighbours-four-new-regulars-join-the-soaps-cast.html#~pcYKylGLFjEg03|title=All change for Neighbours: Four new regulars join the soap's cast|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 May 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref> Wilson relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming.<ref name=\"Hunky\">{{cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/hunky-underwear-model-and-actor-matt-wilson-arrives-on-ramsay-street-playing-a-gay-male-stripper/story-fntzvnr9-1227400639625?nk=15ab8a767955440142f0d960db2f9bb6-1434460554|title=Hunky underwear model and actor Matt Wilson arrives on Ramsay Street, playing a gay male stripper|last=Molloy|first=Shannon|date=16 June 2015|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> Aaron is the third member of the Brennan family to be introduced, after his older and younger brothers [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Tyler Brennan]] (Travis Burns).<ref name=\"AllChange\"/> Wilson said Aaron was \"a very confident young guy\", who likes to make people happy and is unfazed by many things.<ref name=\"Hunky\"/> Aaron made \"a memorable entrance\" as a male stripper, before he tried to reconnect with his brothers.<ref name=\"Bamford\"/> Aaron is also gay and Matt Bamford from ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that he could be a love interest for [[Nate Kinski]] ([[Meyne Wyatt]]).<ref name=\"Bamford\"/> Anthony D.

Russell continues to bond with his sons and they arrange a barbecue, which Russell invites Tyler to. He apologises for beating him when he was younger.\n\nRussell and Sheila begin dating. She offers to help him buy Fitzgerald Motors, as he is unable to get a quick sale for his current garage in Port Lincoln. However, Mark finds out the money was illegally obtained by Sheila's son [[Gary Canning]] (Damien Richardson), so she hands it into the police instead. Mark and Aaron offer to help Russell buy the garage with their savings. Tyler and Russell spend the day with [[Ben Kirk]] (Felix Mallard), who they play practical jokes on. Russell loses his temper when Ben pulls down his shorts and [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) stops him from hitting Ben. Tyler is reminded of the past and begins acting up again. Russell challenges him on his behaviour and nearly hits him, but Tyler retaliates by punching him. When Mark finds out, he confronts Tyler, who reveals Russell's years of abuse. Russell confirms this to Mark and Aaron and they tell him to leave. He asks Sheila to come with him, but she refuses, telling him he needs to get help. They say goodbye, as his three sons look on.\n\nTwo years later, Russell suffers a massive heart attack and asks his former wife [[Fay Brennan]] ([[Zoe Bertram]]) to visit him. Shortly before his sons and Sheila are due to fly up to see him, Russell dies. It later becomes apparent that [[Hamish Roche]] (Sean Taylor) is Tyler's biological father rather than Russell, who was murdered by Hamish and his girlfriend, nurse [[Louise McLeod]] ([[Maria Theodorakis]]).\n\n==Courtney Grixti==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Courtney Grixti\n| portrayer = Emma Lane\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{Start date|2015|08|04|df=y}}\n| last = {{End date|2017|11|27|df=y}}\n| years = 2015\u20132017\n| classification = [[Recurring characters of Neighbours#G|Former; recurring]]\n| spinoffs = ''[[Mrs Robinson (Neighbours)|Mrs Robinson]]'' (2017)\n| home = [[Erinsborough]]\n| occupation = {{plainlist|\n*Barmaid\n*University student\n*Lassiter's Spa manager\n*Rejuvenation consultant\n}}\n| father = [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]]\n}}\n'''Courtney Grixti''', played by Emma Lane,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a665341/neighbours-star-teases-josh-willis-romance-in-new-behind-the-scenes-video.html#~pmzWvJqkbMgyak|title=Neighbours star teases Josh Willis romance in new behind-the-scenes video|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=26 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> made her first screen appearance on 4 August 2015.

She questions the cost of soft drinks when [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]) implements a new food and drinks policy for the staff, and then makes a comment about Terese's managerial privilege behind her back. Courtney meets Terese's son [[Josh Willis (Neighbours)|Josh]] (Bonner) and they have sex. He makes it clear that he wants to see her again, and they decide to go camping together. At the camp site, Courtney meets Josh's sisters [[Imogen Willis]] ([[Ariel Kaplan]]) and [[Paige Smith]] ([[Olympia Valance]]), and his pregnant ex-girlfriend [[Amber Turner]] (Jenna Rosenow). Courtney uses her body language reading skills to work out whether [[Aaron Brennan]] (Matt Wilson) is interested in her boss [[Nate Kinski]] ([[Meyne Wyatt]]), and she bonds with Amber. When Josh reveals that he has moved out of his house, he asks Courtney if he can stay with her, but she turns him down and then breaks up with him. Courtney begins dating [[Tyler Brennan]] ([[Travis Burns (actor)|Travis Burns]]), causing [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel) to become jealous of her. Piper later films Courtney arguing and then hugging the much older mayoral candidate, [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]] ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]), thinking that they are having an affair. She publishes the film to smear Tim, but soon learns that Courtney is in fact Tim's daughter. Courtney is initially outraged by Piper's actions, but after Piper reveals that Tim intends to sue her, and that she is in love with Tyler, Courtney ultimately defuses the situation, convincing her father to drop the lawsuit.\n\nDisgusted when Tim tries to publicly humiliate Sonya, Courtney vandalises his car. She moves in with Tyler to get away from her father, but he becomes tired of her trying to run his life, and they break up. Courtney supports Paige after her relationship with Tyler's brother ends. They go out to a club together to show that they are moving on, and Courtney sets Paige up on a date with their older university lecturer, [[Noel Creighton]] (Kristian Beddow). Months later, Courtney and Paige are at The Waterhole when Tyler walks in. Courtney decides that she wants to get back together with him and convinces Paige to host a house party. Courtney flirts with Tyler at the party, but he is not interested and she leaves with [[Elly Conway]] ([[Jodi Anasta]]). Months later, Courtney comes to Paige's birthday party, and reveals that she has quit university. Terese gives Courtney a job at Lassiter's spa. Courtney receives large tips from male clients and sends Xanthe away during sessions. Sheila suspects that Courtney is illegally administering [[botox]], so [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) confronts her. Courtney tells him that she has designed a tailored service for some of her male clients and she offers them privacy while it happens. She treats Karl and he makes return visits, along with [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan), leading to further suspicion from their wives [[Susan Kennedy|Susan]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) and [[Dipi Rebecchi|Dipi]] (Sharon Johal). Terese later investigates Courtney and accuses her of giving the male clients a [[Erotic massage#Commercial erotic and sexual massage|happy ending]], which is broadcast to those inside The Waterhole by a microphone Courtney is wearing. Terese fires Courtney, but soon learns that she was using her psychology skills to offer massages and emotional therapy, which often made the male clients cry. Terese apologises and attempts to offer Courtney her job back, but Courtney quits. Susan and Dipi also offer their apologies. Courtney soon realises that Tim believed the rumours too. She decides to leave the country for a while, and later sues Terese for $5 million. A few weeks later, Courtney returns to Erinsborough engaged to [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]).\n\nPaul convinces Courtney to drop the lawsuit against Terese, as he is now the biggest investor in the hotel, which means Terese has to answer to him and Courtney, who Paul hires as a Rejuvenation Consultant. Paul and Courtney inform his children of their engagement and [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) suspects Courtney is after Paul's money. Tim tries to get Courtney to come home, but she refuses. Paul's son [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) helps Courtney give a speech to the judges of the Most Liveable Suburb Competition. After thanking him for his help, she tells him he is welcome to stay the night. Courtney apologises, telling him that she is naturally flirty, but she is committed to Paul. Leo later attempts to kiss Courtney, but she pushes him away. She decides not to tell Paul, as she does not want to hurt him. Paul soon admits that he and Courtney are not in a relationship, and that they just wanted to get revenge on Terese and Tim. Courtney hosts a silent disco at The Waterhole, but it does not attract much attention. Paul saves the event by turning it into a tea dance for his cousin [[Hilary Robinson]] (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) and her friends. After dancing together, Courtney tells Paul that they should make their relationship real, but Paul is hesitant. He later suggests to Courtney that they elope. Tim accosts Courtney outside Lassiters, where she tells him that she and Paul are married. She then tells Amy, Leo and their friends. However, it emerges that they did not go through with the ceremony. Courtney begins packing up her belongings to move out of the penthouse, but she remarks that she has nowhere to go. Paul tells Tim the truth and brings him back to the penthouse to speak with Courtney. Tim tells her that he cares for her and apologises for pushing her too hard. He asks her to return home and she agrees. Courtney gives Paul her resignation from Lassiters and he tells her to keep the engagement and wedding rings.\n\n==Piper Willis==\n{{Main|Piper Willis}}\n'''Piper Willis''', played by Mavournee Hazel, made her first screen appearance on 16 September 2015.<ref name=\"Mavournee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/articles/neighbours-mavournee-hazel-joins-as-piper-willis|title=Neighbours: Mavournee Hazel joins as Piper Willis|date=21 August 2015|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> The character has often been mentioned since the arrival of her on-screen family in May 2013, while Hazel's casting was announced on 18 August 2015.<ref name=\"Piper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a664056/neighbours-bringing-in-piper-willis-as-actress-mavournee-hazel-lands-role.html#~plJpZRUs7OVKdH|title=Neighbours bringing in Piper Willis as actress Mavournee Hazel lands role|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> The actress relocated to Melbourne for filming and commented \"It's a great feeling to be rewarded with the role of Piper after years of hard work, especially when I fell in love with the character after my first audition.\"<ref name=\"Mavournee\"/> Ahead of her first appearance, the character was featured in a series of webisodes titled ''[[Hey Piper]]'', which see her talking to her family via online video calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a668831/meet-piper-willis-neighbours-introduces-its-newest-regular-in-special-webisodes.html#~posY6mX4Yc6nHH|title=Meet Piper Willis: Neighbours introduces its newest regular in special webisodes|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=16 September 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> Piper is the youngest daughter of [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) and [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]).

While he is at The Waterhole, Karl introduces Nick to nurse Georgia Brooks. She attempts to tell him about working at the hospital, but he cuts her off as he is trying to send an email. Nick catches up with his sister, Terese, and stays for lunch with her family. Terese's husband, [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) is uneasy about Nick's arrival and later tells Terese that Nick engineered a meeting between Brad, his former wife and son before their wedding. Terese confronts Nick, who admits that he wanted to see if Brad was faithful to her. Nick befriends [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) and decides to accept the job at the hospital. During a function at Paul's penthouse, [[Chris Pappas (Neighbours)|Chris Pappas]] (James Mason) chokes on some food and Georgia saves his life. When Nick questions Georgia as to why she did call for his help, she calls him arrogant. Nick makes a bet with Paul that he can have sex with Georgia, even though she is married. Nick gets closer to Georgia when he asks for her help with fundraising ideas. He gives her tickets to the ballet as a gesture of thanks and accompanies her when her husband is busy with work. Nick later asks Georgia to a conference in Hobart, but Georgia overhears him talking about the bet with Paul. He tries to pass it off as a joke, but Georgia pours her drink over him, causing Nick's stutter to return. Paul angers Nick when he informs him that his application for a cancer research centre has been denied. Nick doctors Paul's blood test results and tells Paul that he has leukaemia. Nick begins Paul on a course of chemotherapy.\n\nPaul tells Nick that he is willing to back his plans for the treatment centre, after the sale of the site does not go through. Nick tries apologising to Georgia again, but she makes a complaint against him. She is suspended from work after she accuses Nick of framing her by hacking into her social media page to reveal a patient's details. When Nick learns the decision about the research centre has been delayed, he tells Paul that his body has stopped responding to the chemotherapy. Paul later informs Nick that the cancer centre has the go-ahead. Nick finds Georgia in his hotel room and believes she has been going through his computer. She is arrested and later fired from the hospital. Paul collapses at The Waterhole and Nick is prevented from treating him in private. Georgia confronts Nick and claims that he has faked Paul's illness. Georgia takes the evidence to [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]), who questions both Nick and Paul. Nick is suspended when IT find out that he deleted Paul's patient files. He confesses what he did to Terese, claiming his motivation was to find a cure for cancer. He then attempts to flee Erinsborough, but Brad calls the police and Nick is arrested. Paul asks to see him and tells him that the research centre will be shut down and he will see to it that Nick loses his medical license. At the station, Nick belittles his family, before he is led away.\n\nTwo years later, Terese's fianc\u00e9 [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) visits Nick in prison. He tells Nick that Terese has been diagnosed with breast cancer and that her current treatment is not working, before asking him for his help. Terese also visits Nick and he recommends [[immunotherapy]], but tells her he has to get out of prison in order to help. Terese agrees to talk at his parole hearing, while [[Clive Gibbons]] (Geoff Paine), the hospital's COO writes a letter of recommendation. Paul also comes to see Nick to let him know that he will do everything he can to stop his release. However, Nick is paroled under the condition that does not practice medicine, but he can continue his research and oversee Terese's treatment. Nick is reacquainted with his niece [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel), while [[David Tanaka]] ([[Takaya Honda]]) is assigned to oversee Nick's work. While attending church, Nick helps [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) when she sprains her ankle. Nick soon learns Amy is Paul's daughter and attempts to speak to her, but [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) tells him to stay away. ''The West Waratah Star'' publishes an article about Nick's employment at the hospital and the hospital board threatens to reverse the decision to let Nick consult on Terese's treatment. A further article painting Nick in a more favourable light is later published.\n\nGary overhears Nick on the phone admitting to keeping something from Terese, before putting a file in his briefcase. Amy invites Nick to the penthouse for a drink. He later realises she has taken his file. Amy refuses to hand it over until he tells her the truth. Nick says he wants to help Terese and attempts to take the file from Amy, who hits him with a vase. Amy learns that Nick wants to open a wellness centre for cancer patients, and she apologises to him. They later spend the night together, and she comforts him when a young patient dies. [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) offers up Robinsons motel as the location for the wellness centre. Paul tries to write Nick a cheque for any amount, as long as Nick leaves town and opens his wellness centre in Perth, but Nick refuses the money. As Nick is spending time with Amy and Terese, Mark Brennan comes to search his room after receiving a tip off that Nick has taken cancer drugs from the hospital. Mark finds the drugs and Nick accuses Paul of planting them. A patient comes to Nick's hotel room claiming that Nick texted her to pick up the drugs. Mark finds the sent text on Nick's phone and takes him to the station, where his parole is revoked.\n\n==Jimmy Williams==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Jimmy Williams\n| portrayer = Darcy Tadich\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| years = 2015\u20132020\n| first = {{Start date|2015|06|10|df=y}}\n| last = {{End date|2020|01|01|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of past Neighbours characters#W|Former; regular]]\n| occupation = Student\n| home = [[New York City]]\n| family = [[Robinson family|Robinson]]\n| father = [[Liam Barnett]]\n| mother = [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]]\n| grandmothers = [[Nina Williams (Neighbours)|Nina Williams]]\n| grandfathers = [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]]\n| uncles = [[Leo Tanaka]]<br />[[David Tanaka]]\n| relatives = [[Daniel Robinson (Neighbours)|Daniel Robinson]]<br />[[Hilary Robinson]]<br />[[Madison Robinson (Neighbours)|Madison Robinson]]<br />[[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]]\n}}\n'''Jimmy Williams''', played by Darcy Tadich, made his first screen appearance on 10 June 2015.<ref name=\"AllChange\"/><ref name=\"Guides\">{{cite journal|date=4\u201318 June 2015|title=The guides|journal=TV Soap|page=40}}</ref> The character and Tadich's casting details were announced on 17 May 2015.<ref name=\"AllChange\"/> The role marks Tadich's television acting debut.<ref name=\"AllChange\"/> Tadich found the audition process \"nerve wracking\", but he decided to use his nervous energy during his performance.

Jimmy meets his grandfather for the first time and enjoys his stories of an old well nearby. He later disappears from [[Sonya Rebecchi]]'s ([[Eve Morey]]) garden and Amy suspects he has gone down the well. However, Jimmy goes to The Waterhole looking for Paul and he bonds with [[Naomi Canning]] ([[Morgana O'Reilly]]), Paul's assistant. Amy allows Paul to look after Jimmy while she is working for [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]). Paul connects with Jimmy and buys him expensive presents, which Amy later returns to him, having previously mentioned that Jimmy could not have them until Christmas. When Jimmy struggles with his science project, he calls Paul for help. Amy returns home to find them working together and is impressed that Paul did not need to spend money on Jimmy to help them bond. Jimmy finds a bag of letters that contain the secrets of the residents of [[Ramsay Street]]. He reads a couple and blackmails [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) into giving him a cake. He later tries the same thing with Karl's wife [[Susan Kennedy|Susan]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]), but she marches him home to Sonya, who then tells Amy. Jimmy is reprimanded, but when he finds [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) secret, he blackmails her into giving him crisps and cake. When Sheila cannot cope with the pressure, she shakes Jimmy. His cries attract Amy's attention and Sheila admits that he has been blackmailing her. Jimmy and Sheila later apologise to each other.\n\nJimmy befriends Kyle and spends a lot of his time at the Dial-a-Kyle builders yard. Amy and Kyle develop feelings for each other, but their potential romance is halted when Jimmy's father [[Liam Barnett]] (James Beck) visits. Jimmy and Liam spend time together. Amy allows Jimmy to walk to a Dial-a-Kyle, but he goes missing. [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) finds him hiding out at the high school and he is reunited with Amy. He later witnesses his father accepting a bribe from Paul never to contact him or Amy again, after which Jimmy becomes distant from Paul. Amy and Jimmy move in with Kyle and Sheila. Jimmy initially dislikes Kyle taking the place of Liam, until he is told of his father's crimes. Jimmy befriends Steph's son [[Charlie Hoyland]] (Alexander McGuire) when he comes to stay. When Paul goes on the run, after being accused of causing an explosion at Lassiters Hotel, Jimmy finds him and warns him that the police are on their way. Jimmy follows Paul into the bush and is stung by a bee, which causes him to suffer an allergic reaction. Paul takes him to the hospital and is arrested. Jimmy struggles with Paul's imprisonment. He challenges Charlie to a series of dares. When Steph has to work, [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) takes the boys on a tour around the police station. Jimmy steals some pepper spray and sprays the can at Charlie as part of a dare. Charlie requires medical treatment at the hospital. When Amy confronts him, Jimmy admits that he is just trying to have fun, as he has been abandoned by his father, grandfather and Kyle, who left to reunite with his wife. While Jimmy and Charlie are playing with a drone, they lose control of it and Jimmy gets on his bike to catch up to it. He is struck by a car and the driver leaves the scene. Jimmy is rushed to the hospital, where he has to undergo surgery to remove a ruptured spleen. Kyle returns for a visit and Amy decides to move out, causing Jimmy to blame Kyle for not being able to live at Number 26 anymore. Sheila convinces them to stay, but months later Amy and Jimmy move in with Paul at the Lassiters penthouse.\n\nJimmy crashes his drone and believes that he caused Steph to crash her bike, but when he reports it to the police, he is informed that a broken muffler caused Steph's accident. After Jimmy has a check-up at the hospital, he and Amy meet [[Nick Petrides]] ([[Damien Fotiou]]), who asks Jimmy if he would play chess with a patient of his. Jimmy initially refuses, as he dislikes Nick due to history with Paul, but later changes his mind and bonds with Nick. While riding his bike through the Lassiters complex, Jimmy realises he is going to hit [[Kirsha Rebecchi]] (Vani Dhir) and shouts at her to get out of the way, but as she cannot hear, her father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) pushes her aside and Jimmy hits him with his bike instead, resulting in Shane injuring his hand. Jimmy decides to buy Kirsha a smart watch so she can access her talk to text app more easily, but he has no money. [[Tia Martinez]] (Erica Brown) suggests that he steals alcohol from the hotel rooms, as her brother would buy it. Jimmy later takes several bottles from [[Xanthe Canning]]'s (Lilly Van der Meer) housekeeping cart and sells them to [[List of Neighbours characters (2018)#Gus Martinez|Gus Martinez]] (Blake Draper). Tia later plants some of the alcohol bottles in Xanthe's school bag out of revenge. After Xanthe is suspended from school and the hotel, Jimmy admits that he stole the bottles. Jimmy develops a crush on [[Poppy Ryan]] (Eloise Ross), but struggles to talk to her, so Kirsha helps him to ask Poppy out on a date. Jimmy and Poppy soon begin dating. Jimmy's father Liam returns to Erinsborough and attempts to repair his relationship with his son. Jimmy decides to walk home from school when he feels ill, but due to his weakened immune system, he collapses. Liam finds him and rushes him to the hospital, where he recovers. Kirsha tells Jimmy that Poppy has being bullying her, so he asks Poppy to stop and then breaks up with her. Jimmy learns that Liam is leaving town again and he believes it may be his fault. Amy eventually tells him that Liam has a job offer in New York City and wanted Jimmy to go with him, but she asked him to leave instead. Jimmy assures his mother that he would never have left with Liam, but he later tells Kirsha that it would be cool to go to New York. Paul later asks Jimmy whether he wants to go and Jimmy tells him that he does, as it is only for six months. Amy gives Jimmy her blessing to go, and Paul accompanies Jimmy and Liam to New York to help him settle in.\n\nThe following year, Amy's partner [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) flies Jimmy over to Erinsborough for her birthday party, and their surprise wedding. After Amy refuses to marry Gary at the party, she and Jimmy go away for a few days. On their return, Paul tries to convince Jimmy that Amy was happier with Kyle, but he says it is Amy's decision. Jimmy has dinner with Paul, [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), Gary and Amy before he leaves for the airport. Months later, Amy learns that Jimmy has been going through a difficult teenage phase. Jimmy returns to Erinsborough, after Liam informs Leo that he is missing. Amy tries talking with him and Jimmy explains that he and Liam have been arguing for a few months. Amy also learns from Liam that Jimmy has been spending time with some friends that Liam disapproves of, so she confronts him about his behaviour. Jimmy later steals some money from Amy's purse. Amy discovers Jimmy has brought his girlfriend to Australia with him, and is hiding her from her abusive father. Jimmy begs Amy to move to New York with him as he misses her support. With her reconciliation with Kyle already on the rocks, Amy decides to break off their relationship and leave Erinsborough with Jimmy.\n\n==Aaron Brennan==\n{{Main|Aaron Brennan}}\n'''Aaron Brennan''', played by Matt Wilson, made his first screen appearance on 16 June 2015.<ref name=\"Bamford\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/matt-wilson-welcome-to-our-newest-neighbour/story-fni0cvc9-1227378507617|title=Matt Wilson: Welcome to our newest Neighbour|last=Bamford|first=Matt|date=1 June 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> The character and casting was announced on 17 May 2015.<ref name=\"AllChange\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a647877/all-change-for-neighbours-four-new-regulars-join-the-soaps-cast.html#~pcYKylGLFjEg03|title=All change for Neighbours: Four new regulars join the soap's cast|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 May 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref> Wilson relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming.<ref name=\"Hunky\">{{cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/hunky-underwear-model-and-actor-matt-wilson-arrives-on-ramsay-street-playing-a-gay-male-stripper/story-fntzvnr9-1227400639625?nk=15ab8a767955440142f0d960db2f9bb6-1434460554|title=Hunky underwear model and actor Matt Wilson arrives on Ramsay Street, playing a gay male stripper|last=Molloy|first=Shannon|date=16 June 2015|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> Aaron is the third member of the Brennan family to be introduced, after his older and younger brothers [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Tyler Brennan]] (Travis Burns).<ref name=\"AllChange\"/> Wilson said Aaron was \"a very confident young guy\", who likes to make people happy and is unfazed by many things.<ref name=\"Hunky\"/> Aaron made \"a memorable entrance\" as a male stripper, before he tried to reconnect with his brothers.<ref name=\"Bamford\"/> Aaron is also gay and Matt Bamford from ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that he could be a love interest for [[Nate Kinski]] ([[Meyne Wyatt]]).<ref name=\"Bamford\"/> Anthony D.

Mark and Aaron offer to help Russell buy the garage with their savings. Tyler and Russell spend the day with [[Ben Kirk]] (Felix Mallard), who they play practical jokes on.

She questions the cost of soft drinks when [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]) implements a new food and drinks policy for the staff, and then makes a comment about Terese's managerial privilege behind her back. Courtney meets Terese's son [[Josh Willis (Neighbours)|Josh]] (Bonner) and they have sex. He makes it clear that he wants to see her again, and they decide to go camping together. At the camp site, Courtney meets Josh's sisters [[Imogen Willis]] ([[Ariel Kaplan]]) and [[Paige Smith]] ([[Olympia Valance]]), and his pregnant ex-girlfriend [[Amber Turner]] (Jenna Rosenow). Courtney uses her body language reading skills to work out whether [[Aaron Brennan]] (Matt Wilson) is interested in her boss [[Nate Kinski]] ([[Meyne Wyatt]]), and she bonds with Amber. When Josh reveals that he has moved out of his house, he asks Courtney if he can stay with her, but she turns him down and then breaks up with him. Courtney begins dating [[Tyler Brennan]] ([[Travis Burns (actor)|Travis Burns]]), causing [[Piper Willis]] (Mavournee Hazel) to become jealous of her. Piper later films Courtney arguing and then hugging the much older mayoral candidate, [[Tim Collins (Neighbours)|Tim Collins]] ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]), thinking that they are having an affair. She publishes the film to smear Tim, but soon learns that Courtney is in fact Tim's daughter. Courtney is initially outraged by Piper's actions, but after Piper reveals that Tim intends to sue her, and that she is in love with Tyler, Courtney ultimately defuses the situation, convincing her father to drop the lawsuit.\n\nDisgusted when Tim tries to publicly humiliate Sonya, Courtney vandalises his car. She moves in with Tyler to get away from her father, but he becomes tired of her trying to run his life, and they break up. Courtney supports Paige after her relationship with Tyler's brother ends. They go out to a club together to show that they are moving on, and Courtney sets Paige up on a date with their older university lecturer, [[Noel Creighton]] (Kristian Beddow). Months later, Courtney and Paige are at The Waterhole when Tyler walks in. Courtney decides that she wants to get back together with him and convinces Paige to host a house party. Courtney flirts with Tyler at the party, but he is not interested and she leaves with [[Elly Conway]] ([[Jodi Anasta]]). Months later, Courtney comes to Paige's birthday party, and reveals that she has quit university. Terese gives Courtney a job at Lassiter's spa. Courtney receives large tips from male clients and sends Xanthe away during sessions. Sheila suspects that Courtney is illegally administering [[botox]], so [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) confronts her. Courtney tells him that she has designed a tailored service for some of her male clients and she offers them privacy while it happens. She treats Karl and he makes return visits, along with [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan), leading to further suspicion from their wives [[Susan Kennedy|Susan]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) and [[Dipi Rebecchi|Dipi]] (Sharon Johal). Terese later investigates Courtney and accuses her of giving the male clients a [[Erotic massage#Commercial erotic and sexual massage|happy ending]], which is broadcast to those inside The Waterhole by a microphone Courtney is wearing. Terese fires Courtney, but soon learns that she was using her psychology skills to offer massages and emotional therapy, which often made the male clients cry. Terese apologises and attempts to offer Courtney her job back, but Courtney quits. Susan and Dipi also offer their apologies. Courtney soon realises that Tim believed the rumours too. She decides to leave the country for a while, and later sues Terese for $5 million. A few weeks later, Courtney returns to Erinsborough engaged to [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]).\n\nPaul convinces Courtney to drop the lawsuit against Terese, as he is now the biggest investor in the hotel, which means Terese has to answer to him and Courtney, who Paul hires as a Rejuvenation Consultant. Paul and Courtney inform his children of their engagement and [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) suspects Courtney is after Paul's money. Tim tries to get Courtney to come home, but she refuses. Paul's son [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) helps Courtney give a speech to the judges of the Most Liveable Suburb Competition. After thanking him for his help, she tells him he is welcome to stay the night. Courtney apologises, telling him that she is naturally flirty, but she is committed to Paul. Leo later attempts to kiss Courtney, but she pushes him away. She decides not to tell Paul, as she does not want to hurt him. Paul soon admits that he and Courtney are not in a relationship, and that they just wanted to get revenge on Terese and Tim. Courtney hosts a silent disco at The Waterhole, but it does not attract much attention. Paul saves the event by turning it into a tea dance for his cousin [[Hilary Robinson]] (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) and her friends. After dancing together, Courtney tells Paul that they should make their relationship real, but Paul is hesitant. He later suggests to Courtney that they elope. Tim accosts Courtney outside Lassiters, where she tells him that she and Paul are married. She then tells Amy, Leo and their friends. However, it emerges that they did not go through with the ceremony. Courtney begins packing up her belongings to move out of the penthouse, but she remarks that she has nowhere to go. Paul tells Tim the truth and brings him back to the penthouse to speak with Courtney. Tim tells her that he cares for her and apologises for pushing her too hard. He asks her to return home and she agrees. Courtney gives Paul her resignation from Lassiters and he tells her to keep the engagement and wedding rings.\n\n==Piper Willis==\n{{Main|Piper Willis}}\n'''Piper Willis''', played by Mavournee Hazel, made her first screen appearance on 16 September 2015.<ref name=\"Mavournee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/neighbours/articles/neighbours-mavournee-hazel-joins-as-piper-willis|title=Neighbours: Mavournee Hazel joins as Piper Willis|date=21 August 2015|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> The character has often been mentioned since the arrival of her on-screen family in May 2013, while Hazel's casting was announced on 18 August 2015.<ref name=\"Piper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a664056/neighbours-bringing-in-piper-willis-as-actress-mavournee-hazel-lands-role.html#~plJpZRUs7OVKdH|title=Neighbours bringing in Piper Willis as actress Mavournee Hazel lands role|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 August 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> The actress relocated to Melbourne for filming and commented \"It's a great feeling to be rewarded with the role of Piper after years of hard work, especially when I fell in love with the character after my first audition.\"<ref name=\"Mavournee\"/> Ahead of her first appearance, the character was featured in a series of webisodes titled ''[[Hey Piper]]'', which see her talking to her family via online video calls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a668831/meet-piper-willis-neighbours-introduces-its-newest-regular-in-special-webisodes.html#~posY6mX4Yc6nHH|title=Meet Piper Willis: Neighbours introduces its newest regular in special webisodes|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=16 September 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref> Piper is the youngest daughter of [[Brad Willis (Neighbours)|Brad]] ([[Kip Gamblin]]) and [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]).

Dubbed the Cardcaptor by the cards' guardian Cerberus (better known as Kero-chan), Sakura must wield the Clow Staff to capture the card spirits and turn them back into cards for her use. Sakura is aided by her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, who creates battle costumes for her as well as videotaping her ventures as Cardcaptor; and later by Syaoran Li, a Chinese boy who is a direct descendant of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. The anime also introduced a fourth companion, Meiling Li, Syaoran's cousin. The rest of the characters are mostly oblivious to Sakura's magical life, aside from her brother Toya who has his own magical powers, and later Eriol Hiiragizawa, who is a reincarnated Clow Reed.\n\nThe anime was dubbed into English by [[Nelvana]] under the title of ''Cardcaptors'', with most of the character names changed to English ones with the exception of Sakura (repronounced as \"Sa-KU-ra\" instead of \"SA-ku-ra\" though), Meiling (slightly reduced in spelling as \"Meilin\"), Cerberus (repronounced as \"Keroberos\" based on the Japanese pronunciation of his name; \"Kero\" was repronounced as \"kir\u014d\" instead of \"ker\u014d\"), Mr. Terada, Wang Wei, Ruby Moon, Yue, and Clow Reed (\"Clow\" was repronounced as \"klau\u0307\" instead of \"kl\u014d\").\n\nA large number of the characters reappear as alternate selves in Clamp's other series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Main characters==\n<!-- http://ccsakura-official.com/intro/index2.html   for who are credited as main, listed generally in order of appearance -->\n\n===Sakura Kinomoto===\n{{main|Sakura Kinomoto}}\n{{nihongo|'''Sakura Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u3055\u304f\u3089|Kinomoto Sakura}} is the titular heroine of ''Cardcaptor Sakura,'' named after the Japanese word for \"[[cherry blossom]]\". Her most defining character traits are her unyielding determination, caring nature and loyalty to her friends. Sakura is portrayed as a perceptively sweet, extremely energetic and cheerful character who is well-loved, pretty, cheerful, cute and at times a na\u00efve, clumsy, and clueless. Sakura is athletically gifted and skilled in sports at school, being  an excellent runner and called the \"best baton twirler in school\" by her friends.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 1 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book''</ref> She hates math and is openly [[phasmophobia|phasmophobic]]. She has a big brother that is a [[wikt:babe magnet|chick magnet]]. Sakura maintains a crush on Yukito Tsukishiro for most of the manga and anime, but when she finally confesses to Yukito, she is gently rejected and she realizes that she loved him because of his resemblance to her father. Eventually, Sakura realizes she is actually in love with Syaoran, but doesn't realize her feelings until he first confesses his love for her. Although she fails to admit her feelings in the final episode, Sakura later manages to finally confess her love to Syaoran when he and Meiling return to visit in the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]''. However, in the Nelvana dub, they never develop their romance as it was heavily edited out.\n\nShe becomes the entitled Cardcaptor by guardian beast Cerberus after accidentally opening and releasing the Clow Cards from the Clow Book. Aided by Cerberus, her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, and later Syaoran, Sakura successfully captures all the cards and is named the new Clow Mistress by the cards' second guardian Yue (Yukito's true form).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 46 ''Sakura and the Final Judgment''</ref> In the second half of the manga and anime, Sakura must use the power of her own star to transform the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, or else the cards would lose their powers. In the beginning of the ''Clear Card'' arc, all the Sakura cards suddenly turn blank, losing their powers and while looking for a way to restore them, Sakura must capture new cards of an unknown origin that started appearing around town. She later learns that Syaoran was responsible for the Sakura cards' disappearance in a move to protect her, as her own power had grown too strong for her to control, leading to the creation of the Clear cards.\n\nFor all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by [[Sakura Tange]]. In the Animax English dub, she is voiced by Andrea Kwan. In the English dub of the [[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|second movie]], she is voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].<ref name=\"them ccs movie 2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=874 | title=Card Captor Sakura the Movie 2: The Sealed Card \u2013 Review | work=THEM Anime Reviews | accessdate=November 27, 2013 | last=Laeno | first=Dominic}}</ref> In the English dub of the ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|Clear Card]]'' arc, she is voiced by [[Monica Rial]], who reprised her role as Sakura from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-01-22/monica-rial-jason-liebrecht-return-for-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card-english-dub/.126791|title=Monica Rial, Jason Liebrecht Return for Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card English Dub|date=January 22, 2018|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the Nelvana English dub ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Sakura Avalon''', and is voiced by [[Carly McKillip]]. In this version, her initial romantic feelings for Yukito are removed, she is portrayed as a more thick-skinned and less sissy character than in the original anime, and she does not fall in love with Syaoran later in the series.\n\n===Cerberus {{anchor|Kero|Keroberos|Kero-chan}} ===\n<!-- Wikipedia uses the official English spelling from the manga, which is the primary work.

He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his \"brother\" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the Final Judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear.\n\nHaving spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in [[Osaka]], Cerberus speaks with a pointed [[Kansai dialect|Osakan-accent]].<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical and gluttonous, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger.

However, his master must have control of the Firey and Earthy cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged [[Cougar|mountain lion]]. In the anime adaptation, the Light card is changed to the Earthy card to delay his obtaining his true form.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Cerberus' name is taken from the [[Greek mythological]] figure, [[Cerberus]], a large three-headed dog who was assigned to guard the gates of the [[Greek underworld]]. In the bilingual Kodansha version of the manga, the name for Cerberus' borrowed form is Cero.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by [[Aya Hisakawa]], while his hidden form is voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is spelled Keroberos. His false form is voiced by [[Matt Hill]] with a New York accent, and [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] voices his true form, though the accent is not as distinct. In the second film, he is voiced by [[Wendee Lee]] and [[Dave Wittenberg]], in his respective forms. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Kero's false form is voiced by Mikaela Krantz and Kero's true form is voiced by [[Christopher Sabat]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/shows/cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card/|title=Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card English Cast & Crew|website=www.funimation.com|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\nCerberus appears in Episode 44 of ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'' in his borrowed form, although in the parallel world he dwells in it appears to be his singular body.<ref>''Tsubasa Chronicle'', Episode 44 ''Kero-chan and Mokona''</ref> Cerberus (using \"Kero\" as a nickname) guards the Country of Kero, and has a prophetic dream of Syaoran, Sakura, Fai, Kurogane and Mokona, the protagonists of ''Tsubasa'', arriving in his world and recruits Mokona to climb up a mountain to retrieve one of Sakura's memory feathers which shrinks down the protagonists in size.

Her most defining character traits is her attentiveness, integrity and selflessness towards Sakura's welfare. \n\nTomoyo is initially comes of as stereotypical \"Ojou-san\"; a demure and wealthy high-class female stock character. However, she is depicted as being emotionally matured, hard-working, highly motivated, compassionate, intelligent, meticulous; giving her a unique air of cultured politeness and refinement amongst the cast. She regularly speaks using more formal verb [[Japanese language|conjugations]] and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She is artistically gifted, having displayed talents as an amateur fashion designer, beautician, cinematographer, seamstress, choreographer and vocalist. Tomoyo is shown announcing, performing, or costume designing in various school events; in the anime, her musical ability causes her to be targeted by both the Voice and Song cards. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable perceptiveness, cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|The Sealed Card]]'' film.\n\nBecause Tomoyo lacks magical powers and athletic abilities, Sakura takes on a protective responsibility most times when capturing or transforming cards. If Tomoyo is ever in danger (or missing), Sakura will be the one concerned for her most, and her focus changes from that of the Card at hand to Tomoyo's safety. Fortunately, Sakura has always succeeded and hugs Tomoyo warmly whenever she reunites with her.\n\nTomoyo is notable for her crafty streak and obsession of documenting every single detail of Sakura's personal life on video as much as possible, much to Sakura's discomfort. When she learns of Sakura's new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear \"special outfits\", is responsible for choreographing Sakura's new action poses and begins providing Sakura with the various \"magical girl\" protective-costumes she wears during her captures, as well as accompanying her on magical (and non-magical) endeavors to record the events with her video camera. These \"art project\" seems to serve Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment than improving Sakura's performance. Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need.\n\nIn both the manga and anime adaptations, Tomoyo admits that she loves Sakura, but Sakura replies innocently, \"I love you, too,\" in the platonic sense. This is emphasized using manga conventions: Tomoyo declares her love against a background of flowers, while Sakura replies against a blank white background. In the manga, some scenes give the appearance that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura's brother Toya; however, according to Volume 1 of ''Clamp No Kiseki: The Ultimate Collection'', and an interview in the ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', this was an error caused by one of the finishing artists not being aware that CLAMP intended for Tomoyo to have romantic feelings for Sakura.<ref name=\"hawt\">interview printed in ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', published by Nakayoshi.</ref> Instead, she encourages Sakura's love of Yukito, and later becomes Syaoran's confidante and [[Wingman (social)|wingman]] when he begins to fall in love with Sakura.\n\nCLAMP stated that the reason that Sakura does not return her friend Tomoyo's feelings is not because Tomoyo is another girl, as Sakura does not consider sex or gender as barrier for her romantic attraction. She simply doesn't have romantic feelings for Tomoyo in particular.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Demonstrating this, Sakura confesses that she has a crush on a female teacher in the series.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nAlthough not the actual character, two of Tomoyo's alternate forms make an appearance in ''Cardcaptor Sakura''{{'}}s spiritual successor ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', three in the animated version.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, the character is voiced by [[Junko Iwao]].

His birthday is February 29. Though he teases her frequently, he cares a great deal for her and works to protect her. He is fully aware of what she is doing as a Cardcaptor, and regularly takes on several part-time jobs that put him in a position to be nearby when she is working on capturing a card. He disliked Syaoran and often holds a grudge against him but deep down he thought to himself that if there was someone Sakura should be with it would be Syaoran. Touya possesses several magical powers, including the ability to see ghosts and other non-humans, the ability to sense when Sakura is in danger, and mild [[precognition]]. He has an extremely close relationship with his best friend [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito]], despite knowing he is the alter-ego of Yue. To save both Yukito and Yue, Touya becomes a normal human being after he gives all of his magical powers to Yue, making him promise to protect Sakura in his stead as well as himself (and, by extension, Yukito).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 65 ''Sakura, Yukito, and the Vanishing Power''</ref> However, it has been revealed in the last chapter of ''Clear Card'' arc that he is gradually regaining his magic and seems to be developing new and greater abilities that he shall reveal until the time is right. \n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Touya is voiced by [[Tomokazu Seki]]. In the English manga his name is spelled \"Toya\". In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', his name is changed to '''Tori Avalon''' and he is voiced by [[Tony Sampson]]. In the English dub of the second film, [[Kirk Thornton]] takes over the voicing role. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Touya is voiced by [[Clifford Chapin]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yukito Tsukishiro / Yue {{anchor|Yukito Tsukishiro|Yue}} ===\nYue/Yukito are a [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]: Yukito is a \"false\" persona created to mask Yue's \"true\" identity. For most of the series, Yue remained in a \"[[Hibernation|state of hibernation]]\"; Yukito is unaware of Yue's existence, though he maintains an enormous appetite for food in an unconscious attempt to give Yue power. Yue's existence is revealed to the other characters after all of the Clow Cards are collected, and Toya states he knew of Yue's existence all along and was just waiting for Yukito to notice himself.\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yukito Tsukishiro'''|\u6708\u57ce \u96ea\u514e|Tsukishiro Yukito|nicknamed 'Yuki' by Toya, and 'Yuki-usagi' by Kerberus}} is the best friend of Sakura's older brother, Touya, and the human alter-ego of the Clow Card guardian, [[#Yue|Yue]]. Though he is certainly Yue's \"temporary form\", he is referenced several times by other characters (including Eriol and Yue himself) as being simultaneously a completely separate \"heart\" from Yue's \"true form\". As Yukito, he displays a kind and gentle nature, and at the start of the series, Sakura develops a strong [[limerence]] towards him. When she confessed her feelings, he gently rejects her, as the one he loves most is Touya.\n\n:Once Sakura collects all of the cards, Yue begins needing greater power as her magic isn't strong enough to sustain him. Subconsciously, Yukito begins eating even more to try to compensate, but it is not enough and he starts sleeping constantly, even while standing, and eventually finds his body fading away altogether. Once Touya gives his magical energy to Yue to sustain them, Yukito begins to grow aware of Yue's existence; the grandparents with whom Yukito thought he lived were a false memory and thus did not exist. It is suggested that he came into existence shortly before he met Touya, to be near the future new guardian of the Clow Cards. Eriol tells Yue that while he (and Clow) did know Sakura was predestined to be the future master of the cards, and had predicted that both Sakura and Yue would be [[Romance (love)|romantically involved]] with each other; however, Yukito had deviated from this prophetic vision by [[falling in love]] with Touya.\n\n:In the Japanese anime adaptation Yukito is voiced by [[Megumi Ogata]]. In ''Cardcaptors'', Yukito's name is changed to '''Julian Star''', his love for Touya is removed, and he is voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Steve Staley]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Yukito is voiced by [[Justin Briner]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yue'''|\u6708|extra=[[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Pinyin]]: ''Yu\u00e8''}} is the one of two Guardians of the Clow Cards, along with Cerberus. His name, which is written in ''[[kanji]]'' rather than ''[[hiragana]]'' is the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word for \"moon\". Whereas Cerberus is the elector of the new Clow Card Master, Yue is the judge who is allowed to test the candidate for their worthiness. He spends most of the series in his temporary form, [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]], who initially has no memory or knowledge of his other self. Unlike Cerberus, Yue's powers are heavily dependent on the power of his master. Sakura's power is not yet strong enough to sustain him after he awakens, particularly after she begins transforming the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards. Yue's growing need for power is reflected in Yukito's ravenous appetite and later constant sleeping. Similarly, the deficit affects Yue himself in instances such as the blatant failure of his magic which causes he and Sakura to fall out of the sky during one of Eriol's synthesized 'situations'. Eventually, Sakura's brother Toya reveals that he knows Yue and Yukito are not human and gives his power to Yue to sustain his existence so he does not lose Yukito.\n\n:As with [[Ruby Moon]], Yue's \"true form\" has no biological sex or gender; though not \"human or male\", Yue has the appearance of a [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] beautiful \"angelic-[[bish\u014dnen]]\" young man (male pronouns used) with long, silver, braided hair, silver-purple feline eyes, and a pair of white angel wings which he uses for flight. Yue sports a white suit and spats-like coverings on his feet. His personality is depicted as serious and aloof in contrast to Yukito's, and while Yukito is fond of Sakura, Yue is reluctant to accept her. As the series progress, he comes to respond to Sakura's request that rather than being his master, she just wants to be his friend. Yue has jurisdiction over the elements wind and water, though he is stated by Cerberus to have control over other cards, including the Wood, Time and Dark.\n\n:{{anime voices2|Yue|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]|type=tv}} In the English dub of the second anime film, his voice is provided by [[Steve Staley]].

As such, he initially rivals against Sakura because he believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards and tries to capture the cards for himself. As the series progresses, however, Syaoran comes to respect Sakura and becomes her friend and ally. He eventually falls in love with her, though she is slow to realize it due to her own feelings for Yukito.\n\nOriginally, Syaoran appeared [[Infatuation|smitten]] with Yukito, but later revealed that the attraction was due to high moon power inside of Yukito. Eventually, in the beginning of the third season, Syaoran finally begins to realize he has deeply fallen in love with Sakura, as he constantly blushes whenever he is around her.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 47 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Transfer Student''</ref> In the manga, Syaoran begins to develop feelings for Sakura around the time of the Erase Card's capture. Once Syaoran realizes his feelings, he tries to admit his love for Sakura several times, but is both too nervous to confess his feelings while also being constantly interrupted. Syaoran also becomes extremely jealous whenever he sees Sakura spending time with Eriol, believing he harbours romantic feelings for Sakura and considers him a rival. Syaoran's love for Sakura is proven to be really strong as he thinks strongly of her well being and needs before his own as shown when after Yukito rejects Sakura's feelings, Syaoran comforts her even though Sakura is still unaware about his own romantic feelings towards her. Nearing the end of the series, Syaoran finally confesses his feelings to Sakura, but decides to return to [[Hong Kong]], since Sakura has now become the new master of the cards.\n\nIn the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]'', he and Meiling return from Hong Kong a few months later to visit. Throughout the movie, Syaoran waits for Sakura to reply to his confession, but as Sakura constantly keeps trying to tell him how she feels, they are repeatedly interrupted. Syaoran and Sakura work together to defeat the Nothing Card that has been secretly stealing the Sakura cards while making parts of Tomoeda disappear. Eventually at the end of the movie, they manage to defeat the Nothing Card, which becomes the Hope Card and Sakura finally confesses her love for Syaoran and jumps into his arms.\n\nTwo years later, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda and enrolls at the same middle school as Sakura and most of her friends. However, his true objective is to watch over Sakura and help her with the mystery surrounding the Clear Cards. He also keeps contact with Eriol, who instructs him to not interfere until the time is right. Later he reveals to Sakura that he was the one who took away the spirits contained within the Sakura Cards in order to protect herself from her own power, which is growing out of control, thus leading to the creation of the Clear Cards. Despite intending to reveal all the truth to Sakura, Syaoran becomes unable to tell her anything about Akiho or Kaito's involvement due to a spell Kaito placed on him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Syaoran manages to catch several cards by playing a major role in helping Sakura seal them. He is allowed to attempt the final judgment but fails. Syaoran is shown to have similar powers to Sakura, such as sensing Clow Cards and magical auras, is a skilled martial artist, and wields a sword which he can use to cast spells when equipped with incantation papers. He can also use a device (dubbed a \"[[wiktionary:\u7f85\u91dd\u76e4|lasenboard]]\" in ''Cardcaptors''<ref>''Cardcaptors'', Episode 8 ''Sakura's Rival''</ref>), which can detect and direct him to magical entities. A running gag is Kero calling him \"kid\".\n\nIn Japanese media, Syaoran is voiced by [[Motoko Kumai]]. In the second movie, he is voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Jason Liebrecht]], who reprised his role as Syaoran from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Nelvana's English dub ''Cardcaptors'', his full name is switched around as '''Li Showron''', and is voiced by [[Rhys Huber]] during the Clow Cards arc and the first movie, and Jordan Kilik in the Sakura Cards arc. He is introduced as the male lead in the first episode of the dub (episode 8 of the original anime), is also called a \"Cardcaptor\", his feelings for Yukito were replaced with shyness, and is more abrasive and blunt than in the original anime. In the dub as well for Sakura, Syaoran never told his feelings towards Sakura as he did in episode 69, one episode before the finale.\n\n===Meiling Li===\n'''Meiling Li''' (\u674e\u8393\u9234 ''L\u01d0 M\u00e9il\u00edng'', \u30ea\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3 ''Ri Meirin'', Cantonese Jyutping: ''lei5 mui4 ling4''), is [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]'s cousin and fianc\u00e9e, and only appears in the anime adaptation of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Introduced towards the end of episode 19, she is a very impulsive, bratty, straightforward, clingy, and overconfident girl. As children living in Hong Kong, Meiling and Syaoran trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from its cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked Syaoran above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged, much to Syaoran's chagrin. At the same time, she promised that if he found someone he liked more than her, he would tell her and she would release him from the promise.<ref>Ep 43<!-- proper ref later --></ref>\n\nIn coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran find and gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43 by her mother due to unknown reasons. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she acknowledges and accepts Sakura  as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep her promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and her. She releases Syaoran from their promise, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at [[#Tomoyo Daid\u014dji|Tomoyo Daid\u014dji]]'s house and releases all of her frustration by crying without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, to see her old friends, but secretly came back to help Sakura finally confess her love to Syaoran. Meiling also occasionally appears in the anime adaptation of ''Clear Card'', talking to Sakura on phone and giving her hints at developing her relationship with Syaoran. A running gag is Kero calling her \"brat\".\n\nAlong with her temporary stay in Tomoeda and being supportive of Syaoran, Meiling also plays a limited role in the story because, unlike Syaoran, she has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers and tendency to leap before thinking, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style.<!-- ep 43 -->\n\nIn ''Clear Card'' episode 13, Meiling matured and is much less of a brat than she used to be. Even Sakura is amazed to see Meiling speak so politely to Fujitaka, to which Meiling responds, \u201cIt\u2019s just good manners,\u201d as if that's how she's always been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/04/23/meiling-is-the-most-delightful-surprise-in-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card|title=Meiling is the Most Delightful Surprise in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMeiling sports an [[Odango (hairstyle)|odango hairstyle]] on every episode that she is in.\n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Meiling is voiced by [[Yukana|Yukana Nogami]].

Her unrequited engagement with Syaoran was omitted along with the fact that she and Syaoran were cousins.

Along with Kohaku of ''[[Wish (manga)|Wish]],'' and Yuuko of ''[[xxxHolic]],'' he is one of the few Clamp-created characters to appear in more than one work.\n\nBorn of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications. However, few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life, though multiple characters comment on his eccentricity. He displays a gentle and affable personality in his interactions with his creations.\n\nWhen Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then-unborn descendant [[Sakura Kinomoto]] to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. Likewise, he deliberately made the sealing wand pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl.<!-- Ep 46 of anime; vol 6 manga --> He also split his soul into two reincarnations: [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] who had all of his memories and magic, and [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka Kinomoto]], Sakura's father. In the anime adaptation, Clow does not split his soul, instead passing on his memories, soul, and powers to Eriol exclusively. Syaoran Li is also an indirect descendant of Clow's Chinese lineage.\n\nIn the anime adaptation and the film, he is voiced by [[Kazuo Hayashi]]. In the English adaptation, ''Cardcaptors'', he is voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]. Clow Reed also appears in two additional CLAMP works, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', where he has another descendant named [[Fei-Wang Reed]] and worked with the Dimensional Witch [[Y\u016bko Ichihara]] in arranging the series of events in the former series.\n\n===Fujitaka Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Fujitaka Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u85e4\u9686|Kinomoto Fujitaka}} is the father of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and her brother Touya Kinomoto. A busy professor of [[archaeology]] at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko]] while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that \"an angel has fallen from the sky.\" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning.\n\nLittle is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul (seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world), he split it into two halves. One of these halves became [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]], holding all of Clow's magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other Clow's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by [[Hideyuki Tanaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is changed to '''Aiden Avalon''' and he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Scott Evans. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Fujitaka is voiced by [[Jason Douglas]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Sonomi Daidouji===\n{{nihongo|'''Sonomi Daidouji'''|\u5927\u9053\u5bfa \u5712\u7f8e|Daid\u014dji Sonomi}} is the mother of titular character Sakura's best friend [[#Tomoyo Daidouji|Tomoyo Daidouji]], and the first cousin of Sakura's late mother [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko Kinomoto]]. She is rarely seen in the series, but is said to be a wealthy woman and the President of a large toy corporation. She greatly loved her cousin Nadeshiko, and disapproved of her marriage to Fujitaka, later blaming Fujitaka for Nadeshiko's death at a young age. During the marriage, it is implied that Nadeshiko was at least partially cut off from her family. Sonomi maintains a [[pixie cut]], a hairstyle Nadeshiko loved giving her when they were kids; and has Tomoyo keep her hair long because it reminds her of Nadeshiko.\n\nAfter meeting Sakura for the first time, Sonomi realizes that Nadeshiko had lived a happy life and is able to come to terms with the marriage. At times, she still treats Fujitaka as a \"rival\" competing to love Nadeshiko more, but she also helps him pass on gifts from Sakura to her grandfather and to arrange for Sakura to meet her great-grandfather while on a family vacation. Sonomi shows great affection for Sakura\u2013treating her like her own daughter\u2013and often clears her busy work schedule to join her and Tomoyo whenever Sakura comes over to visit.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, her name is changed to '''Samantha Taylor''' and her declaration of love for Nadeshiko is modified to a purely familiar love rather than a romantic love.\n\nSonomi is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]] in anime series. She is voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub and by [[Wendee Lee]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Michelle Rojas]].\n\n===Nadeshiko Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Nadeshiko Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c [[wiktionary:\u64ab\u5b50|\u64ab\u5b50]]|Kinomoto Nadeshiko}} is Sakura and Toya's mother, Fujitaka's late wife, and the first cousin of [[#Sonomi Daidouji|Sonomi Daidouji]]. She worked as a model from her teens up until her death. She was sixteen when she met Fujitaka when he worked as a student teacher at her high school. She met Fujitaka when she climbed a tree to rescue a bird nest and accidentally fell, and landed on him as he saved her from getting hurt. He then remarked, \"l had thought an angel fell from the sky\". With those words, she fell in love with him. Soon after, against the wishes of her family, they got married despite their nine-year age gap (he was 25, she was 16). She died from an unnamed illness when Sakura was three. Because she was 27 when she died and Sakura was three and Toya was eight, it is likely that she gave birth to Toya at 19. Although she has died, she is still very much remembered and loved by her family; Fujitaka keeps her picture in the family room and Sakura never fails to greet her photo every morning. She appears occasionally as a spirit and is seen only by Toya, Eriol, and Sakura (beginning with volume 4 of the Clear Card arc).\n\nNadeshiko is voiced by [[Y\u016bko Minaguchi]] in the anime series.  In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaption, her name is changed to '''Natasha Avalon''' and she is voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Megan Shipman.\n\n===Yoshiyuki Terada===\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshiyuki Terada'''|\u5bfa\u7530 \u826f\u5e78|Terada Yoshiyuki}} is a [[teacher]] at Tomoeda Elementary School. During the series, as the main characters go through fourth grade, and enter the fifth grade, he acts as their home room teacher. He is also shown teaching in other classes, including the [[physical education]] classes, and he acts as the chaperon on several school field trips. As the series progresses, it is revealed that he is having a romantic relationship with his student [[#Rika Sasaki|Rika Sasaki]]. In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Syaoran, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out \"Sensei\" (teacher) when she uses the Illusion card to show Rika her most beloved.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his \"hardest working student.\" In the ''Cardcaptors'' English dub, he is simply called '''Mr. Terada''', and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings.\n\nIn the anime series, he is voiced by [[T\u014dru Furusawa]] for the first season and first movie, and by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] for the second and third seasons and the second film. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. He is voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Zach Bolton]].\n\n===Rika Sasaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Rika Sasaki'''|\u4f50\u3005\u6728 \u5229\u4f73|Sasaki Rika}} is a classmate and friend of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]]. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved (or greatest fear in the English dub), allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card.\n\nDuring the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher [[#Yoshiyuki Terada|Yoshiyuki Terada]]. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on \"dates.\" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another (it's implied that he reminds her of her father, who's oft busy on overseas business). Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks induced by the Sword card, she calls the image \"Sensei\" which means \"teacher\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look.\n\nAfter graduating from Elementary School, Rika is the only among Sakura's friends who enrolled in a different Junior High School, and thus is not seen with them in ''Clear Card'', although they usually keep in touch.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, Rika's name is changed to '''Rita''' and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed. Instead of being a good student, she is depicted as having trouble with her school work and her blushing around Terada is explained away as being embarrassed at having to stay after school so often and that she is afraid of him.\n\nIn the original anime series, she is voiced by [[Tomoko Kawakami]]. In the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Saki Fujita]]. In the English dub of the second film, she is voiced by [[Dina Sherman|Stevie Bloch]].

He is infamously known for fabricating highly detailed stories on the supposed history of practically any subject, usually whatever Sakura and her friends happening to be discussing.  Sakura and Syaoran are often gullible enough to believe the stories, which often provide an element of humour in the series.  His stories are primarily interrupted by Chiharu, who physically disciplines him by strangling him until he stops talking and will resort to dragging him away when she proves to be unsuccessful.  His storytelling is later supplemented by Eriol, who helps to reinforce the false validity of his stories and whose presence prevents Chiharu from stopping Yamazaki's lies.  Notably, Yamazaki's eyes are almost never open, causing Meiling to hypothesize that he only opens his eyes when telling the truth, a hypothesis that is later proven false.\n\nWhile generally viewed as lighthearted and energetic, Yamazaki can also be sensitive and serious. In the last volume of the manga, when Sakura was down, he leaves the scene in order for Chiharu to talk to Sakura. Chiharu adds that he understands that Sakura needs her guidance and counseling, which is why he left so they could talk rather than stay to tell stories.\n\nYamazaki is named after film director, [[Takashi Yamazaki (film director)|Takashi Yamazaki]], who is a friend of CLAMP.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  He is known as '''Zachary Marker''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'' and his relationship with Chiharu is written so that they are cousins and her acts of strangling are the result of [[sibling rivalry]].

He is voiced by Philip Pacaud in the English ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Joshua Seth]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Takashi is voiced by Alejandro Saab.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Chiharu Mihara===\n{{nihongo|'''Chiharu Mihara'''|\u4e09\u539f \u5343\u6625|Mihara Chiharu}} is one of Sakura Kinomoto's friends and classmates in school.  Along with Rika Sasaki and Naoko Yanagisawa, Chiharu often appears alongside Sakura at school and during school events. She is also on the school's cheerleading squad with Sakura.  Chiharu's most notable trait is her relationship with Takashi Yamazaki, whom she has known since kindergarten.<ref>\"Sakura's Scary Test of Courage\" (Episode 17). ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. 1998. CLAMP, NHK.</ref>  She is never fooled by his rampant storytelling and is usually driven silence him by comically strangling him, which usually does not prevent him from continuing. Despite the rough-handling, she and Yamazaki actually share a close relationship and it is implied that they care for one another in a more affectionate manner. In the last volume of the series, Chiharu speaks openly about her relationship with Yamazaki when Sakura turns to her for advice on love and true feelings as Sakura reflects on her own relationship with Syaoran.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, she is known as '''Chelsea''' and Yamazaki is written as her cousin to justify the random acts of strangling as sibling rivalry.\n\nIn the Japanese version, she is voiced by [[Miwa Matsumoto]]. She is voiced by [[Jocelyne Loewen]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] in the second movie.

Despite being bad at gymnastics, she is also a member of the school's cheerleading squad alongside Sakura.\n\nNaoko loves reading various types of stories, especially fantasy stories and ghost stories. While Sakura reacts to scary situations with utmost fear, Naoko reacts with fascination and a brave willingness to explore these mysterious situations further.  In the anime, Naoko's love of stories causes trouble when she finds ''The Create'' card in the form of a notebook and writes a fantastic story within it, forcing Sakura to defeat Naoko's creations before recovering ''The Create''.  When Naoko wakes up the next morning to find her book suddenly missing, she believes she just had a supernatural experience.\n\nShe is known as '''Nikki''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors''.

Initially objecting to Nadeshiko's marriage to Fujitaka Kinomoto, he became more accepting upon meeting Sakura and later receiving a gift from her as a form of peace between family members. In the episode, ''Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories'', Sakura doesn't know who he was and they spent a good time together, playing tennis, having tea, Sakura giving him cookies and Masaki giving Sakura the dress her mother wore. Just before leaving, Sakura used the Rain card to make a rainbow for Masaki, prompting him to remember when Nadeshiko had first pointed out a rainbow to him. Sakura discovers the present Masaki left her was the dress she wore at his summer house, although she does not seem to realizes who he actually is despite Cerberus pointing out its origins.\n\nMasaki later appears in ''Clear Card'', inviting Sakura and Syaoran for another visit to his summer house. In the occasion, he presents Sakura with a mysterious key that once belonged to her mother, and later states that he intends is to have Sakura inherit the summer house itself after he passes away.\n\nIn the anime series, Masaki is voiced by [[Osamu Saka]]. In the English dub, '''Mr. Avalon''' was portrayed instead as the father of Natasha Avalon, making him the grandfather of Sakura instead of her great-grandfather. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Masaki is voiced by Charlie Campbell.\n\n===Kaho Mizuki===\n{{nihongo|'''Kaho Mizuki'''|\u89b3\u6708 \u6b4c\u5e06|Mizuki Kaho}} is a [[miko|shrine maiden]] and the daughter of the priest at the Tsukimine Shrine. She first appears in the series as a new substitute teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School for the math class of [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]. While Sakura instantly [[Puppy love|crushes]] on the female teacher and feels a connection with her, Syaoran is distrustful and believes she is up to no good.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nWhen Sakura, Syaoran, Meiling and Tomoyo are trapped by the Maze card, Kaho uses a mysterious bell to break through Maze's walls allowing Sakura to capture it. After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura's older brother Toya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true.\n\nAfter meeting her, [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian [[#Yue|Yue]], which is later shown to actually be [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]]. Kaho's role is to use the bell left at her family's shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura's staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England. During the third season of the series, she is primarily \"seen\" through providing a steady, but oftentimes enigmatic exchange of letters with Sakura over the mysterious attacks. After [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] reveals the truth behind the attacks, they learn that Kaho had met Eriol three years before Sakura discovered the Book of the Clow. As they leave for England, Kaho and Eriol confirm their feelings for one another and vow to remain together. She is later seen beside Eriol on a few occasions in both the second movie and the ''Clear Card'' arc.\n\nIn the anime series, Kaho is voiced by [[Emi Shinohara]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', her name is changed to '''Layla MacKenzie''' and she is voiced by [[Linda Rae Jurgens]]. She is voiced by [[Philece Sampler]] in the English adaptation of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Kaho is voiced by [[Morgan Garrett]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Eriol Hiragizawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Eriol Hiragizawa'''|\u67ca\u6ca2 \u30a8\u30ea\u30aa\u30eb|H\u012bragizawa Erioru}} is the principal antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the ''Master of the Clow'' arc. The reincarnation of [[Clow Reed]], Eriol has both Clow's memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed's, can restrain Clow's creations Yue and Cerberus, and has created his own similar pair of guardians: [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]] and [[#Spinel Sun|Spinel Sun]]. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after [[Sakura Kinomoto]] passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate [[#Takashi Yamazaki|Takashi Yamazaki]] in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him, mainly due to that Eriol is overly nice to Sakura which makes Syaoran jealous. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories of encountering him after he is accidentally seen by him.\n\nEriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to \"feed\" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying.\n\nSakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are forcing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be changed together. After Sakura successfully does so, he then tells her that she is now more powerful than Clow Reed and asks her to perform one final task for him: to divide his own magical power between himself and her father [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka]]\u2014the other reincarnation of Clow Reed\u2014so that Eriol will no longer be the most powerful magician in the world. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have been dangerous for Sakura.\n\nEriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with [[#Kaho Mizuki|Kaho Mizuki]], whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. At the end of the manga series, she returns with him to England, and in the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice, though their love is never confessed like in the manga, only hinted at indirectly. In the ''Clear Card'' arc. Eriol ceases all contact with Sakura after the Sakura cards turn blank, but keeps in touch with Syaoran who informs him about everything that happens around her. While questioned about his reasons, Eriol claims that he is waiting for the right time to interfere, and thus forbids both Syaoran and his companions in England from taking action until then.\n\nIn the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than him giving an invitation.\n\nThe character of Eriol is voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, his name is changed to '''Eli Moon''' and he is voiced by [[Bill Switzer]]. In the English dub of the second film, his voice is supplied by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].

The counterpart to Clow Reed's original guardian Kerberus. Spinel Sun's true form is a [[butterfly]]-winged [[black panther]] with cat-like ears and ruffs of fur on the side of his head, while his false form is similar to a small [[winged cat]] with the same wing type as his true form. Nicknamed Suppi by [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]], Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form (though this encounter is exclusive to the anime). Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares Spinel Sun a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn him into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enables him to defeat him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] in his true form, and by [[Yumi T\u014dma]] in his false form.

Her true form resembles a human-sized [[fairy]] that performs ruby-based attacks. Ruby Moon is [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] and has no biological sex, but prefers feminine pronouns; her \"human sex\" is unspecified, though Akizuki has stated a preference for women's clothing and enjoys \"[[Kawaii|being cute]]\".\n\nUnlike the Yue/Yukito relationship, both Ruby/Nakuru forms are fully aware and display no [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]. As the alias, Nakuru Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Toya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter's dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Toya's energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn't simply steal it. When Toya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue's life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to Yue's greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Ruby Moon is voiced by [[Ry\u014dka Yuzuki]].

She is a young girl who bears a strong resemblance to Sakura, being around the same age and height. Akiho is rarely seen without her stuffed rabbit Momo, which she has owned since she was a small child.\n\nAkiho makes her first appearance in chapter 7 of the ''Clear Card'' arc as a transfer student in Sakura and Tomoyo's class. Akiho used to live in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[England]], and [[Hong Kong]] before moving to Japan, and is initially shy around her classmates due to her nervousness about speaking Japanese. Akiho is gifted at singing and, with Tomoyo and Sakura's encouragement, joins the school choir club.\n\nAkiho lives with her caretaker Yuna D. Kaito in Eriol's old house. She tells Sakura that Yuna has cared for her since she was very young, and suggests that she is distant from her blood relatives. Many of Akiho's relatives are avid [[Bibliophilia|book collectors]] who travel the world in search of rare books. Akiho's family installed its massive library of books in her house, among them one of her most prized possessions, a novel titled \"Alice in Clockland\" written in a foreign script only she can read. Akiho states that she has moved from country to country for most of her life in search of a particular book. When it became apparent that for some unknown reason Akiho and Sakura have shared dreams, it was revealed that Akiho not only possesses strong magic abilities, she is also the figure in the robe that continuously confronted Sakura in her dreams, although Akiho herself doesn't know that, however as Sakura and Akiho continue to enter the same dream, Akiho develops a knowledge of why she is present in those dreams: the mysterious person she is watching has something she wants.\n\nLater is revealed that Akiho is part of the \"D\" magician clan, but despite having born from the two most powerful magicians of the clan at the time, she has no magic power at all, thus the clan decides to use her to create the ultimate magic tool by implanting all kinds of spells inside her body, despite knowing that it would destroy her soul, until Kaito takes her with him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Akiho Shinomoto is voiced by [[Minori Suzuki]] in Japanese and [[AmaLee|Amanda Lee]] in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yuna D.

Yuna is a tall, dark-haired young man who appears dressed in full formal uniform, including an unusual pocket watch which he holds dear. He is professional and polite in his interactions with others, and is skilled at various domestic tasks including baking and sewing.\n\nSyaoran senses that Yuna possesses strong [[moon magic]], and Eriol confirms that the \"D.\" in Yuna's name is a title from a notorious English wizarding society. Yuna appears to be aware of both the existence of the Clear Cards and the fact that Sakura is a magician.  Thus-far, it has been hinted that he's after the Clear Cards as a means of powering a certain spell, possibly connected to a magical object, a magical time-controlling pocket watch (mentioned above), which he had stolen from the society of sorcerers he was formally-apart of, and that he's using both Sakura and Akiho to get them (having some-how created a connection between then before they had even met, which is evident by them sharing the same reoccurring dreams but are completely oblivious that they have been seeing one another), but that the ones that Sakura has created so far are not yet enough for his purpose to activate that certain spell of the ancient, forbidden relic that he had taken from the magic association from which he was excommunicated. As such, he turns back time but is certain that Sakura may gradually recall what had occurred between her and the cloaked figure, finally uncovering its identity as her good friend Akiho.\n\nIn the incomplete anime adaptation, Yuna D.

However she was eventually revealed to be actually a magical creature much like Kero and Spinel, but while Akiho is unaware of this, Yuna is the only one who has been seen to communicate with Momo as of yet.

Dubbed the Cardcaptor by the cards' guardian Cerberus (better known as Kero-chan), Sakura must wield the Clow Staff to capture the card spirits and turn them back into cards for her use. Sakura is aided by her best friend Tomoyo Daidouji, who creates battle costumes for her as well as videotaping her ventures as Cardcaptor; and later by Syaoran Li, a Chinese boy who is a direct descendant of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. The anime also introduced a fourth companion, Meiling Li, Syaoran's cousin. The rest of the characters are mostly oblivious to Sakura's magical life, aside from her brother Toya who has his own magical powers, and later Eriol Hiiragizawa, who is a reincarnated Clow Reed.\n\nThe anime was dubbed into English by [[Nelvana]] under the title of ''Cardcaptors'', with most of the character names changed to English ones with the exception of Sakura (repronounced as \"Sa-KU-ra\" instead of \"SA-ku-ra\" though), Meiling (slightly reduced in spelling as \"Meilin\"), Cerberus (repronounced as \"Keroberos\" based on the Japanese pronunciation of his name; \"Kero\" was repronounced as \"kir\u014d\" instead of \"ker\u014d\"), Mr. Terada, Wang Wei, Ruby Moon, Yue, and Clow Reed (\"Clow\" was repronounced as \"klau\u0307\" instead of \"kl\u014d\").\n\nA large number of the characters reappear as alternate selves in Clamp's other series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Main characters==\n<!-- http://ccsakura-official.com/intro/index2.html   for who are credited as main, listed generally in order of appearance -->\n\n===Sakura Kinomoto===\n{{main|Sakura Kinomoto}}\n{{nihongo|'''Sakura Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u3055\u304f\u3089|Kinomoto Sakura}} is the titular heroine of ''Cardcaptor Sakura,'' named after the Japanese word for \"[[cherry blossom]]\". Her most defining character traits are her unyielding determination, caring nature and loyalty to her friends. Sakura is portrayed as a perceptively sweet, extremely energetic and cheerful character who is well-loved, pretty, cheerful, cute and at times a na\u00efve, clumsy, and clueless. Sakura is athletically gifted and skilled in sports at school, being  an excellent runner and called the \"best baton twirler in school\" by her friends.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 1 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Magic Book''</ref> She hates math and is openly [[phasmophobia|phasmophobic]]. She has a big brother that is a [[wikt:babe magnet|chick magnet]]. Sakura maintains a crush on Yukito Tsukishiro for most of the manga and anime, but when she finally confesses to Yukito, she is gently rejected and she realizes that she loved him because of his resemblance to her father. Eventually, Sakura realizes she is actually in love with Syaoran, but doesn't realize her feelings until he first confesses his love for her. Although she fails to admit her feelings in the final episode, Sakura later manages to finally confess her love to Syaoran when he and Meiling return to visit in the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]''. However, in the Nelvana dub, they never develop their romance as it was heavily edited out.\n\nShe becomes the entitled Cardcaptor by guardian beast Cerberus after accidentally opening and releasing the Clow Cards from the Clow Book. Aided by Cerberus, her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, and later Syaoran, Sakura successfully captures all the cards and is named the new Clow Mistress by the cards' second guardian Yue (Yukito's true form).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 46 ''Sakura and the Final Judgment''</ref> In the second half of the manga and anime, Sakura must use the power of her own star to transform the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, or else the cards would lose their powers. In the beginning of the ''Clear Card'' arc, all the Sakura cards suddenly turn blank, losing their powers and while looking for a way to restore them, Sakura must capture new cards of an unknown origin that started appearing around town. She later learns that Syaoran was responsible for the Sakura cards' disappearance in a move to protect her, as her own power had grown too strong for her to control, leading to the creation of the Clear cards.\n\nFor all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by [[Sakura Tange]]. In the Animax English dub, she is voiced by Andrea Kwan. In the English dub of the [[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|second movie]], she is voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].<ref name=\"them ccs movie 2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=874 | title=Card Captor Sakura the Movie 2: The Sealed Card \u2013 Review | work=THEM Anime Reviews | accessdate=November 27, 2013 | last=Laeno | first=Dominic}}</ref> In the English dub of the ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|Clear Card]]'' arc, she is voiced by [[Monica Rial]], who reprised her role as Sakura from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-01-22/monica-rial-jason-liebrecht-return-for-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card-english-dub/.126791|title=Monica Rial, Jason Liebrecht Return for Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card English Dub|date=January 22, 2018|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the Nelvana English dub ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Sakura Avalon''', and is voiced by [[Carly McKillip]].

He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his \"brother\" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the Final Judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear.\n\nHaving spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in [[Osaka]], Cerberus speaks with a pointed [[Kansai dialect|Osakan-accent]].<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical and gluttonous, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger.

However, his master must have control of the Firey and Earthy cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged [[Cougar|mountain lion]]. In the anime adaptation, the Light card is changed to the Earthy card to delay his obtaining his true form.<ref name=\"Animerica\" /> Cerberus' name is taken from the [[Greek mythological]] figure, [[Cerberus]], a large three-headed dog who was assigned to guard the gates of the [[Greek underworld]]. In the bilingual Kodansha version of the manga, the name for Cerberus' borrowed form is Cero.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by [[Aya Hisakawa]], while his hidden form is voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is spelled Keroberos. His false form is voiced by [[Matt Hill]] with a New York accent, and [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]] voices his true form, though the accent is not as distinct. In the second film, he is voiced by [[Wendee Lee]] and [[Dave Wittenberg]], in his respective forms.

The daughter of the president of [[Daid\u014dji family|Daid\u014dji]] Toy Company, Sonomi Daidoji,<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 10 ''Sakura and the Sports Day of Flowers''</ref> Tomoyo lives a life of wealth and is watched over by a team of female maids and bodyguards.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 2 ''Sakura's Wonderful Friend''</ref> She has access to a variety of [[state of the art]] [[prototype]] technological gadgets from her mother's company, and supplies Sakura and Cerberus with different [[mobile device]]s throughout the series. Her most defining character traits is her attentiveness, integrity and selflessness towards Sakura's welfare. \n\nTomoyo is initially comes of as stereotypical \"Ojou-san\"; a demure and wealthy high-class female stock character. However, she is depicted as being emotionally matured, hard-working, highly motivated, compassionate, intelligent, meticulous; giving her a unique air of cultured politeness and refinement amongst the cast. She regularly speaks using more formal verb [[Japanese language|conjugations]] and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She is artistically gifted, having displayed talents as an amateur fashion designer, beautician, cinematographer, seamstress, choreographer and vocalist. Tomoyo is shown announcing, performing, or costume designing in various school events; in the anime, her musical ability causes her to be targeted by both the Voice and Song cards. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable perceptiveness, cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card|The Sealed Card]]'' film.\n\nBecause Tomoyo lacks magical powers and athletic abilities, Sakura takes on a protective responsibility most times when capturing or transforming cards. If Tomoyo is ever in danger (or missing), Sakura will be the one concerned for her most, and her focus changes from that of the Card at hand to Tomoyo's safety. Fortunately, Sakura has always succeeded and hugs Tomoyo warmly whenever she reunites with her.\n\nTomoyo is notable for her crafty streak and obsession of documenting every single detail of Sakura's personal life on video as much as possible, much to Sakura's discomfort. When she learns of Sakura's new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear \"special outfits\", is responsible for choreographing Sakura's new action poses and begins providing Sakura with the various \"magical girl\" protective-costumes she wears during her captures, as well as accompanying her on magical (and non-magical) endeavors to record the events with her video camera. These \"art project\" seems to serve Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment than improving Sakura's performance. Tomoyo faithfully keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need.\n\nIn both the manga and anime adaptations, Tomoyo admits that she loves Sakura, but Sakura replies innocently, \"I love you, too,\" in the platonic sense. This is emphasized using manga conventions: Tomoyo declares her love against a background of flowers, while Sakura replies against a blank white background. In the manga, some scenes give the appearance that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura's brother Toya; however, according to Volume 1 of ''Clamp No Kiseki: The Ultimate Collection'', and an interview in the ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', this was an error caused by one of the finishing artists not being aware that CLAMP intended for Tomoyo to have romantic feelings for Sakura.<ref name=\"hawt\">interview printed in ''Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book'', published by Nakayoshi.</ref> Instead, she encourages Sakura's love of Yukito, and later becomes Syaoran's confidante and [[Wingman (social)|wingman]] when he begins to fall in love with Sakura.\n\nCLAMP stated that the reason that Sakura does not return her friend Tomoyo's feelings is not because Tomoyo is another girl, as Sakura does not consider sex or gender as barrier for her romantic attraction. She simply doesn't have romantic feelings for Tomoyo in particular.<ref name=\"CCS-Memorial\">{{cite book|title=Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book|publisher=[[Kodansha]]|date=February 2001|isbn=978-4-06-324535-6|language=Japanese}}</ref> Demonstrating this, Sakura confesses that she has a crush on a female teacher in the series.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nAlthough not the actual character, two of Tomoyo's alternate forms make an appearance in ''Cardcaptor Sakura''{{'}}s spiritual successor ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', three in the animated version.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, the character is voiced by [[Junko Iwao]].

But her intense devotion to Sakura -- sewing elaborate costumes for each Clow Card chase, documenting Sakura's successes on video, assuring Sakura that she \"really likes\" her -- verges on the creepy.

His birthday is February 29. Though he teases her frequently, he cares a great deal for her and works to protect her. He is fully aware of what she is doing as a Cardcaptor, and regularly takes on several part-time jobs that put him in a position to be nearby when she is working on capturing a card. He disliked Syaoran and often holds a grudge against him but deep down he thought to himself that if there was someone Sakura should be with it would be Syaoran. Touya possesses several magical powers, including the ability to see ghosts and other non-humans, the ability to sense when Sakura is in danger, and mild [[precognition]]. He has an extremely close relationship with his best friend [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito]], despite knowing he is the alter-ego of Yue. To save both Yukito and Yue, Touya becomes a normal human being after he gives all of his magical powers to Yue, making him promise to protect Sakura in his stead as well as himself (and, by extension, Yukito).<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 65 ''Sakura, Yukito, and the Vanishing Power''</ref> However, it has been revealed in the last chapter of ''Clear Card'' arc that he is gradually regaining his magic and seems to be developing new and greater abilities that he shall reveal until the time is right. \n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Touya is voiced by [[Tomokazu Seki]]. In the English manga his name is spelled \"Toya\". In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', his name is changed to '''Tori Avalon''', and he is voiced by [[Tony Sampson]]. In the English dub of the second film, [[Kirk Thornton]] takes over the voicing role. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Touya is voiced by [[Clifford Chapin]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yukito Tsukishiro / Yue {{anchor|Yukito Tsukishiro|Yue}} ===\nYue/Yukito are a [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]: Yukito is a \"false\" persona created to mask Yue's \"true\" identity. For most of the series, Yue remained in a \"[[Hibernation|state of hibernation]]\"; Yukito is unaware of Yue's existence, though he maintains an enormous appetite for food in an unconscious attempt to give Yue power. Yue's existence is revealed to the other characters after all of the Clow Cards are collected, and Toya states he knew of Yue's existence all along and was just waiting for Yukito to notice himself.\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yukito Tsukishiro'''|\u6708\u57ce \u96ea\u514e|Tsukishiro Yukito|nicknamed 'Yuki' by Toya, and 'Yuki-usagi' by Kerberus}} is the best friend of Sakura's older brother, Touya, and the human alter-ego of the Clow Card guardian, [[#Yue|Yue]]. Though he is certainly Yue's \"temporary form\", he is referenced several times by other characters (including Eriol and Yue himself) as being simultaneously a completely separate \"heart\" from Yue's \"true form\". As Yukito, he displays a kind and gentle nature, and at the start of the series, Sakura develops a strong [[limerence]] towards him. When she confessed her feelings, he gently rejects her, as the one he loves most is Touya.\n\n:Once Sakura collects all of the cards, Yue begins needing greater power as her magic isn't strong enough to sustain him. Subconsciously, Yukito begins eating even more to try to compensate, but it is not enough and he starts sleeping constantly, even while standing, and eventually finds his body fading away altogether. Once Touya gives his magical energy to Yue to sustain them, Yukito begins to grow aware of Yue's existence; the grandparents with whom Yukito thought he lived were a false memory and thus did not exist. It is suggested that he came into existence shortly before he met Touya, to be near the future new guardian of the Clow Cards. Eriol tells Yue that while he (and Clow) did know Sakura was predestined to be the future master of the cards, and had predicted that both Sakura and Yue would be [[Romance (love)|romantically involved]] with each other; however, Yukito had deviated from this prophetic vision by [[falling in love]] with Touya.\n\n:In the Japanese anime adaptation Yukito is voiced by [[Megumi Ogata]]. In ''Cardcaptors'', Yukito's name is changed to '''Julian Star''', his love for Touya is removed, and he is voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Steve Staley]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Yukito is voiced by [[Justin Briner]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n:{{nihongo|'''Yue'''|\u6708|extra=[[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Pinyin]]: ''Yu\u00e8''}} is the one of two Guardians of the Clow Cards, along with Cerberus. His name, which is written in ''[[kanji]]'' rather than ''[[hiragana]]'' is the [[Mandarin Chinese]] word for \"moon\". Whereas Cerberus is the elector of the new Clow Card Master, Yue is the judge who is allowed to test the candidate for their worthiness. He spends most of the series in his temporary form, [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]], who initially has no memory or knowledge of his other self. Unlike Cerberus, Yue's powers are heavily dependent on the power of his master. Sakura's power is not yet strong enough to sustain him after he awakens, particularly after she begins transforming the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards. Yue's growing need for power is reflected in Yukito's ravenous appetite and later constant sleeping. Similarly, the deficit affects Yue himself in instances such as the blatant failure of his magic which causes he and Sakura to fall out of the sky during one of Eriol's synthesized 'situations'. Eventually, Sakura's brother Toya reveals that he knows Yue and Yukito are not human and gives his power to Yue to sustain his existence so he does not lose Yukito.\n\n:As with [[Ruby Moon]], Yue's \"true form\" has no biological sex or gender; though not \"human or male\", Yue has the appearance of a [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] beautiful \"angelic-[[bish\u014dnen]]\" young man (male pronouns used) with long, silver, braided hair, silver-purple feline eyes, and a pair of white angel wings which he uses for flight. Yue sports a white suit and spats-like coverings on his feet. His personality is depicted as serious and aloof in contrast to Yukito's, and while Yukito is fond of Sakura, Yue is reluctant to accept her. As the series progress, he comes to respond to Sakura's request that rather than being his master, she just wants to be his friend. Yue has jurisdiction over the elements wind and water, though he is stated by Cerberus to have control over other cards, including the Wood, Time and Dark.\n\n:{{anime voices2|Yue|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Samuel Vincent]]|type=tv}} In the English dub of the second anime film, his voice is provided by [[Steve Staley]].

As such, he initially rivals against Sakura because he believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards and tries to capture the cards for himself. As the series progresses, however, Syaoran comes to respect Sakura and becomes her friend and ally. He eventually falls in love with her, though she is slow to realize it due to her own feelings for Yukito.\n\nOriginally, Syaoran appeared [[Infatuation|smitten]] with Yukito, but later revealed that the attraction was due to high moon power inside of Yukito. Eventually, in the beginning of the third season, Syaoran finally begins to realize he has deeply fallen in love with Sakura, as he constantly blushes whenever he is around her.<ref>''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 47 ''Sakura and the Mysterious Transfer Student''</ref> In the manga, Syaoran begins to develop feelings for Sakura around the time of the Erase Card's capture. Once Syaoran realizes his feelings, he tries to admit his love for Sakura several times, but is both too nervous to confess his feelings while also being constantly interrupted. Syaoran also becomes extremely jealous whenever he sees Sakura spending time with Eriol, believing he harbours romantic feelings for Sakura and considers him a rival. Syaoran's love for Sakura is proven to be really strong as he thinks strongly of her well being and needs before his own as shown when after Yukito rejects Sakura's feelings, Syaoran comforts her even though Sakura is still unaware about his own romantic feelings towards her. Nearing the end of the series, Syaoran finally confesses his feelings to Sakura, but decides to return to [[Hong Kong]], since Sakura has now become the new master of the cards.\n\nIn the series finale movie, ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card]]'', he and Meiling return from Hong Kong a few months later to visit. Throughout the movie, Syaoran waits for Sakura to reply to his confession, but as Sakura constantly keeps trying to tell him how she feels, they are repeatedly interrupted. Syaoran and Sakura work together to defeat the Nothing Card that has been secretly stealing the Sakura cards while making parts of Tomoeda disappear. Eventually at the end of the movie, they manage to defeat the Nothing Card, which becomes the Hope Card and Sakura finally confesses her love for Syaoran and jumps into his arms.\n\nTwo years later, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda and enrolls at the same middle school as Sakura and most of her friends. However, his true objective is to watch over Sakura and help her with the mystery surrounding the Clear Cards. He also keeps contact with Eriol, who instructs him to not interfere until the time is right. Later he reveals to Sakura that he was the one who took away the spirits contained within the Sakura Cards in order to protect herself from her own power, which is growing out of control, thus leading to the creation of the Clear Cards. Despite intending to reveal all the truth to Sakura, Syaoran becomes unable to tell her anything about Akiho or Kaito's involvement due to a spell Kaito placed on him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Syaoran manages to catch several cards by playing a major role in helping Sakura seal them. He is allowed to attempt the final judgment but fails. Syaoran is shown to have similar powers to Sakura, such as sensing Clow Cards and magical auras, is a skilled martial artist, and wields a sword which he can use to cast spells when equipped with incantation papers. He can also use a device (dubbed a \"[[wiktionary:\u7f85\u91dd\u76e4|lasenboard]]\" in ''Cardcaptors''<ref>''Cardcaptors'', Episode 8 ''Sakura's Rival''</ref>), which can detect and direct him to magical entities. A running gag is Kero calling him \"kid\".\n\nIn Japanese media, Syaoran is voiced by [[Motoko Kumai]]. In the second movie, he is voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Jason Liebrecht]], who reprised his role as Syaoran from ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Nelvana's English dub ''Cardcaptors'', his full name is switched around as '''Li Showron''', and is voiced by [[Rhys Huber]] during the Clow Cards arc and the first movie, and Jordan Kilik in the Sakura Cards arc. He is introduced as the male lead in the first episode of the dub (episode 8 of the original anime), is also called a \"Cardcaptor\", his feelings for Yukito were replaced with shyness, and is more abrasive and blunt than in the original anime. In the dub as well for Sakura, Syaoran never told his feelings towards Sakura as he did in episode 69, one episode before the finale.\n\n===Meiling Li===\n'''Meiling Li''' (\u674e\u8393\u9234 ''L\u01d0 M\u00e9il\u00edng'', \u30ea\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3 ''Ri Meirin'', Cantonese Jyutping: ''lei5 mui4 ling4''), is [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]'s cousin and fianc\u00e9e, and only appears in the anime adaptation of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. Introduced towards the end of episode 19, she is a very impulsive, bratty, straightforward, clingy, and overconfident girl. As children living in Hong Kong, Meiling and Syaoran trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from its cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked Syaoran above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged, much to Syaoran's chagrin. At the same time, she promised that if he found someone he liked more than her, he would tell her and she would release him from the promise.<ref>Ep 43<!-- proper ref later --></ref>\n\nIn coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran find and gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43 by her mother due to unknown reasons. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she acknowledges and accepts Sakura  as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep her promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and her. She releases Syaoran from their promise, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at [[#Tomoyo Daid\u014dji|Tomoyo Daid\u014dji]]'s house and releases all of her frustration by crying without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, to see her old friends, but secretly came back to help Sakura finally confess her love to Syaoran. Meiling also occasionally appears in the anime adaptation of ''Clear Card'', talking to Sakura on phone and giving her hints at developing her relationship with Syaoran. A running gag is Kero calling her \"brat\".\n\nAlong with her temporary stay in Tomoeda and being supportive of Syaoran, Meiling also plays a limited role in the story because, unlike Syaoran, she has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers and tendency to leap before thinking, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style.<!-- ep 43 -->\n\nIn ''Clear Card'' episode 13, Meiling matured and is much less of a brat than she used to be. Even Sakura is amazed to see Meiling speak so politely to Fujitaka, to which Meiling responds, \u201cIt\u2019s just good manners,\u201d as if that's how she's always been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/04/23/meiling-is-the-most-delightful-surprise-in-cardcaptor-sakura-clear-card|title=Meiling is the Most Delightful Surprise in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMeiling sports an [[Odango (hairstyle)|odango hairstyle]] on every episode that she is in.\n\nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Meiling is voiced by [[Yukana|Yukana Nogami]]. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by [[Julie Maddalena]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Trina Nishimura]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', she is known as '''Meilin Rae''' and is voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]]. Her unrequited engagement with Syaoran was omitted along with the fact that she and Syaoran were cousins. Rather she is portrayed as a long time friend of Syaoran and her romantic feelings toward him were watered down but still evident.\n\n==Recurring characters in the manga==\n===Clow Reed===\n{{nihongo|'''Clow Reed'''|\u30af\u30ed\u30a6\u30fb\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9|Kur\u014d R\u012bdo}} is the sorcerer who originally created the Clow Cards, and their magical guardians [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] and [[#Yue|Yue]]. Along with Kohaku of ''[[Wish (manga)|Wish]],'' and Yuuko of ''[[xxxHolic]],'' he is one of the few Clamp-created characters to appear in more than one work.\n\nBorn of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications. However, few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life, though multiple characters comment on his eccentricity. He displays a gentle and affable personality in his interactions with his creations.\n\nWhen Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then-unborn descendant [[Sakura Kinomoto]] to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. Likewise, he deliberately made the sealing wand pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl.<!-- Ep 46 of anime; vol 6 manga --> He also split his soul into two reincarnations: [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] who had all of his memories and magic, and [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka Kinomoto]], Sakura's father. In the anime adaptation, Clow does not split his soul, instead passing on his memories, soul, and powers to Eriol exclusively. Syaoran Li is also an indirect descendant of Clow's Chinese lineage.\n\nIn the anime adaptation and the film, he is voiced by [[Kazuo Hayashi]]. In the English adaptation, ''Cardcaptors'', he is voiced by [[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]. Clow Reed also appears in two additional CLAMP works, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', where he has another descendant named [[Fei-Wang Reed]] and worked with the Dimensional Witch [[Y\u016bko Ichihara]] in arranging the series of events in the former series.\n\n===Fujitaka Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Fujitaka Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u85e4\u9686|Kinomoto Fujitaka}} is the father of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and her brother Touya Kinomoto. A busy professor of [[archaeology]] at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko]] while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that \"an angel has fallen from the sky.\" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning.\n\nLittle is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul (seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world), he split it into two halves. One of these halves became [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]], holding all of Clow's magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other Clow's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by [[Hideyuki Tanaka]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, his name is changed to '''Aiden Avalon''' and he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Scott Evans. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Fujitaka is voiced by [[Jason Douglas]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Sonomi Daidouji===\n{{nihongo|'''Sonomi Daidouji'''|\u5927\u9053\u5bfa \u5712\u7f8e|Daid\u014dji Sonomi}} is the mother of titular character Sakura's best friend [[#Tomoyo Daidouji|Tomoyo Daidouji]], and the first cousin of Sakura's late mother [[#Nadeshiko Kinomoto|Nadeshiko Kinomoto]]. She is rarely seen in the series, but is said to be a wealthy woman and the President of a large toy corporation. She greatly loved her cousin Nadeshiko, and disapproved of her marriage to Fujitaka, later blaming Fujitaka for Nadeshiko's death at a young age. During the marriage, it is implied that Nadeshiko was at least partially cut off from her family. Sonomi maintains a [[pixie cut]], a hairstyle Nadeshiko loved giving her when they were kids; and has Tomoyo keep her hair long because it reminds her of Nadeshiko.\n\nAfter meeting Sakura for the first time, Sonomi realizes that Nadeshiko had lived a happy life and is able to come to terms with the marriage. At times, she still treats Fujitaka as a \"rival\" competing to love Nadeshiko more, but she also helps him pass on gifts from Sakura to her grandfather and to arrange for Sakura to meet her great-grandfather while on a family vacation. Sonomi shows great affection for Sakura\u2013treating her like her own daughter\u2013and often clears her busy work schedule to join her and Tomoyo whenever Sakura comes over to visit.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, her name is changed to '''Samantha Taylor''' and her declaration of love for Nadeshiko is modified to a purely familiar love rather than a romantic love.\n\nSonomi is voiced by [[Miki It\u014d]] in anime series. She is voiced by [[Venus Terzo]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub and by [[Wendee Lee]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Michelle Rojas]].\n\n===Nadeshiko Kinomoto===\n{{nihongo|'''Nadeshiko Kinomoto'''|\u6728\u4e4b\u672c [[wiktionary:\u64ab\u5b50|\u64ab\u5b50]]|Kinomoto Nadeshiko}} is Sakura and Toya's mother, Fujitaka's late wife, and the first cousin of [[#Sonomi Daidouji|Sonomi Daidouji]]. She worked as a model from her teens up until her death. She was sixteen when she met Fujitaka when he worked as a student teacher at her high school. She met Fujitaka when she climbed a tree to rescue a bird nest and accidentally fell, and landed on him as he saved her from getting hurt. He then remarked, \"l had thought an angel fell from the sky\". With those words, she fell in love with him. Soon after, against the wishes of her family, they got married despite their nine-year age gap (he was 25, she was 16). She died from an unnamed illness when Sakura was three. Because she was 27 when she died and Sakura was three and Toya was eight, it is likely that she gave birth to Toya at 19. Although she has died, she is still very much remembered and loved by her family; Fujitaka keeps her picture in the family room and Sakura never fails to greet her photo every morning. She appears occasionally as a spirit and is seen only by Toya, Eriol, and Sakura (beginning with volume 4 of the Clear Card arc).\n\nNadeshiko is voiced by [[Y\u016bko Minaguchi]] in the anime series.  In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaption, her name is changed to '''Natasha Avalon''' and she is voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Megan Shipman.\n\n===Yoshiyuki Terada===\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshiyuki Terada'''|\u5bfa\u7530 \u826f\u5e78|Terada Yoshiyuki}} is a [[teacher]] at Tomoeda Elementary School. During the series, as the main characters go through fourth grade, and enter the fifth grade, he acts as their home room teacher. He is also shown teaching in other classes, including the [[physical education]] classes, and he acts as the chaperon on several school field trips. As the series progresses, it is revealed that he is having a romantic relationship with his student [[#Rika Sasaki|Rika Sasaki]]. In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Syaoran, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out \"Sensei\" (teacher) when she uses the Illusion card to show Rika her most beloved.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his \"hardest working student.\" In the ''Cardcaptors'' English dub, he is simply called '''Mr. Terada''', and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings.\n\nIn the anime series, he is voiced by [[T\u014dru Furusawa]] for the first season and first movie, and by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] for the second and third seasons and the second film. In the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, he is voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]. He is voiced by [[Steven Blum]] in the English dub of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, he is voiced by [[Zach Bolton]].\n\n===Rika Sasaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Rika Sasaki'''|\u4f50\u3005\u6728 \u5229\u4f73|Sasaki Rika}} is a classmate and friend of titular character [[Sakura Kinomoto]]. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved (or greatest fear in the English dub), allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card.\n\nDuring the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher [[#Yoshiyuki Terada|Yoshiyuki Terada]]. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on \"dates.\" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another (it's implied that he reminds her of her father, who's oft busy on overseas business). Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks induced by the Sword card, she calls the image \"Sensei\" which means \"teacher\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look.\n\nAfter graduating from Elementary School, Rika is the only among Sakura's friends who enrolled in a different Junior High School, and thus is not seen with them in ''Clear Card'', although they usually keep in touch.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, Rika's name is changed to '''Rita''' and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed. Instead of being a good student, she is depicted as having trouble with her school work and her blushing around Terada is explained away as being embarrassed at having to stay after school so often and that she is afraid of him.\n\nIn the original anime series, she is voiced by [[Tomoko Kawakami]]. In the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by [[Saki Fujita]]. In the English dub of the second film, she is voiced by [[Dina Sherman|Stevie Bloch]]. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Alex Moore.\n\n===Takashi Yamazaki===\n{{nihongo|'''Takashi Yamazaki'''|\u5c71\u5d0e \u8cb4\u53f2|Yamazaki Takashi}} is a classmate and friend of Sakura Kinomoto and Syaoran Li. He is infamously known for fabricating highly detailed stories on the supposed history of practically any subject, usually whatever Sakura and her friends happening to be discussing.  Sakura and Syaoran are often gullible enough to believe the stories, which often provide an element of humour in the series.  His stories are primarily interrupted by Chiharu, who physically disciplines him by strangling him until he stops talking and will resort to dragging him away when she proves to be unsuccessful.  His storytelling is later supplemented by Eriol, who helps to reinforce the false validity of his stories and whose presence prevents Chiharu from stopping Yamazaki's lies.  Notably, Yamazaki's eyes are almost never open, causing Meiling to hypothesize that he only opens his eyes when telling the truth, a hypothesis that is later proven false.\n\nWhile generally viewed as lighthearted and energetic, Yamazaki can also be sensitive and serious. In the last volume of the manga, when Sakura was down, he leaves the scene in order for Chiharu to talk to Sakura. Chiharu adds that he understands that Sakura needs her guidance and counseling, which is why he left so they could talk rather than stay to tell stories.\n\nYamazaki is named after film director, [[Takashi Yamazaki (film director)|Takashi Yamazaki]], who is a friend of CLAMP.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  He is known as '''Zachary Marker''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'' and his relationship with Chiharu is written so that they are cousins and her acts of strangling are the result of [[sibling rivalry]].  Yamazaki also makes an appearance in Clamp's manga series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' in Piffle Country as an announcer, where he retains his tendency to fabricate elaborate stories.\n\nIn the Japanese version, he is voiced by [[Issei Miyazaki]]. He is voiced by Philip Pacaud in the English ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Joshua Seth]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Takashi is voiced by Alejandro Saab.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Chiharu Mihara===\n{{nihongo|'''Chiharu Mihara'''|\u4e09\u539f \u5343\u6625|Mihara Chiharu}} is one of Sakura Kinomoto's friends and classmates in school.  Along with Rika Sasaki and Naoko Yanagisawa, Chiharu often appears alongside Sakura at school and during school events. She is also on the school's cheerleading squad with Sakura.  Chiharu's most notable trait is her relationship with Takashi Yamazaki, whom she has known since kindergarten.<ref>\"Sakura's Scary Test of Courage\" (Episode 17). ''Cardcaptor Sakura''. 1998. CLAMP, NHK.</ref>  She is never fooled by his rampant storytelling and is usually driven silence him by comically strangling him, which usually does not prevent him from continuing. Despite the rough-handling, she and Yamazaki actually share a close relationship and it is implied that they care for one another in a more affectionate manner. In the last volume of the series, Chiharu speaks openly about her relationship with Yamazaki when Sakura turns to her for advice on love and true feelings as Sakura reflects on her own relationship with Syaoran.\n\nIn the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, she is known as '''Chelsea''' and Yamazaki is written as her cousin to justify the random acts of strangling as sibling rivalry.\n\nIn the Japanese version, she is voiced by [[Miwa Matsumoto]]. She is voiced by [[Jocelyne Loewen]] in the ''Cardcaptors'' dub, and by [[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, she is voiced by Jill Harris.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Naoko Yanagisawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Naoko Yanagisawa'''|\u67f3\u6ca2 \u5948\u7dd2\u5b50|Yanagisawa Naoko}} is one of Sakura Kinomoto's classmates and friends in school and often appears at school events with Sakura's other friends, Chiharu and Rika.  Despite being bad at gymnastics, she is also a member of the school's cheerleading squad alongside Sakura.\n\nNaoko loves reading various types of stories, especially fantasy stories and ghost stories. While Sakura reacts to scary situations with utmost fear, Naoko reacts with fascination and a brave willingness to explore these mysterious situations further.  In the anime, Naoko's love of stories causes trouble when she finds ''The Create'' card in the form of a notebook and writes a fantastic story within it, forcing Sakura to defeat Naoko's creations before recovering ''The Create''.  When Naoko wakes up the next morning to find her book suddenly missing, she believes she just had a supernatural experience.\n\nShe is known as '''Nikki''' in the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors''. She is voiced by [[Emi Motoi]] in the Japanese anime, [[Kelly Sheridan]] in ''Cardcaptors'', and by [[Sherry Lynn]] in the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Naoko is voiced by Dani Chambers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Masaki Amamiya===\n{{nihongo|'''Masaki Amamiya'''|\u96e8\u5bae \u771f\u5b09|Amamiya Masaki}} is the great-grandfather of Sakura Kinomoto, Toya Kinomoto and Tomoyo Daidouji on her mother's side. Initially objecting to Nadeshiko's marriage to Fujitaka Kinomoto, he became more accepting upon meeting Sakura and later receiving a gift from her as a form of peace between family members. In the episode, ''Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories'', Sakura doesn't know who he was and they spent a good time together, playing tennis, having tea, Sakura giving him cookies and Masaki giving Sakura the dress her mother wore. Just before leaving, Sakura used the Rain card to make a rainbow for Masaki, prompting him to remember when Nadeshiko had first pointed out a rainbow to him. Sakura discovers the present Masaki left her was the dress she wore at his summer house, although she does not seem to realizes who he actually is despite Cerberus pointing out its origins.\n\nMasaki later appears in ''Clear Card'', inviting Sakura and Syaoran for another visit to his summer house. In the occasion, he presents Sakura with a mysterious key that once belonged to her mother, and later states that he intends is to have Sakura inherit the summer house itself after he passes away.\n\nIn the anime series, Masaki is voiced by [[Osamu Saka]]. In the English dub, '''Mr. Avalon''' was portrayed instead as the father of Natasha Avalon, making him the grandfather of Sakura instead of her great-grandfather. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Masaki is voiced by Charlie Campbell.\n\n===Kaho Mizuki===\n{{nihongo|'''Kaho Mizuki'''|\u89b3\u6708 \u6b4c\u5e06|Mizuki Kaho}} is a [[miko|shrine maiden]] and the daughter of the priest at the Tsukimine Shrine. She first appears in the series as a new substitute teacher at Tomoeda Elementary School for the math class of [[Sakura Kinomoto]] and [[#Syaoran Li|Syaoran Li]]. While Sakura instantly [[Puppy love|crushes]] on the female teacher and feels a connection with her, Syaoran is distrustful and believes she is up to no good.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Cardcaptor Sakura'', Episode 27 ''Sakura and the Shrine of Memories''</ref>\n\nWhen Sakura, Syaoran, Meiling and Tomoyo are trapped by the Maze card, Kaho uses a mysterious bell to break through Maze's walls allowing Sakura to capture it. After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura's older brother Toya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true.\n\nAfter meeting her, [[#Cerberus|Cerberus]] incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian [[#Yue|Yue]], which is later shown to actually be [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]]. Kaho's role is to use the bell left at her family's shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura's staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England. During the third season of the series, she is primarily \"seen\" through providing a steady, but oftentimes enigmatic exchange of letters with Sakura over the mysterious attacks. After [[#Eriol Hiiragizawa|Eriol Hiiragizawa]] reveals the truth behind the attacks, they learn that Kaho had met Eriol three years before Sakura discovered the Book of the Clow. As they leave for England, Kaho and Eriol confirm their feelings for one another and vow to remain together. She is later seen beside Eriol on a few occasions in both the second movie and the ''Clear Card'' arc.\n\nIn the anime series, Kaho is voiced by [[Emi Shinohara]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', her name is changed to '''Layla MacKenzie''' and she is voiced by [[Linda Rae Jurgens]]. She is voiced by [[Philece Sampler]] in the English adaptation of the second movie. In the English dub of the ''Clear Card'' arc, Kaho is voiced by [[Morgan Garrett]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Eriol Hiragizawa===\n{{nihongo|'''Eriol Hiragizawa'''|\u67ca\u6ca2 \u30a8\u30ea\u30aa\u30eb|H\u012bragizawa Erioru}} is the principal antagonist in the second half of the series, commonly called the ''Master of the Clow'' arc. The reincarnation of [[Clow Reed]], Eriol has both Clow's memories and all of his magic power. He has a magical staff similar to Clow Reed's, can restrain Clow's creations Yue and Cerberus, and has created his own similar pair of guardians: [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]] and [[#Spinel Sun|Spinel Sun]]. He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after [[Sakura Kinomoto]] passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate [[#Takashi Yamazaki|Takashi Yamazaki]] in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him, mainly due to that Eriol is overly nice to Sakura which makes Syaoran jealous. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories of encountering him after he is accidentally seen by him.\n\nEriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to \"feed\" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying.\n\nSakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are forcing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her. He puts the city to sleep and challenges Sakura to convert the last two cards, the Dark and the Light, which must be changed together. After Sakura successfully does so, he then tells her that she is now more powerful than Clow Reed and asks her to perform one final task for him: to divide his own magical power between himself and her father [[#Fujitaka Kinomoto|Fujitaka]]\u2014the other reincarnation of Clow Reed\u2014so that Eriol will no longer be the most powerful magician in the world. He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have been dangerous for Sakura.\n\nEriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with [[#Kaho Mizuki|Kaho Mizuki]], whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc. At the end of the manga series, she returns with him to England, and in the second anime movie, they are shown together when Sakura calls for advice, though their love is never confessed like in the manga, only hinted at indirectly. In the ''Clear Card'' arc. Eriol ceases all contact with Sakura after the Sakura cards turn blank, but keeps in touch with Syaoran who informs him about everything that happens around her. While questioned about his reasons, Eriol claims that he is waiting for the right time to interfere, and thus forbids both Syaoran and his companions in England from taking action until then.\n\nIn the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than him giving an invitation.\n\nThe character of Eriol is voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]]. In the ''Cardcaptors'' English adaptation, his name is changed to '''Eli Moon''' and he is voiced by [[Bill Switzer]].

The counterpart to Clow Reed's original guardian Kerberus. Spinel Sun's true form is a [[butterfly]]-winged [[black panther]] with cat-like ears and ruffs of fur on the side of his head, while his false form is similar to a small [[winged cat]] with the same wing type as his true form. Nicknamed Suppi by [[#Ruby Moon|Ruby Moon]], Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form (though this encounter is exclusive to the anime). Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares Spinel Sun a monster and feeds him sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn him into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle where the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enables him to defeat him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, he is voiced by [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] in his true form, and by [[Yumi T\u014dma]] in his false form. In the second ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' movie, his false form briefly appears and is voiced by [[Philece Sampler]]. In the English adaptation ''Cardcaptors'', his name is changed to '''Spinner Sun''' and both forms are voiced by Colin Murdock. In the ''Clear Card'' arc, Spinel's false form is voiced by [[Apphia Yu]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Ruby Moon===\n{{nihongo|'''Ruby Moon'''|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30fb\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3|Rub\u012b M\u016bn}} is one of two magical guardians created by [[Eriol Hiiragizawa]]. The counterpart to the original guardian Yue. When Eriol transfers to Tomoeda Elementary, Ruby Moon created a false form named {{nihongo|'''Nakuru Akizuki'''|\u79cb\u6708 \u5948\u4e45\u7559|''Akizuki Nakuru''}} and enrolls in Seijou High School, entering the same class as [[#Toya Kinomoto|Toya Kinomoto]], Sakura's brother, and [[#Yukito Tsukishiro|Yukito Tsukishiro]], the false form of Yue who is unaware of his true nature. Her true form resembles a human-sized [[fairy]] that performs ruby-based attacks. Ruby Moon is [[Epicene|sexless]] / [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] and has no biological sex, but prefers feminine pronouns; her \"human sex\" is unspecified, though Akizuki has stated a preference for women's clothing and enjoys \"[[Kawaii|being cute]]\".\n\nUnlike the Yue/Yukito relationship, both Ruby/Nakuru forms are fully aware and display no [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociative personality]]. As the alias, Nakuru Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Toya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter's dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Toya's energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn't simply steal it. When Toya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue's life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to Yue's greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Ruby Moon is voiced by [[Ry\u014dka Yuzuki]]. In the English adaptation, ''Cardcaptors'', both her true form and false form is called '''Ruby Moon''' and she is voiced by [[Willow Johnson]].

She is a young girl who bears a strong resemblance to Sakura, being around the same age and height. Akiho is rarely seen without her stuffed rabbit Momo, which she has owned since she was a small child.\n\nAkiho makes her first appearance in chapter 7 of the ''Clear Card'' arc as a transfer student in Sakura and Tomoyo's class. Akiho used to live in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[England]], and [[Hong Kong]] before moving to Japan, and is initially shy around her classmates due to her nervousness about speaking Japanese. Akiho is gifted at singing and, with Tomoyo and Sakura's encouragement, joins the school choir club.\n\nAkiho lives with her caretaker Yuna D. Kaito in Eriol's old house. She tells Sakura that Yuna has cared for her since she was very young, and suggests that she is distant from her blood relatives. Many of Akiho's relatives are avid [[Bibliophilia|book collectors]] who travel the world in search of rare books. Akiho's family installed its massive library of books in her house, among them one of her most prized possessions, a novel titled \"Alice in Clockland\" written in a foreign script only she can read. Akiho states that she has moved from country to country for most of her life in search of a particular book. When it became apparent that for some unknown reason Akiho and Sakura have shared dreams, it was revealed that Akiho not only possesses strong magic abilities, she is also the figure in the robe that continuously confronted Sakura in her dreams, although Akiho herself doesn't know that, however as Sakura and Akiho continue to enter the same dream, Akiho develops a knowledge of why she is present in those dreams: the mysterious person she is watching has something she wants.\n\nLater is revealed that Akiho is part of the \"D\" magician clan, but despite having born from the two most powerful magicians of the clan at the time, she has no magic power at all, thus the clan decides to use her to create the ultimate magic tool by implanting all kinds of spells inside her body, despite knowing that it would destroy her soul, until Kaito takes her with him.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Akiho Shinomoto is voiced by [[Minori Suzuki]] in Japanese and [[AmaLee|Amanda Lee]] in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Yuna D.

He has served as Akiho Shinomoto's legal guardian and caretaker since she was young. Yuna is a tall, dark-haired young man who appears dressed in full formal uniform, including an unusual pocket watch which he holds dear. He is professional and polite in his interactions with others, and is skilled at various domestic tasks including baking and sewing.\n\nSyaoran senses that Yuna possesses strong [[moon magic]], and Eriol confirms that the \"D.\" in Yuna's name is a title from a notorious English wizarding society. Yuna appears to be aware of both the existence of the Clear Cards and the fact that Sakura is a magician.  Thus-far, it has been hinted that he's after the Clear Cards as a means of powering a certain spell, possibly connected to a magical object, a magical time-controlling pocket watch (mentioned above), which he had stolen from the society of sorcerers he was formally-apart of, and that he's using both Sakura and Akiho to get them (having some-how created a connection between then before they had even met, which is evident by them sharing the same reoccurring dreams but are completely oblivious that they have been seeing one another), but that the ones that Sakura has created so far are not yet enough for his purpose to activate that certain spell of the ancient, forbidden relic that he had taken from the magic association from which he was excommunicated. As such, he turns back time but is certain that Sakura may gradually recall what had occurred between her and the cloaked figure, finally uncovering its identity as her good friend Akiho.\n\nIn the incomplete anime adaptation, Yuna D. Kaito is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] and Brandon McInnis in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Momo===\n{{nihongo|'''Momo'''|\u30e2\u30e2|}} first appears in ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card]]''. Momo appears to be a stuffed toy animal in the form of a white rabbit with light blue scarf around her neck and ears which Akiho Shinomoto usually carries around on her bag as a plushie of sorts. However she was eventually revealed to be actually a magical creature much like Kero and Spinel, but while Akiho is unaware of this, Yuna is the only one who has been seen to communicate with Momo as of yet. Both of them are of the consensus that they need to watch over Akiho.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Momo is voiced by [[Minako Kotobuki]] and [[Jad Saxton]] in English.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Recurring characters in the anime==\nThese characters only appears in the animated films and television series adaptations.\nThese are character that appears only in the anime adaptation of ''Cardcaptor Sakura''.\n\n===Wang Wei===\n{{nihongo|'''Wang Wei'''|\u5049\u671b|W\u011biw\u00e0ng}} is a character that appears only in the ''Cardcaptor Sakura'' anime adaptation.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Germany", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Eugenio Pacelli]], who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, [[The Holocaust]], and the remainder of the Nazi period.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n===Reichskonkordat===\n{{main article|Reichskonkordat}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|Signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]] \"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\"/> In April, Hitler sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and former member of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], to Rome to offer negotiations about a ''Reichskonkordat''. On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, [[Ludwig Kaas]], the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen. One of Hitler's key conditions for agreeing to the concordat, in violation of earlier promises, had been the dissolution of the Centre Party, which occurred on 5 July.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Toland & Atkin.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}</ref>\n\nShortly before signing the Reichskonkordat on 20 July, Germany signed similar agreements with the major [[Protestant]] churches in Germany.

The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'.

''Mit Brennender Sorge'' ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also.

He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]].

If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]] \"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\"/> In April, Hitler sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and former member of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], to Rome to offer negotiations about a ''Reichskonkordat''. On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, [[Ludwig Kaas]], the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen.

There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also.

In Rome, Pius XI told a group of Belgian pilgrims on 6 September 1938, that it was not possible for Christians to participate in anti-Semitism:\"<ref>Martin Gilbert; ''Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster''; HarperPress; 2006; p.137</ref> \"Mark well that in the Catholic [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], [[Abraham]] is our Patriarch and forefather.

[[Robert Ley]], the Nazi Minister of Labour declared the following day in Vienna: \"No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. We deny the Pope's statement that there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites.\" Catholic leaders including Cardinal Schuster of Milan, Cardinal van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Verdier in Paris backed the Pope's strong condemnation of Kristallnacht.<ref>Martin Gilbert; ''Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster''; HarperPress; 2006; p.172</ref>\n\nPius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its \"ideology of race\".<ref name=\"spectator.org\">[http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print ''Hitler's Pope?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027155520/http://www.spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |date=27 October 2008 }}; [[Martin Gilbert]]; The American Spectator; 18/8/06</ref> Pacelli succeeded Pius XI on the eve of war in 1939.

Pius XI had managed to orchestrate a swelling chorus of Church protests against the racial legislation and the ties that bound Italy to Germany. He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEncyclicals:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI_and_Germany"}
