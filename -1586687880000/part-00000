On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organisations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.\n\n===Singh's speech===\nFollowing his conviction, he made a speech which the judge directed should not be released to the press.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the [[Indian_Workers%27_Association#Split_in_the_IWA_(GB)|Indian Workers Association (GB)]], ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/> This proved successful in 1996, when his speech was published along with three further files covering the trial, and the ''Ghadar Directory'', a document compiled by British intelligence in 1934 detailing 792 people regarded as a threat including Udham Singh.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/>\n\nHe started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:\n\n:\"I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so called civilisation has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race. All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and blood thirsty way in which the so called intellectuals who call themselves rulers of civilisation in the world are bastard blood . . .\"\n\nAt this point he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion he continued:\n\n:\"I do not care about sentence of death. It means nothing at all. I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I am dying for a purpose.\u2019 Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed, \u2018We are suffering from the British Empire.\u2019 Udham Singh continued more quietly. \u2018I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.\n\n:\"I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court. You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to death.\u2019\n\n:\"I never meant anything; but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism will be smashed.\u2019\n\n:\"Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and Christianity flies.\u2019\n\n:\"Your conduct, your conduct \u2013 I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist Government.\u2019\n\n:\"You people are suffering \u2013 workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery. Killing, mutilating and destroying \u2013 British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.\"\n\nAt this point the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:\n\n:\"You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in India.\n\nHe then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:\n\n:'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!\"\n\nHe turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor\u2019s table.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/>\n\nWhen this material was published, it was reported in both British and Asian press, the statement was translated into [[Gurmukhi]] script and distributed at the Sikh [[Vaisaki]] Festival in Birmingham, April 1997.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/> John Major, the [[prime Minister]] at that time remarked: \"The Amritsar Massacre was an unhappy episode in Indo-British relations which was controversial in both countries.

Initially asked to explain his motivations, Singh stated: I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. I don't belong to society or anything else. I don't care. I don't mind dying. What is the use of waiting until you get old? ... Is Zetland dead? He ought to be. I put two into him? I bought the revolver from a soldier in a public house.

He deserved it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?  <ref>CRIM 1/1177, Public Record Office, London, p. 64</ref>{{verify source|date=May 2014}}</blockquote>\n\nSingh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [[Pentonville Prison]]. His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab. On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organisations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.\n\n===Singh's speech===\nFollowing his conviction, he made a speech which the judge directed should not be released to the press.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the [[Indian_Workers%27_Association#Split_in_the_IWA_(GB)|Indian Workers Association (GB)]], ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/> This proved successful in 1996, when his speech was published along with three further files covering the trial, and the ''Ghadar Directory'', a document compiled by British intelligence in 1934 detailing 792 people regarded as a threat including Udham Singh.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/>\n\nHe started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:\n\n:\"I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so called civilisation has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race. All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and blood thirsty way in which the so called intellectuals who call themselves rulers of civilisation in the world are bastard blood . . .\"\n\nAt this point he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion he continued:\n\n:\"I do not care about sentence of death. It means nothing at all. I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I am dying for a purpose.\u2019 Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed, \u2018We are suffering from the British Empire.\u2019 Udham Singh continued more quietly. \u2018I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.\n\n:\"I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court. You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to death.\u2019\n\n:\"I never meant anything; but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism will be smashed.\u2019\n\n:\"Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and Christianity flies.\u2019\n\n:\"Your conduct, your conduct \u2013 I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist Government.\u2019\n\n:\"You people are suffering \u2013 workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery. Killing, mutilating and destroying \u2013 British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.\"\n\nAt this point the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:\n\n:\"You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in India.\n\nHe then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:\n\n:'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!\"\n\nHe turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor\u2019s table.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/>\n\nWhen this material was published, it was reported in both British and Asian press, the statement was translated into [[Gurmukhi]] script and distributed at the Sikh [[Vaisaki]] Festival in Birmingham, April 1997.<ref name=\"SUSWT\"/> John Major, the [[prime Minister]] at that time remarked: \"The Amritsar Massacre was an unhappy episode in Indo-British relations which was controversial in both countries.

It possesses [[anticholinergic]], [[central nervous system depressant]], and [[local anesthetic]] effects.
