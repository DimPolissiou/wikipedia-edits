Bosc\u00e0 was born in [[Barcelona]] and was one of three children. His father, Joan Valent\u00ed Bosc\u00e0, was a public official, and his mother was named Violant Almog\u00e0ver. Bosc\u00e0's father died in 1492. Around 1507, Bosc\u00e0 left to live in the court of [[Fernando and Isabel]], where he was a student of [[Lucio Marineo Siculo]] from [[Vizzini]], [[Italy]],<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3039259 JSTOR: Renaissance Quarterly, Vol. 50, No. 3 (Autumn, 1997 ), pp. 701-722:# Marineo Siculo: A Protagonist of Humanism in Spain(Erika Rummel)]</ref> who taught him the skill of translating [[Italian language|Italian]] [[love]] [[poetry]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] lyrics into Spanish. Marineo's teachings evidence the close cultural interactions that existed between Spain and Italy and helped to develop the talent of Bosc\u00e1n.\n\nBy 1522, Joan Bosc\u00e0 was working as a tutor to [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo]], [[Duke of Alba]]. In this same year, he participated with [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] in giving naval assistance to the [[Isle of Rhodes]] during a [[Turkey|Turkish invasion]]. Bosc\u00e0 fought against the Turks again in 1532 with \u00c1lvarez de Toledo and [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] in [[Vienna]]. During this period, Bosc\u00e1n had made serious progress in his mastery of verse in the Italian style.\n\nBosc\u00e0 is most famous for the incorporation of hendecasyllable verses into Spanish. Although he was preceded by [[\u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez de Mendoza]] (also known as [[Marqu\u00e9s de Santillana]]), who wrote 42 sonnets in the Italian style, Bosc\u00e0 was one of the first people to use the present-day structures of the sonnet in [[Spanish language|Castilian]]. His originality and open-minded nature made him an innovator, and his use of hendecasyllabic verse gave his poetry a distinctly creative flare that allowed him to emphasize the emotions and significance of each poem.\n\nIn the 1520s he came under the influence of [[Andrea Navagiero]], the [[Venice|Venetian]] ambassador to [[Spain]]. It is because of Navagiero's persuasion that Bosc\u00e0 abandoned the traditional eight-syllable verses of Spanish poetry. Bosc\u00e1n  was also influenced by another Italian ambassador (a friend of Navagiero) named Count [[Baldassare Castiglione]]. Bosc\u00e1n was urged by Castiglione and [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso]] to translate the ambassador's \"[[Il Cortegiano]]\" into Spanish, which was published on 2 April 1534 to great success.\n\nWith Bosc\u00e1n's fame came great controversy, because he constantly had to combat with those who preferred the old style of poetry over the new. In 1539, he married Ana Gir\u00f3n de Rebolledo of Valencia and fathered three daughters. Bosc\u00e1n died on 21 September 1542 after becoming ill in [[Perpignan]], while he was preparing some of his poetry for publication.\n\n==Works==\nJoan Bosc\u00e0's most famous works appear in ''Las obras de Bosc\u00e1n y algunas de Garcilaso de la Vega repartidas en quatro libros'' (''The Works of Bosc\u00e0 and Some of Garcilaso de la Vega Divided in Four Volumes''). In volume three, this includes ''Leandro y Hero'' ([[Hero and Leander|Leander and Hero]]), based on an ancient [[Greek fable]] and ''Ottava Rima'' (Royal Octave).

Madrid: Catedra, 1999.</ref> ''Cap\u00edtulo'', which begins in a rather conventional manner, but then turns to describe in the last thirty-two tercets a painting from antiquity: [[Timanthes]]'s ''The Sacrifice of Iphigenia'' best known for the veil worn by [[Agamemnon ]], her father, since the poet was unable to show his immense suffering.

While the collection was supposed to focus mainly on his poetry, Bosc\u00e0 was soon overshadowed by his friend Garcilaso. In contrast to Garcilaso, who explored several genres and themes in the new Italian style, Bosc\u00e0 wrote mostly about love.

The 2.03&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;foot&nbsp;7&nbsp;inch) by 3.58&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;foot&nbsp;9&nbsp;inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891.  Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] bought the painting for 35,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting.  Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the [[State Russian Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\n==Context==\n''Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of [[Cossack]]s sending a reply to an ultimatum of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mehmed IV]]. The original reply, if it ever existed, has not survived; however, in the 1870s an amateur ethnographer from Yekaterinoslav (today [[Dnipro]]), Ya. Novitsky, found a copy made in the 18th century. He gave it to historian [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]] (1855\u20131940), who by chance read it to his guests, among whom was the painter [[Ilya Repin]]. Repin became curious about the story and in 1880 started the first of his studies.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nAccording to the story, the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (from \"beyond the rapids\", Ukrainian: ''za porohamy''), inhabiting the lands around the lower [[Dnieper River]] in [[Ukraine]], had defeated [[Ottoman Empire]] forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by [[Ivan Sirko]], replied in an uncharacteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities. During Repin's time, the Cossacks enjoyed great popular sympathy. Repin also admired them: \"All that [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]] wrote about them is true! A holy people!

The 2.03&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;foot&nbsp;7&nbsp;inch) by 3.58&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;foot&nbsp;9&nbsp;inch) canvas was started in 1880 and finished in 1891.  Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] bought the painting for 35,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting.  Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the [[State Russian Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\n==Context==\n''Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks'' depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of [[Cossack]]s sending a reply to an ultimatum of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mehmed IV]]. The original reply, if it ever existed, has not survived; however, in the 1870s an amateur ethnographer from Yekaterinoslav (today [[Dnipro]]), Ya. Novitsky, found a copy made in the 18th century. He gave it to historian [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]] (1855\u20131940), who by chance read it to his guests, among whom was the painter [[Ilya Repin]]. Repin became curious about the story and in 1880 started the first of his studies.{{citation needed|date = April 2014}}\n\nAccording to the story, the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (from \"beyond the rapids\", Ukrainian: ''za porohamy''), inhabiting the lands around the lower [[Dnieper River]] in [[Ukraine]], had defeated [[Ottoman Empire]] forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by [[Ivan Sirko]], replied in an uncharacteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities. During Repin's time, the Cossacks enjoyed great popular sympathy. Repin also admired them: \"All that [[Nikolai Gogol|Gogol]] wrote about them is true! A holy people! No one in the world held so deeply freedom, equality, and fraternity.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoukes.com/history/cossack_letter/|title=InfoUkes: Ukrainian History -- The Cossack Letter: \"The Most Defiant Letter!\"|website=www.infoukes.com|access-date=2020-03-16}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Sultan_Mehmed_IV_(2).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mehmed IV]], [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]] 1648\u20131687]]\n{{quote|Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks:\n\nAs the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians \u2013 I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.|Turkish Sultan Mehmed IV}}\n\nThe Cossacks' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes:\n\n{{quote|Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan!\n\nO sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself.

Boeing and Airbus seek to exploit this by subcontracting production of aircraft components or assemblies to manufacturers in countries of strategic importance in order to gain a competitive advantage overall.\n\nFor example, Boeing has maintained longstanding relationships since 1974 with Japanese suppliers including [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] by which these companies have had increasing involvement on successive Boeing jet programs, a process which has helped Boeing achieve almost total dominance of the Japanese market for commercial jets. Outsourcing was extended on the 787 to the extent that Boeing's own involvement was reduced to little more than project management, design, assembly and test operation, outsourcing most of the actual manufacturing all around the world. Boeing has since stated that it \"outsourced too much\" and that future airplane projects will depend far more on its own engineering and production personnel.<ref>{{cite news | title = Albaugh: Boeing's 'first preference' is to build planes in Puget Sound region | publisher = The Seattle Times| date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2011228282_albaugh02.html | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | first=Dominic | last=Gates}}</ref>\n\nPartly because of its origins as a consortium of European companies, Airbus has had fewer opportunities to outsource significant parts of its production beyond its own European plants. However, in 2009 Airbus opened an assembly plant in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] for production of its A320 series airliners.<ref>{{cite news | title = Airbus' China gamble | publisher = [[Flight International]] | date = October 28, 2008 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/10/28/317890/airbus-china-gamble.html | accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nAirbus sought to compete with the well-established Boeing in the 1970s through its introduction of advanced technology. For example, the [[Airbus A300|A300]] made the most extensive use of [[composite material]]s yet seen in an aircraft of that era, and by automating the [[flight engineer|flight engineer's]] functions, was the first [[widebody]] jet to have a two-person flight crew. In the 1980s Airbus was the first to introduce digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls into an airliner (the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]]).\n\nWith Airbus now an established competitor to Boeing, both companies use advanced technology to seek performance advantages in their products. Many of these improvements are about weight reduction and fuel efficiency. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the first large airliner to use 50% composites for its construction.

In general, airlines prefer to have a choice of at least two engines from the major manufacturers [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. However, engine manufacturers prefer to be single source, and often succeed in striking commercial deals with Boeing and Airbus to achieve this.\n\nIn 2008, the competition was developing between two sides as Airbus selected the [[Rolls-Royce Trent XWB]] alone for the [[Airbus A350]], while GE avoided a $1&nbsp;billion development competing with its [[Boeing 777#Second generation models|Boeing 777HGW]] exclusive [[GE90]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Engines the thrust of the Boeing-Airbus battle |publisher= [[The Australian]] |date= April 4, 2008 |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= January 1, 2008 |first= Geoffrey |last= Thomas}}</ref>\nIn 2013, Boeing rejected a Rolls-Royce engine for the [[777X]] to favor General Electric's [[GE9X]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/ge-rolls-out-boeing-seeks-777x-approval |title= GE In, Rolls Out As Boeing Seeks 777X Approval |date=Mar 18, 2013 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\nIn 2014, Rolls-Royce secured its exclusivity to power the [[A330neo]] with the [[Trent 7000]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-rolls-and-airbus-how-the-latecomer-excelled-401791/ |title= Rolls and Airbus \u2013 how the latecomer excelled |work= Flightglobal |date= 21 Jul 2014 |author= Max Kingsley Jones}}</ref>\n\nOther aircraft providing a single engine offering include the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] ([[CFM LEAP]]) or the [[Airbus A220]] ([[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G|P&W GTF]]); while those with multiple sources include the [[Boeing 787]] ([[GEnx]]/[[Trent 1000]]) or the [[Airbus A320neo]] (P&W GTF/CFM LEAP).\n\n===Currency and exchange rates===\nBoeing's production costs are mostly in [[United States dollar]]s, whereas Airbus's production costs are mostly in [[euro]]. When the dollar appreciates against the euro the cost of producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively to the cost of producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only in dollars, while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales in dollars, has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on currency fluctuations between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense\u2014or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704317704574503291415066898|title=Strong Euro Weighs on Airbus, Suppliers|journal= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date= October 30, 2009|page=B3}}</ref>\n\n===Safety and quality===\nBoth aircraft manufacturers have good safety records on recently manufactured aircraft and generally, both firms have a positive reputation of delivering well-engineered and high-quality products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Muellerleile |first1= Christopher M |title= Financialization takes off at Boeing |journal= Journal of Economic Geography |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 663\u2013677 |date= 2009 |doi= 10.1093/jeg/lbp025 |quote= Boeing\u2019s engineers [...] tended to be first and foremost concerned with safety and quality.

After dominating the very large aircraft market for four decades, the Boeing 747 faced a challenge from the A380. In response, Boeing offered the stretched and updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]], with greater capacity, fuel efficiency, and range. Frequent delays to the Airbus A380 program caused several customers to consider cancelling their orders in favour of the refreshed 747\u20138.<ref name=\"times_delays_20061004\">{{cite news | url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9077-2387999,00.html|title=Airbus will lose \u20ac4.8bn because of A380 delays | first=David | last=Robertson | publisher=The Times Business News | date=October 4, 2006 | location=London}}</ref> In February 2019 Airbus announced the end of the A380 production after the remaining orders would be delivered. By June 2019, 154 Boeing 747-8 were ordered and 134 delivered, while 290 Airbus A380 were ordered and 238 delivered.\n\nBoeing pursued and then cancelled several projects, including the [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]]. Boeing's current platform for fleet rejuvenation is the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which uses technology from the Sonic Cruiser concept.\n\nBoeing initially ruled out producing a re-engined version of its 737 to compete with the [[Airbus A320neo family]] launch planned for 2015, believing airlines would be looking towards the [[Boeing Yellowstone Project|Boeing Y1]] and a 30% fuel saving, instead of paying 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there was considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, which uses the 737 for its entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said it was not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus.<ref>{{cite web | last=Associated | first=The | url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9KS9BBO0.htm | title=Southwest waiting to hear Boeing's plan for 737 | publisher=BusinessWeek | date=2011-01-20 | accessdate=2013-02-16}}</ref> Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the [[Boeing 737 MAX|737 MAX]] project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.\n\n==Orders and deliveries==\nIt took Boeing 42 years and 1 month to deliver its 10,000th 7series aircraft (October 1958 \u2013 November 2000), and 42 years and 5 months for Airbus to achieve the same milestone (May 1974 \u2013 October 2016).<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-how-airbus-went-from-zero-to-10000-430347/ |title= How Airbus went from zero to 10,000 |date= 14 October 2016 |work= Flight Global}}</ref> Boeing deliveries considerably exceeded that of Airbus throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s, this lead narrowed significantly but Boeing remained ahead of Airbus. In the 2000s, Airbus assumed the lead in narrow-body aircraft. By 2010, little difference remained between Airbus and Boeing in both the wide-body or narrow-body categories or the range on offer.\n\n<!-- Do not alter figures without updating dates -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;

Boeing and Airbus seek to exploit this by subcontracting production of aircraft components or assemblies to manufacturers in countries of strategic importance in order to gain a competitive advantage overall.\n\nFor example, Boeing has maintained longstanding relationships since 1974 with Japanese suppliers including [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] by which these companies have had increasing involvement on successive Boeing jet programs, a process which has helped Boeing achieve almost total dominance of the Japanese market for commercial jets. Outsourcing was extended on the 787 to the extent that Boeing's own involvement was reduced to little more than project management, design, assembly and test operation, outsourcing most of the actual manufacturing all around the world. Boeing has since stated that it \"outsourced too much\" and that future airplane projects will depend far more on its own engineering and production personnel.<ref>{{cite news | title = Albaugh: Boeing's 'first preference' is to build planes in Puget Sound region | publisher = The Seattle Times| date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2011228282_albaugh02.html | accessdate = 2010-06-16 | first=Dominic | last=Gates}}</ref>\n\nPartly because of its origins as a consortium of European companies, Airbus has had fewer opportunities to outsource significant parts of its production beyond its own European plants. However, in 2009 Airbus opened an assembly plant in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] for production of its A320 series airliners.<ref>{{cite news | title = Airbus' China gamble | publisher = [[Flight International]] | date = October 28, 2008 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2008/10/28/317890/airbus-china-gamble.html | accessdate = 2008-11-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Technology===\nAirbus sought to compete with the well-established Boeing in the 1970s through its introduction of advanced technology. For example, the [[Airbus A300|A300]] made the most extensive use of [[composite material]]s yet seen in an aircraft of that era, and by automating the [[flight engineer|flight engineer's]] functions, was the first [[widebody]] jet to have a two-person flight crew. In the 1980s Airbus was the first to introduce digital [[fly-by-wire]] controls into an airliner (the [[Airbus A320 family|A320]]).\n\nWith Airbus now an established competitor to Boeing, both companies use advanced technology to seek performance advantages in their products. Many of these improvements are about weight reduction and fuel efficiency. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the first large airliner to use 50% composites for its construction. The [[Airbus A350 XWB]] features 53% composites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qatar Airways A350 XWB factsheet|url=http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/presskits/?eID=maglisting_push&tx_maglisting_pi1%5BdocID%5D=42440|website=Airbus.com|accessdate=28 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905115116/http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/presskits/?eID=maglisting_push&tx_maglisting_pi1%5BdocID%5D=42440|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Engine choices===\nThe competitive strength in the market of any airliner is considerably influenced by the choice of engine available. In general, airlines prefer to have a choice of at least two engines from the major manufacturers [[GE Aviation|General Electric]], [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]]. However, engine manufacturers prefer to be single source, and often succeed in striking commercial deals with Boeing and Airbus to achieve this.\n\nIn 2008, the competition was developing between two sides as Airbus selected the [[Rolls-Royce Trent XWB]] alone for the [[Airbus A350]], while GE avoided a $1 billion development competing with its [[Boeing 777#Second generation models|Boeing 777HGW]] exclusive [[GE90]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Engines the thrust of the Boeing-Airbus battle |publisher= [[The Australian]] |date= April 4, 2008 |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080101/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23479281-23349,00.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= January 1, 2008 |first= Geoffrey |last= Thomas}}</ref>\nIn 2013, Boeing rejected a Rolls-Royce engine for the [[777X]] to favor General Electric's [[GE9X]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/ge-rolls-out-boeing-seeks-777x-approval |title= GE In, Rolls Out As Boeing Seeks 777X Approval |date=Mar 18, 2013 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\nIn 2014, Rolls-Royce secured its exclusivity to power the [[A330neo]] with the [[Trent 7000]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-rolls-and-airbus-how-the-latecomer-excelled-401791/ |title= Rolls and Airbus \u2013 how the latecomer excelled |work= Flightglobal |date= 21 Jul 2014 |author= Max Kingsley Jones}}</ref>\n\nOther aircraft providing a single engine offering include the [[Boeing 737 MAX]] ([[CFM LEAP]]) or the [[Airbus A220]] ([[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G|P&W GTF]]); while those with multiple sources include the [[Boeing 787]] ([[GEnx]]/[[Trent 1000]]) or the [[Airbus A320neo]] (P&W GTF/CFM LEAP).\n\n===Currency and exchange rates===\nBoeing's production costs are mostly in [[United States dollar]]s, whereas Airbus's production costs are mostly in [[euro]]. When the dollar appreciates against the euro the cost of producing a Boeing aircraft rises relatively to the cost of producing an Airbus aircraft, and conversely when the dollar falls relative to the euro it is an advantage for Boeing. There are also possible currency risks and benefits involved in the way aircraft are sold. Boeing typically prices its aircraft only in dollars, while Airbus, although pricing most aircraft sales in dollars, has been known to be more flexible and has priced some aircraft sales in Asia and the Middle East in multiple currencies. Depending on currency fluctuations between the acceptance of the order and the delivery of the aircraft this can result in an extra profit or extra expense\u2014or, if Airbus has purchased insurance against such fluctuations, an additional cost regardless.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704317704574503291415066898|title=Strong Euro Weighs on Airbus, Suppliers|journal= [[Wall Street Journal]]|date= October 30, 2009|page=B3}}</ref>\n\n===Safety and quality===\nBoth aircraft manufacturers have good safety records on recently manufactured aircraft and generally, both firms have a positive reputation of delivering well-engineered and high-quality products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Muellerleile |first1= Christopher M |title= Financialization takes off at Boeing |journal= Journal of Economic Geography |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 663\u2013677 |date= 2009 |doi= 10.1093/jeg/lbp025 |quote= Boeing\u2019s engineers [...] tended to be first and foremost concerned with safety and quality.

After dominating the very large aircraft market for four decades, the Boeing 747 faced a challenge from the A380. In response, Boeing offered the stretched and updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]], with greater capacity, fuel efficiency, and range.

Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there was considerable demand.

The agreement allows up to 33 percent of the program cost to be met through government loans which are to be fully repaid within 17 years with interest and royalties. These loans are held at a minimum interest rate equal to the cost of government borrowing plus 0.25%, which would be below market rates available to Airbus without government support.<ref name=\"BBCAirbusBoeingQA\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3722888.stm|accessdate=22 October 2014|title=Q&A: Boeing and Airbus | work=BBC News | date=7 October 2004}}</ref> Airbus claims that since the signing of the EU-U.S. agreement in 1992, it has repaid European governments more than U.S.$6.7 billion and that this is 40% more than it has received.\n\nAirbus argues that [[pork barrel]] military contracts awarded to Boeing (the second largest U.S. defence contractor) are in effect a form of subsidy (see the [[KC-X|KC-X program]]).

On 27 September 2012 the EU requested the WTO to approve EU countermeasures against USA's subsidy of Boeing.

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

It is the easternmost city of the [[Inland Empire|San Bernardino-Riverside metropolitan area]]. Needles is geographically isolated from other cities in the county.

The population was 4,844 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 4,830 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].\n\nNeedles was named after [[The Needles (Arizona)|\"The Needles\"]], a group of [[Rock pinnacle|pinnacles]] in the [[Mohave Mountains]] on the Arizona side of the river to the south of the city. The large [[Mohave people|Mohave]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community shares the nearby [[Fort Mojave Indian Reservation]] and the town.  Needles is a gateway to the [[Mojave National Preserve]].\n\n==History==\nNeedles was founded in May 1883 during the construction of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]],{{r|VDP 2020-01-19}} which originally crossed the [[Colorado River]] at [[Eastbridge, Arizona]] three miles southeast of modern Needles. Its name was taken from the Needles, a group of pointed mountain peaks at the south end of the valley, visible only by boat from the Colorado River. However, the crossing was a poor site for a bridge, lacking firm banks and a solid bottom. A bridge was actually built, but it was of poor quality. Not only was it a \"flimsy looking structure\", but it was also an obstacle to navigation on the river. The flooding of the Colorado River destroyed the bridge three times \u2013 in 1884, 1886 and 1888. The railway finally built [[Red Rock Bridge]], a high [[cantilever bridge]], at a narrower point with solid rock footings ten miles downstream near today's [[Topock, Arizona|Topock]]. The bridge was completed in May 1890, and the old bridge was dismantled.<ref name=Lingenfelter>[http://www.ansac.az.gov/UserFiles/PDF/08182014/X028_FMIBurtellLingenfelterSteamboats/FMI%20Lingenfelter%20Steamboats/Steamboats%20on%20the%20Colorado%20River%201852-1916.pdf Richard E.

Its name was taken from the Needles, a group of pointed mountain peaks at the south end of the valley, visible only by boat from the Colorado River. However, the crossing was a poor site for a bridge, lacking firm banks and a solid bottom. A bridge was actually built, but it was of poor quality. Not only was it a \"flimsy looking structure\", but it was also an obstacle to navigation on the river. The flooding of the Colorado River destroyed the bridge three times \u2013 in 1884, 1886 and 1888. The railway finally built [[Red Rock Bridge]], a high [[cantilever bridge]], at a narrower point with solid rock footings ten miles downstream near today's [[Topock, Arizona|Topock]]. The bridge was completed in May 1890, and the old bridge was dismantled.<ref name=Lingenfelter>[http://www.ansac.az.gov/UserFiles/PDF/08182014/X028_FMIBurtellLingenfelterSteamboats/FMI%20Lingenfelter%20Steamboats/Steamboats%20on%20the%20Colorado%20River%201852-1916.pdf Richard E.

It was first held in the late 18th century in [[Ulster]]. It celebrates the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) and victory of Protestant King [[William III of England|William of Orange]] over [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] King [[James II of England|James II]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1690), which began the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland.  \n\nOn and around the Twelfth, large parades are held by the [[Orange Order]] and [[Ulster loyalist]] marching bands, streets are bedecked with British flags and bunting, and [[Eleventh Night|large towering bonfires]] are lit. Today the Twelfth is mainly celebrated in [[Ulster]] (especially in [[Northern Ireland]], where it is a [[Public holidays in the United Kingdom|public holiday]]), but smaller celebrations are held in other parts of the world where Orange lodges have been set up. The Twelfth involves thousands of participants and spectators.\n\nIn [[Ulster]],<!--Northern Ireland didn't exist until 1922 and Twelfth parades started in the 18th century--> where about half the population is from a Protestant background and half from a Catholic background, the Twelfth has been accompanied by violence since its beginning. Many Catholics and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] see the Orange Order and its marches as [[sectarianism|sectarian]], [[triumphalism|triumphalist]] and [[supremacism|supremacist]]. The Order is also politically a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]/loyalist organisation. Violence related to the Twelfth in [[Northern Ireland]] worsened during the 30-year ethno-political conflict known as [[the Troubles]]. The [[Drumcree conflict]] is the most well-known dispute involving Orange marches. \n\nAttempts have recently been made to downplay the political aspects of the marches and present the Twelfth as a cultural, family-friendly event at which tourists are welcome. The majority of events pass off peacefully, however, like all other world class events, there is a small contingency who occasionally stir up trouble.\n\nWhen 12 July falls on a Sunday, the parades are held on the 13th instead.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|Orange Order}}\n\n[[File:Lambegdrumming.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Lambeg drum]]ming contest, [[County Tyrone]]]]\n[[File:Shankill july.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Shankill Road]] decorated with flags and bunting for The Twelfth]]\n\nOrangemen commemorated several events dating from the 17th century onwards, celebrating the continued dominance of [[Protestantism in Ireland]] after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and triumph in the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] (1689\u201391). Early celebrations were 23 October, the anniversary of the 1641 rebellion (an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by Catholic [[gentry]] who tried to seize control of the English administration in Ireland); and 4 November, the birthday of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Protestant victor of the Williamite war in the 1690s. Both of these anniversaries faded in popularity by the end of the 18th century.\n\nThe Twelfth itself originated as a celebration of the [[Battle of Aughrim]], which took place on 12 July 1691 in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|'Old Style']] (O.S.) [[Julian calendar]] then in use. Aughrim was the decisive battle of the Williamite war, in which the predominantly Irish Catholic [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] army was destroyed and the remainder capitulated at Limerick, whereas the Boyne was less decisive. The Twelfth in the early 18th century was a popular commemoration of Aughrim, featuring bonfires and parades. The Battle of the Boyne (fought on 1 July 1690) was commemorated with smaller parades on 1 July. However, the two events were combined in the late 18th century.<ref name=Lenihan>{{cite book |last=Lenihan |first=Padraig |year=2003 |title=1690 Battle of the Boyne |url= |location= |publisher=Tempus |pages=258\u2013259 |ISBN = 9780752425979 }}</ref> The first reason for this was the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|British switch]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]] in 1752, which repositioned the nominal date of the Battle of the Boyne to 11 July [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) (with the Battle of Aughrim nominally repositioned to 23 July N.S.).{{NoteTag|This repositioning was not typical, with most historic dates retained. For exaample, the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605 continues to be commemorated on 5 November, not 16 November.}} The second reason was the foundation of the Orange Order in 1795. The Order preferred the Boyne, due to William of Orange's presence there. It has also been suggested that in the 1790s (a time of Roman Catholic resurgence) the Boyne, where the Jacobites were routed, was more appealing to the Order than Aughrim, where they had fought hard and died in great numbers.<ref>Padraig Lenihan, 1690 Battle of the Boyne, page 258-260)</ref>\n\nThe Order's first marches took place on 12 July 1796 in [[Portadown]], [[Lurgan]] and [[Waringstown]].<ref>McCormack, W J. ''The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001. Page 317.</ref> The Twelfth parades of the early 19th century often led to public disorder, so much so that the Orange Order and the Twelfth were banned in the 1830s and 40s (see [[#Controversies and violence|below]]).\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Annalong Orange arch, July 2010 (05).JPG|thumb|350px|An \"Orange Arch\" and bunting raised over a road in [[Annalong]] (see here for more pictures)]]\n\n===Lead-up to the Twelfth===\nIn the weeks leading up to the Twelfth, Orange Order and other [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] marching bands hold numerous parades in [[Northern Ireland]]. The most common of these are lodge parades, in which one Orange lodge marches with one band. Others, such as the \"mini-Twelfth\" at the start of July, involve several lodges.\n\nFrom June to August, Protestant, unionist areas of Northern Ireland are bedecked with flags and [[bunting (textile)|bunting]], which are usually flown from [[street light|lamp-posts]] and houses. The most common flags flown are the [[Union Jack]] and [[Ulster Banner]]. [[Curb (road)|Kerbstones]] may be painted red, white and blue and [[Murals in Northern Ireland|murals]] may be made. Steel or wooden arches, bedecked with flags and Orange symbolism, are raised over certain streets.<ref>Jarman, Neil. ''Material Conflicts: Parades and Visual Displays in Northern Ireland''. Berg, 1997. p.209</ref> These 'Orange arches' are inspired by [[triumphal arches]].\n\nAs well as the Union Jack and Ulster Banner, the flags of illegal loyalist paramilitary groups\u2014such as the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA)\u2014are flown in some areas. The raising of these flags near Catholic/Irish nationalist neighbourhoods, or in \"neutral\" areas, often leads to tension and sometimes violence. It is seen as deliberately provocative and intimidating.<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/loyalists-erect-flags-outside-catholic-primary-school-and-church-in-carrick-16175841.html \"Loyalists erect flags outside Catholic primary school and church in Carrick\"].

Most of the parades are in [[Ulster]], almost exclusively being held in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]], although Orange lodges elsewhere often hold parades as well. The parade usually begins at an Orange Hall, proceeds through the town or city and out to a large park or field where the marchers, their friends and family, and the general public gather to eat, drink and listen to speeches by clergymen, politicians and senior members of the Order. In the past the Twelfth has been a major venue for discussion of political issues. A church service will also be held and sometimes band prizes will be awarded.<ref>Bryan, Dominic. ''Orange Parades: The politics of ritual, tradition and control''. Pluto Press, 2000. p.147-148</ref> Within Northern Ireland, each District Lodge usually organises its own parade. In rural districts the parade will rotate around various towns, sometimes favouring those in which there is less likely to be trouble, but in other years choosing those in which it is felt the 'right to march' needs to be defended.\n\n[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (012).JPG|thumb|250px|Orangemen in full regalia on 12 July 2011 in Belfast]]\n\nIn Northern Ireland, there is a long tradition of Protestant and loyalist marching bands, which can be found in most towns. The Orangemen hire these bands to march with them on the Twelfth. An instrument almost unique to these marches is the [[Lambeg drum]]. Popular songs include \"[[The Sash]]\" and \"[[Derry's Walls]]\". Explicitly violent songs such as \"[[Billy Boys]]\" may also be played.\n\nThe vast majority of marchers are men, but there are some all-women bands and a few mixed bands. Some all-male bands have female flag or banner carriers. There are also some Women's Orange Lodges which take part in the parades. Orangewomen have paraded on the Twelfth in some rural areas since at least the mid-20th century, but were banned from the Belfast parades until the 1990s.\n\n[[File:Orangemen7.jpg|thumb|250px|Orangemen returning from the field less formally]]\n\nOrangemen on parade typically wear a dark suit, an Orange [[sash]], white gloves and a [[bowler hat]].<ref name=boy/> Certain Orangemen carry a ceremonial sword. In hot weather, many lodges will parade in short-sleeved shirts. Orangewomen have not developed a standard dress code, but usually dress formally. The supporting bands each have their own uniforms and colours. Both the Orangemen and bands carry [[Banners in Northern Ireland|elaborate banners]] depicting Orange heroes, historic or Biblical scenes, and/or political symbols and slogans. The most popular image is that of King William of Orange crossing the [[River Boyne]] during the famous battle there.<ref>Bryan, p.99</ref>\n\nAt the field, some lodges and bands don humorous outfits or accessories and make the return journey in them, and the mood is generally more mellow, although in times of tension it can also be more aggressive.{{fact|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe Northern Irish and [[County Donegal]] parades are given extensive local TV and press coverage, while the [[BBC Northern Ireland]] programme ''The Twelfth'' is the longest running outside broadcast programme in Northern Ireland.\n\nOne of the largest Orange demonstrations held anywhere each year is the annual parade held at [[Rossnowlagh]], a tiny village near [[Ballyshannon]] in the south of [[County Donegal]] in the west of [[Ulster]]. County Donegal being one of the Ulster counties in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Rossnowlagh demonstration is the only major Orange event in the Republic. A number of much smaller Orange events take place each year in East Donegal as well.\n\n==Controversies and violence==\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], where around half the population is from an [[Irish Catholic]] background, The Twelfth is a tense time.

It was first held in the late 18th century in [[Ulster]]. It celebrates the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688) and victory of Protestant King [[William III of England|William of Orange]] over [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] King [[James II of England|James II]] at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] (1690), which began the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland.  \n\nOn and around the Twelfth, large parades are held by the [[Orange Order]] and [[Ulster loyalist]] marching bands, streets are bedecked with British flags and bunting, and [[Eleventh Night|large towering bonfires]] are lit. Today the Twelfth is mainly celebrated in [[Ulster]] (especially in [[Northern Ireland]], where it is a [[Public holidays in the United Kingdom|public holiday]]), but smaller celebrations are held in other parts of the world where Orange lodges have been set up. The Twelfth involves thousands of participants and spectators.\n\nIn [[Ulster]],<!--Northern Ireland didn't exist until 1922 and Twelfth parades started in the 18th century--> where about half the population is from a Protestant background and half from a Catholic background, the Twelfth has been accompanied by violence since its beginning. Many Catholics and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] see the Orange Order and its marches as [[sectarianism|sectarian]], [[triumphalism|triumphalist]] and [[supremacism|supremacist]]. The Order is also politically a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]/loyalist organisation. Violence related to the Twelfth in [[Northern Ireland]] worsened during the 30-year ethno-political conflict known as [[the Troubles]]. The [[Drumcree conflict]] is the most well-known dispute involving Orange marches. \n\nAttempts have recently been made to downplay the political aspects of the marches and present the Twelfth as a cultural, family-friendly event at which tourists are welcome. The majority of events pass off peacefully, however, like all other world class events, there is a small contingency who occasionally stir up trouble.\n\nWhen 12 July falls on a Sunday, the parades are held on the 13th instead.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|Orange Order}}\n\n[[File:Lambegdrumming.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Lambeg drum]]ming contest, [[County Tyrone]]]]\n[[File:Shankill july.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Shankill Road]] decorated with flags and bunting for The Twelfth]]\n\nOrangemen commemorated several events dating from the 17th century onwards, celebrating the continued dominance of [[Protestantism in Ireland]] after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and triumph in the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] (1689\u201391). Early celebrations were 23 October, the anniversary of the 1641 rebellion (an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by Catholic [[gentry]] who tried to seize control of the English administration in Ireland); and 4 November, the birthday of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Protestant victor of the Williamite war in the 1690s. Both of these anniversaries faded in popularity by the end of the 18th century.\n\nThe Twelfth itself originated as a celebration of the [[Battle of Aughrim]], which took place on 12 July 1691 in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|'Old Style']] (O.S.) [[Julian calendar]] then in use. Aughrim was the decisive battle of the Williamite war, in which the predominantly Irish Catholic [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] army was destroyed and the remainder capitulated at Limerick, whereas the Boyne was less decisive. The Twelfth in the early 18th century was a popular commemoration of Aughrim, featuring bonfires and parades. The Battle of the Boyne (fought on 1 July 1690) was commemorated with smaller parades on 1 July. However, the two events were combined in the late 18th century.<ref name=Lenihan>{{cite book |last=Lenihan |first=Padraig |year=2003 |title=1690 Battle of the Boyne |url= |location= |publisher=Tempus |pages=258\u2013259 |ISBN = 9780752425979 }}</ref> The first reason for this was the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|British switch]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]] in 1752, which repositioned the nominal date of the Battle of the Boyne to 11 July [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) (with the Battle of Aughrim nominally repositioned to 23 July N.S.).{{NoteTag|This repositioning was not typical, with most historic dates retained. For exaample, the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605 continues to be commemorated on 5 November, not 16 November.}} The second reason was the foundation of the Orange Order in 1795. The Order preferred the Boyne, due to William of Orange's presence there. It has also been suggested that in the 1790s (a time of Roman Catholic resurgence) the Boyne, where the Jacobites were routed, was more appealing to the Order than Aughrim, where they had fought hard and died in great numbers.<ref>Padraig Lenihan, 1690 Battle of the Boyne, page 258-260)</ref>\n\nThe Order's first marches took place on 12 July 1796 in [[Portadown]], [[Lurgan]] and [[Waringstown]].<ref>McCormack, W J. ''The Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001. Page 317.</ref> The Twelfth parades of the early 19th century often led to public disorder, so much so that the Orange Order and the Twelfth were banned in the 1830s and 40s (see [[#Controversies and violence|below]]).\n\n==Events==\n[[File:Annalong Orange arch, July 2010 (05).JPG|thumb|350px|An \"Orange Arch\" and bunting raised over a road in [[Annalong]] (see here for more pictures)]]\n\n===Lead-up to the Twelfth===\nIn the weeks leading up to the Twelfth, Orange Order and other [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] marching bands hold numerous parades in [[Northern Ireland]]. The most common of these are lodge parades, in which one Orange lodge marches with one band. Others, such as the \"mini-Twelfth\" at the start of July, involve several lodges.\n\nFrom June to August, Protestant, unionist areas of Northern Ireland are bedecked with flags and [[bunting (textile)|bunting]], which are usually flown from [[street light|lamp-posts]] and houses. The most common flags flown are the [[Union Jack]] and [[Ulster Banner]]. [[Curb (road)|Kerbstones]] may be painted red, white and blue and [[Murals in Northern Ireland|murals]] may be made. Steel or wooden arches, bedecked with flags and Orange symbolism, are raised over certain streets.<ref>Jarman, Neil. ''Material Conflicts: Parades and Visual Displays in Northern Ireland''.

Most of the parades are in [[Ulster]], almost exclusively being held in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[County Donegal]], although Orange lodges elsewhere often hold parades as well. The parade usually begins at an Orange Hall, proceeds through the town or city and out to a large park or field where the marchers, their friends and family, and the general public gather to eat, drink and listen to speeches by clergymen, politicians and senior members of the Order. In the past the Twelfth has been a major venue for discussion of political issues. A church service will also be held and sometimes band prizes will be awarded.<ref>Bryan, Dominic. ''Orange Parades: The politics of ritual, tradition and control''. Pluto Press, 2000. p.147-148</ref> Within Northern Ireland, each District Lodge usually organises its own parade. In rural districts the parade will rotate around various towns, sometimes favouring those in which there is less likely to be trouble, but in other years choosing those in which it is felt the 'right to march' needs to be defended.\n\n[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (012).JPG|thumb|250px|Orangemen in full regalia on 12 July 2011 in Belfast]]\n\nIn Northern Ireland, there is a long tradition of Protestant and loyalist marching bands, which can be found in most towns. The Orangemen hire these bands to march with them on the Twelfth. An instrument almost unique to these marches is the [[Lambeg drum]]. Popular songs include \"[[The Sash]]\" and \"[[Derry's Walls]]\". Explicitly violent songs such as \"[[Billy Boys]]\" may also be played.\n\nThe vast majority of marchers are men, but there are some all-women bands and a few mixed bands. Some all-male bands have female flag or banner carriers. There are also some Women's Orange Lodges which take part in the parades. Orangewomen have paraded on the Twelfth in some rural areas since at least the mid-20th century, but were banned from the Belfast parades until the 1990s.\n\n[[File:Orangemen7.jpg|thumb|250px|Orangemen returning from the field less formally]]\n\nOrangemen on parade typically wear a dark suit, an Orange [[sash]], white gloves and a [[bowler hat]].<ref name=boy/> Certain Orangemen carry a ceremonial sword. In hot weather, many lodges will parade in short-sleeved shirts. Orangewomen have not developed a standard dress code, but usually dress formally. The supporting bands each have their own uniforms and colours. Both the Orangemen and bands carry [[Banners in Northern Ireland|elaborate banners]] depicting Orange heroes, historic or Biblical scenes, and/or political symbols and slogans. The most popular image is that of King William of Orange crossing the [[River Boyne]] during the famous battle there.<ref>Bryan, p.99</ref>\n\nAt the field, some lodges and bands don humorous outfits or accessories and make the return journey in them, and the mood is generally more mellow, although in times of tension it can also be more aggressive.{{fact|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe Northern Irish and [[County Donegal]] parades are given extensive local TV and press coverage, while the [[BBC Northern Ireland]] programme ''The Twelfth'' is the longest running outside broadcast programme in Northern Ireland.\n\nOne of the largest Orange demonstrations held anywhere each year is the annual parade held at [[Rossnowlagh]], a tiny village near [[Ballyshannon]] in the south of [[County Donegal]] in the west of [[Ulster]]. County Donegal being one of the Ulster counties in the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Rossnowlagh demonstration is the only major Orange event in the Republic. A number of much smaller Orange events take place each year in East Donegal as well.\n\n==Controversies and violence==\nIn [[Northern Ireland]], where around half the population is from an [[Irish Catholic]] background, The Twelfth is a tense time. Orange marches through Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist neighbourhoods are usually met with opposition from residents, and this sometimes leads to violence. Many people see these marches as sectarian, triumphalist,<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10592915 |title=Orangemen take part in Twelfth of July parades |date=12 July 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=25 August 2010 |quote=Some marches have been a source of tension between nationalists who see the parades as triumphalist and intimidating, and Orangemen who believe it is their right to walk on public roads.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE54T1LP20090530 |title=Protestant fraternity returns to spiritual home |date=30 May 2009 |agency=[[Reuters]] |access-date=25 August 2010 |quote=The Orange Order's parades, with their distinctive soundtrack of thunderous drums and pipes, are seen by many Catholics in Northern Ireland as a triumphalist display.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/33821 |title = Ormeau Road frustration |date=27 April 2000 |work=[[An Phoblacht]] |access-date=25 August 2010 |quote = The overwhelming majority of nationalists view Orange parades as triumphalist coat trailing exercises.}}</ref><ref name=\"irishcentral\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/Kinder-gentler-or-same-old-Orange-50952382.html?page=1 |title=Kinder, gentler or same old Orange? |date=23 July 2009 |work=Irish Central |access-date=25 August 2010 |quote=The annual Orange marches have passed relatively peacefully in Northern Ireland this year, and it seems a good faith effort is underway to try and reorient the day from one of triumphalism to one of community outreach and a potential tourist attraction ...
