Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.\n\nThe ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir's case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.<ref>{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role. <ref name=\"Amnesty International\"/>\n\nThe Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, \u201cSome persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.\u201d This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.<ref>{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.\n\nThe policy requires a \"social compensation fee\" for those who have more than the legal number of children.

According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:\n{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:\n\nThe report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health \"Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985\" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.\n\nHans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.\n\nFollowing agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 \"Directive For Surgical Sterilization\" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.\n\nA statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.\n\nA study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.\n\nHaving evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the \"[[Informed consent|consent]]\" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.\n\nMore than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of \"[[life unworthy of life]]\" and \"racial purity\" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a \"healthy nation\" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals \u2013 serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}\n\nSwitzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Further|Eugenics in the United States|Sterilization law in the United States}}\n[[File:SOU 1929 14 Bet\u00e4nkande med f\u00f6rslag till steriliseringslag s 57 Laughlin.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A map from a 1929 Swedish royal commission report displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation by then]]\n\nThe United States During the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 205\u201314| doi = 10.1177/096973300000700303 | pmid = 10986944 }}</ref> [[Thomas C.

Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration.

Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B.

It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing.

Briggs<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.<ref name=\"Briggs\" />\n\n=====Effects=====\nWhen the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.<ref

These contraceptive methods include sterilization, Depo-Provera, Norplant, and IUDs.

Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.\n\nThe ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir's case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people.

These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role. <ref name=\"Amnesty International\"/>\n\nThe Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, \u201cSome persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.\u201d This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.<ref>{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.\n\nThe policy requires a \"social compensation fee\" for those who have more than the legal number of children.

Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:\n\nThe report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health \"Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985\" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.\n\nHans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.\n\nFollowing agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 \"Directive For Surgical Sterilization\" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.\n\nA statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.\n\nA study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.\n\nHaving evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the \"[[Informed consent|consent]]\" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.\n\nMore than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of \"[[life unworthy of life]]\" and \"racial purity\" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a \"healthy nation\" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals \u2013 serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}\n\nSwitzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Further|Eugenics in the United States|Sterilization law in the United States}}\n[[File:SOU 1929 14 Bet\u00e4nkande med f\u00f6rslag till steriliseringslag s 57 Laughlin.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A map from a 1929 Swedish royal commission report displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation by then]]\n\nThe United States During the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 205\u201314| doi = 10.1177/096973300000700303 | pmid = 10986944 }}</ref> [[Thomas C.

Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration.

Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties. The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.<ref name=\"Mass\" />\n\n=====1940s\u20131950s=====\n\nUnemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as \u201c[[Operation Bootstrap]].\u201d<ref name=\"Mass\" /> Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.<ref name=\"Mass\" />\n\nThe 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> Princeton's [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> In response, Puerto Rico's governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.<ref name=\"Mass\" />\n\nAlso during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.<ref

performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.<ref name=\"Mass\" /><ref name=\"Nick\" /><ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\"B\" /> Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\"B\" /> Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name= \"B\" /> This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /><ref name=\"B\" /> There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.<ref name=\"B\" />\n\nBy 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.<ref name= \"Lopez\" />\n\n======Controversy and opposing viewpoints======\nThere has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.\n\nSome scholars, such as Bonnie Mass<ref name=\"Mass\" /> and Iris Lopez,<ref name= \"Lopez\" /> have argued that the history and popularity of

governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.<ref name= \"Lopez\" /><ref name=\"B\" /><ref name= \"Elena\" />\n\nOn the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.<ref name=\"Briggs\" /> She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.<ref name=\"Briggs\" />\n\n=====Effects=====\nWhen the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.<ref

had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.<ref name=\"Mass\" /> In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez<ref name= \"Lopez\" /> showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.<ref name=

Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Borella was one of 64 Australians to receive the Victoria Cross for their actions during the First World War, doing so while serving with the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th Battalion]] around [[Villers-Bretonneux]] in July 1918. After the war, Borella returned to Australia, initially farming a property in Victoria before rejoining the Army during the Second World War and serving in a number of garrison units in Australia. He was demobilised in 1945 and worked as a public servant until he retired in 1956. He died in 1968 at the age of 86.\n\n==Early life==\nAlbert Chalmers Borella was born at [[County of Borung|Borung]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. His parents were Louis Borella and Annie Borella n\u00e9e Chalmers. After attending state schools at Borung and Wychitella, Borella became a farmer, working around Borung and [[Echuca]]. He also enlisted as a part-time soldier in the [[Victorian Rangers]], serving for a period of 18 months. He travelled to Melbourne in early 1910 and became a firefighter in the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], remaining in the city until early 1913 when he travelled to the [[Northern Territory]] to take up a [[pastoral lease]], working a property on the [[Daly River]] until early 1915 when his financial situation forced him to leave the land.<ref name=ADB>{{cite book |author=Fielding, Jean P.  |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070355b.htm |title=Borella, Albert Chalmers (1881\u20131968) |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=Volume 7 |publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=1979 |pages=349\u2013350}}</ref><ref name=Belham>{{cite book|last=Belham|first=David|author2=Denham, Peter|title=The Blue Diamonds: The History of 7th Brigade, 1915\u20132008|year=2009|publisher=Department of Defence|location=Puckapunyal, Victoria|pages=42\u201344 |oclc=525034269}}</ref>\n\n==First World War==\nBorella enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) in [[Townsville, Queensland]], on 15 March 1915.<ref name=Belham/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discoveringanzacs.naa.gov.au/browse/person/33233 |title=Albert Chalmers Borella \u2013 Discovering Anzacs |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> He had to go to some effort to do so because at the outbreak of the First World War the military authorities were not accepting volunteers from the Northern Territory.

In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as ''[[Theotokos]]''. \"Madonna\" may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the [[Life of the Virgin]], e.g. the [[Annunciation to Mary]], are not typically called \"Madonna\".\n\nThe earliest depictions of Mary date still to [[Early Christianity]] (2nd to 3rd centuries), found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&pg=PA191&dq=#v=onepage&q=catacomb&f=false Mary in Western Art]'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 11</ref> These are in a narrative context. The classical \"Madonna\" or \"Theotokos\" imagery develops from the 5th century, as [[Marian devotion]] rose to great importance after the [[Council of Ephesus]] formally affirmed her status as \"[[Mother of God]] or ''Theotokos'' (\"God-bearer\") in 431.<ref>Burke, Raymond, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&pg= Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons]'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}} {{page?}}</ref> \nThe ''Theotokos'' iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres. According to a tradition recorded in the 8th century, Marian iconography goes back to a portrait drawn from life by [[Luke the Evangelist]], with a number of icons (such as the ''[[Panagia Portaitissa]]'') claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Rubens]] (and further by certain modernists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Henry Moore]]), while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Further information|Theotokos#Terminology|Titles of Mary|Queen of Heaven}}\n\nLiturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the ''[[Akathist]]'') was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of \u0394\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (''Despoina'') was adopted as Latin ''Domina'' \"Lady\". The medieval Italian ''Ma Donna'' {{IPA-it|ma\u02c8d\u0254nna|pron}} (\"My Lady\") reflects ''Mea Domina'', while ''Nostra Domina'' (\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd) was adopted in French, as ''Nostre Dame'' \"Our Lady\".<ref>Johannes Schneider, ''Virgo Ecclesia Facta'', 2004,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RfvSAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74 p. 74].\nMichael O'Carroll, ''Theotokos: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Blessed Virgin Mary'', 2000, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=xYlKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127 p. 127].</ref>\n\nThese names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}<!--blue in Mary's dress appears to be *much* older than the 13th century. Cite some references please.-->\n\nWhile the Italian term ''Madonna'' paralleled English ''Our Lady'' in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an [[Art history|art historical]] term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In this sense, \"a Madonna\", or \"a Madonna with Child\" is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A \"Madonna\" may alternatively be called \"Virgin\" or \"Our Lady\", but \"Madonna\" is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' may in English be called \"Our Lady of Vladimir\", while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the \"Madonna of Vladimir\".<ref>\"Madonna of Vladimir\" e.g. in Hans Belting, Edmund Jephcott; Edmund Jephcott (trans.) ''Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image Before the Era of Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 289.</ref>\n\n== Modes of representation ==\nThere are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.\n* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal [[mosaic]]s.\n* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the [[Hodegetria]] was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the [[Sistine Madonna]] by [[Raphael]].\n* The \"Madonna enthroned\" is a type of image that dates from the [[Byzantine]] period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the Madonna and Child often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a [[Sacra conversazione]].\n* The [[Madonna of humility]] refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child [[Jesus]] in her lap.<ref>''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} p. 174</ref> This style was a product of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety,<ref>''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} p. 223</ref><ref>''Iconography of Christian Art'' by [[Gertrud Schiller]], 1971 {{ASIN|B0023VMZMA}} p. 112</ref> and perhaps due to [[Simone Martini]]. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany.

Half-length paintings of the ''Madonna and Child'' are also common in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], particularly in [[Venice]].\n* The seated \"Madonna and Child\" is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in [[Florence]] and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the [[Passion of Christ]].\n* The \"Adoring Madonna\" is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint.\n* The [[nursing Madonna]] refers to portrayals of the Madonna breastfeeding the infant Jesus.\n* The iconography of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] is applied to marian portraiture in a variety of ways over time, depending on the interpretation of the relevant Biblical passage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roten |first1=Johann |title=Crescent Moon: Meaning : University of Dayton, Ohio |url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/crescent-moon-meaning.php |website=udayton.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Madonna and Child by an anonymous Italian, first half of 19th century]]\nThe earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacomb of Priscilla]], Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.<ref>Victor Lasareff, \"Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin\" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''20'''.1 (March 1938, pp. 26-65) p 27f.</ref>\n\nThe earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] strain in culture that rejected physical representations as \"[[idolatry|idols]]\", respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as [[icon]]s ([[Greek language|Greek]] \"image\"). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, [[Pope Agapetus I|Pope Agapetus]] was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the ''theotokos'' and to the portrayal of her image in churches.<ref>m.

Osborne, \"Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche\" ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981), pp. 299-310.</ref>\n\nIn the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] sits with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby [[John the Baptist]] looks on.\n\nLate Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. [[Iconography]] varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] the Child (such as the ''[[Madonna Litta]]'') is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.\n\n===Early images===\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned ''Virgin and Child'' with saints and angels, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], perhaps the earliest iconic image of the subject to survive.]]\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] (\"God-bearer\") was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[wikt:exaltation|exaltation]] above other humans, and has the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of [[Pope John VII]], a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.  This type was long confined to Rome.  The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th - 8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; \"isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe\".<ref>Nees, Lawrence. ''Early medieval art'', 143-145, quote 144, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284243-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284243-5}}</ref>\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocypha]]l sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\nThe ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[:File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|Domenico di Bartolo]], 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].<ref Name =Trinchieri>''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&pg=PA15]</ref>\n\n===Byzantine influence on the West===\n[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century ''Madonna with Child'' in the Italo-Byzantine style.]]\n\nVery few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East.  Important to Italian tradition are [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icons]], especially those created in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring [[medieval]] civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties.  Byzantium (324-1453) saw itself as the true [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], if [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in [[Crusades]] at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures.  Later in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Cretan school]] was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western [[iconography]] when required.\n\nWhile theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated.  Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself.  Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and [[Byzantine silk|luxurious textiles]] were distributed throughout the West.  In Byzantium, Mary's usual title was the [[Theotokos]] or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that [[salvation]] was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God's [[incarnation]]. That [[theological]] concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.\n\nHowever, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold.  First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West.  One is a valued possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], that great architectural wonder of the Ancient [[Roman Empire]], that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church's triumph.  Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in [[tempera]] (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels.  In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons.  Second, they share [[iconography]], or subject matter.  Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son.  It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\n===Later medieval period===\nIt was not until the revival of monumental [[panel painting]] in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout [[Tuscany]].  While members of the [[mendicant orders]] of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes.  Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.  Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion.  Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real [[gold leaf]] in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval [[goldsmith]]s used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles.  Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with [[lapis lazuli]], a stone imported from Afghanistan.\n\nThis is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function.  Often referred to as the Rucellia Madonna (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image.  Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town.  Known as the ''Maesta'' (1308\u20131311), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints.  In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London.  This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.\n\nThe privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.\n\nDespite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire.  Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment.  This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil.  She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing.  Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna's complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.\n\nWhile the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings.  She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West.  She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture.  As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto's narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family's palace in Padua.  This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.\n\nItalian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Gerard David - The rest on the flight into Egypt (National Gallery of Art).jpg|''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (David, National Gallery of Art)|Rest on The Flight into Egypt]]'', c. 1510,<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50.html National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]</ref> by [[Gerard David]] depicts a close, intimate moment of tenderness where she only has eyes for the Child.\nFile:Don Lorenzo Monaco 013.jpg|[[Lorenzo Monaco]], [[Florence]], c. 1410\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance===\nWhile the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers.  Most works of art from this era are sacred.  While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.\n\nSome of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]],{{NoteTag|According to [[W.&nbsp;H. Wackenroder]], some writings by [[Bramante]] reveal that Raphael told him that he discovered how to paint his Madonnas in a visionary dream he had after praying to the Virgin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1-link=Mario Salmi |last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6-link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7-link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |year = 1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location = New York, NY |page = 622 }}</ref>}} [[Giorgione]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]]. They developed on the foundations of 15th-century Marian images by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] in particular, among countless others. The subject was equally popular in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and that of the rest of Northern Europe.\n\nThe subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the [[Annunciation]], and later the [[Immaculate Conception]], led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son.  As a commemorative image, the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son [[Christ]].  The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|The ''Madonna [[Woman of the Apocalypse|on a Crescent Moon]] in [[Hortus Conclusus]]'' by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter.\nFile:Leonardo da Vinci - study of a woman's head.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], a study of the Head of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna]], c. 1484 AD.\n</gallery>\n\n===Modern images===\n[[File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|thumb|180px|''Virgin of the Lilies'', [[Bouguereau]], 1899]]\n\nIn some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.\n\nIn Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a ''Hausmadonna''.

In an Eastern Orthodox context, such images are typically known as ''[[Theotokos]]''. \"Madonna\" may be generally used of representations of Mary, with or without the infant Jesus, is the focus and central figure of the image, possibly flanked or surrounded by angels or saints. Other types of Marian imagery have a narrative context, depicting scenes from the [[Life of the Virgin]], e.g. the [[Annunciation to Mary]], are not typically called \"Madonna\".\n\nThe earliest depictions of Mary date still to [[Early Christianity]] (2nd to 3rd centuries), found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]].<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qd7EZAFouDgC&pg=PA191&dq=#v=onepage&q=catacomb&f=false Mary in Western Art]'' by Timothy Verdon, Filippo Rossi 2005 {{ISBN|0-9712981-9-X}} p. 11</ref> These are in a narrative context. The classical \"Madonna\" or \"Theotokos\" imagery develops from the 5th century, as [[Marian devotion]] rose to great importance after the [[Council of Ephesus]] formally affirmed her status as \"[[Mother of God]] or ''Theotokos'' (\"God-bearer\") in 431.<ref>Burke, Raymond, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ez0VRbQi1i4C&pg= Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons]'' 2008 {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}} {{page?}}</ref> \nThe ''Theotokos'' iconography as it developed in the 6th to 8th century rose to great importance in the high medieval period (12th to 14th centuries) both in the Eastern Orthodox and in the Latin spheres. According to a tradition recorded in the 8th century, Marian iconography goes back to a portrait drawn from life by [[Luke the Evangelist]], with a number of icons (such as the ''[[Panagia Portaitissa]]'') claimed to either represent this original icon or to be a direct copy of it. In the Western tradition, depictions of the Madonna were greatly diversified by Renaissance masters such as [[Duccio]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Rubens]] (and further by certain modernists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Henry Moore]]), while Eastern Orthodox iconography adheres more closely to the inherited traditional types.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Further information|Theotokos#Terminology|Titles of Mary|Queen of Heaven}}\n\nLiturgy depicting Mary as powerful intercessor (such as the ''[[Akathist]]'') was brought from Greek into Latin tradition in the 8th century. The Greek title of \u0394\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (''Despoina'') was adopted as Latin ''Domina'' \"Lady\". The medieval Italian ''Ma Donna'' {{IPA-it|ma\u02c8d\u0254nna|pron}} (\"My Lady\") reflects ''Mea Domina'', while ''Nostra Domina'' (\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd) was adopted in French, as ''Nostre Dame'' \"Our Lady\".<ref>Johannes Schneider, ''Virgo Ecclesia Facta'', 2004,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RfvSAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74 p. 74].\nMichael O'Carroll, ''Theotokos: A Theological Encyclopedia of the Blessed Virgin Mary'', 2000, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=xYlKAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA127 p. 127].</ref>\n\nThese names signal both the increased importance of the cult of the virgin and the prominence of art in service to Marian devotion during the late medieval period. During the 13th century, especially,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} with the increasing influence of chivalry and aristocratic culture on poetry, song and the visual arts, the Madonna is represented as the queen of Heaven, often enthroned. Madonna was meant more to remind people of the theological concept which is placing such a high value on purity or virginity. This is also represented by the color of her clothing. The color blue symbolized purity, virginity, and royalty.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}<!--blue in Mary's dress appears to be *much* older than the 13th century. Cite some references please.-->\n\nWhile the Italian term ''Madonna'' paralleled English ''Our Lady'' in late medieval Marian devotion, it was imported as an [[Art history|art historical]] term into English usage in the 1640s, designating specifically the Marian art of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. In this sense, \"a Madonna\", or \"a Madonna with Child\" is used of specific works of art, historically mostly of Italian works. A \"Madonna\" may alternatively be called \"Virgin\" or \"Our Lady\", but \"Madonna\" is not typically applied to eastern works; e.g. the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' may in English be called \"Our Lady of Vladimir\", while it is less usual, but not unheard of, to refer to it as the \"Madonna of Vladimir\".<ref>\"Madonna of Vladimir\" e.g. in Hans Belting, Edmund Jephcott; Edmund Jephcott (trans.) ''Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image Before the Era of Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1996, p. 289.</ref>\n\n== Modes of representation ==\nThere are several distinct types of representation of the Madonna.\n* One type of Madonna shows Mary alone (without the child Jesus), and standing, generally glorified and with a gesture of prayer, benediction or prophesy. This type of image occurs in a number of ancient apsidal [[mosaic]]s.\n* Full-length standing images of the Madonna more frequently include the infant Jesus, who turns towards the viewer or raises his hand in benediction. The most famous Byzantine image, the [[Hodegetria]] was originally of this type, though most copies are at half-length. This type of image occurs frequently in sculpture and may be found in fragile ivory carvings, in limestone on the central door posts of many cathedrals, and in polychrome wooden or plaster casts in almost every Catholic Church. There are a number of famous paintings that depict the Madonna in this manner, notably the [[Sistine Madonna]] by [[Raphael]].\n* The \"Madonna enthroned\" is a type of image that dates from the [[Byzantine]] period and was used widely in Medieval and Renaissance times. These representations of the Madonna and Child often take the form of large altarpieces. They also occur as frescoes and apsidal mosaics. In Medieval examples the Madonna is often accompanied by angels who support the throne, or by rows of saints. In Renaissance painting, particularly High Renaissance painting, the saints may be grouped informally in a type of composition known as a [[Sacra conversazione]].\n* The [[Madonna of humility]] refers to portrayals in which the Madonna is sitting on the ground, or sitting upon a low cushion. She may be holding the Child [[Jesus]] in her lap.<ref>''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174</ref> This style was a product of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety,<ref>''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223</ref><ref>''Iconography of Christian Art'' by [[Gertrud Schiller]], 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112</ref> and perhaps due to [[Simone Martini]]. It spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany. It was the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.<ref name=Meiss>''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pp. 132\u2013133</ref>\n* Half-length Madonnas are the form most frequently taken by painted icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, where the subject matter is highly formulated so that each painting expresses one particular attribute of the \"Mother of God\". Half-length paintings of the ''Madonna and Child'' are also common in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], particularly in [[Venice]].\n* The seated \"Madonna and Child\" is a style of image that became particularly popular during the 15th century in [[Florence]] and was imitated elsewhere. These representations are usually of a small size suitable for a small altar or domestic use. They usually show Mary holding the infant Jesus in an informal and maternal manner. These paintings often include symbolic reference to the [[Passion of Christ]].\n* The \"Adoring Madonna\" is a type popular during the Renaissance. These images, usually small and intended for personal devotion, show Mary kneeling in adoration of the Christ Child. Many such images were produced in glazed terracotta as well as paint.\n* The [[nursing Madonna]] refers to portrayals of the Madonna breastfeeding the infant Jesus.\n* The iconography of the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] is applied to marian portraiture in a variety of ways over time, depending on the interpretation of the relevant Biblical passage.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roten |first1=Johann |title=Crescent Moon: Meaning : University of Dayton, Ohio |url=https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/c/crescent-moon-meaning.php |website=udayton.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Anonymous Madonna with big breasts.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Madonna and Child by an anonymous Italian, first half of 19th century]]\nThe earliest representation of the Madonna and Child may be the wall painting in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacomb of Priscilla]], Rome, in which the seated Madonna suckles the Child, who turns his head to gaze at the spectator.<ref>Victor Lasareff, \"Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin\" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''20'''.1 (March 1938, pp. 26-65) p 27f.</ref>\n\nThe earliest consistent representations of Mother and Child were developed in the Eastern Empire, where despite an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] strain in culture that rejected physical representations as \"[[idolatry|idols]]\", respect for venerated images was expressed in the repetition of a narrow range of highly conventionalized types, the repeated images familiar as [[icon]]s ([[Greek language|Greek]] \"image\"). On a visit to Constantinople in 536, [[Pope Agapetus I|Pope Agapetus]] was accused of being opposed to the veneration of the ''theotokos'' and to the portrayal of her image in churches.<ref>m. Mundell, \"Monophysite church decoration\" ''Iconoclasm'' (Birmingham) 1977, p 72.</ref> Eastern examples show the Madonna enthroned, even wearing the closed Byzantine pearl-encrusted crown with pendants, with the Christ Child on her lap.<ref>As in the fresco fragments of the lower [[Basilica di San Clemente]], Rome: see John L. Osborne, \"Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche\" ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981), pp. 299-310.</ref>\n\nIn the West, hieratic Byzantine models were closely followed in the Early Middle Ages, but with the increased importance of the cult of the Virgin in the 12th and 13th centuries a wide variety of types developed to satisfy a flood of more intensely personal forms of piety. In the usual Gothic and Renaissance formulas the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] sits with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] on her lap, or enfolded in her arms. In earlier representations the Virgin is enthroned, and the Child may be fully aware, raising his hand to offer blessing. In a 15th-century Italian variation, a baby [[John the Baptist]] looks on.\n\nLate Gothic sculptures of the Virgin and Child may show a standing virgin with the child in her arms. [[Iconography]] varies between public images and private images supplied on a smaller scale and meant for personal devotion in the chamber: the Virgin [[Breastfeeding|suckling]] the Child (such as the ''[[Madonna Litta]]'') is an image largely confined to private devotional icons.\n\n===Early images===\n[[File:Mary & Child Icon Sinai 6th century.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the enthroned ''Virgin and Child'' with saints and angels, and the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], perhaps the earliest iconic image of the subject to survive.]]\n\nThere was a great expansion of the [[cult (religion)|cult of Mary]] after the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, when her status as [[Theotokos]] (\"God-bearer\") was confirmed; this had been a subject of some controversy until then, though mainly for reasons to do with [[Christology|arguments over the nature of Christ]].  In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome, dating from 432-40, just after the council, she is not yet shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and she is also not shown in Nativity scenes at this date, though she is included in the [[Adoration of the Magi]].\n\nBy the next century the iconic depiction of the Virgin enthroned carrying the infant Christ was established, as in the example from the only group of icons surviving from this period, at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]]. This type of depiction, with subtly changing differences of emphasis, has remained the mainstay of depictions of Mary to the present day. The image at Mount Sinai succeeds in combining two aspects of Mary described in the [[Magnificat]], her [[humility]] and her [[wikt:exaltation|exaltation]] above other humans, and has the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] above, up to which the archangels look. An early icon of the Virgin as queen is in the church of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] in Rome, datable to 705-707 by the kneeling figure of [[Pope John VII]], a notable promoter of the cult of the Virgin, to whom the infant Christ reaches his hand.  This type was long confined to Rome.  The roughly half-dozen varied icons of the Virgin and Child in Rome from the 6th - 8th century form the majority of the representations surviving from this period; \"isolated images of the Madonna and Child ... are so common ... to the present day in Catholic and Orthodox tradition, that it is difficult to recover a sense of the novelty of such images in the early Middle Ages, at least in western Europe\".<ref>Nees, Lawrence. ''Early medieval art'', 143-145, quote 144, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-284243-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-284243-5}}</ref>\n\nAt this period the [[iconography]] of the Nativity was taking [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Byzantine image|the form, centred on Mary]], that it has retained up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and on which Western depictions remained based until the [[High Middle Ages]].  Other narrative scenes for Byzantine cycles on the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' were being evolved, relying on [[New Testament apocrypha|apocypha]]l sources to fill in her life before the [[Annunciation to Mary]].  By this time the political and economic collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] meant that the Western, Latin, church was unable to compete in the development of such sophisticated [[iconography]], and relied heavily on Byzantine developments.\n\nThe earliest surviving image in a Western [[illuminated manuscript]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] comes from the [[Book of Kells]] of about 800 (there is a similar carved image on the lid of [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] of 698) and, though magnificently decorated in the style of [[Insular art]], the drawing of the figures can only be described as rather crude compared to Byzantine work of the period.  This was in fact an unusual inclusion in a [[Gospel book]], and images of the Virgin were slow to appear in large numbers in manuscript art until the [[book of hours]] was devised in the 13th century.\n\nThe ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[:File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|Domenico di Bartolo]], 1433, is considered one of the most innovative devotional images from the early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].<ref Name =Trinchieri>''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} page 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&pg=PA15]</ref>\n\n===Byzantine influence on the West===\n[[File:Italo-Byzantinischer Maler des 13. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century ''Madonna with Child'' in the Italo-Byzantine style.]]\n\nVery few early images of the Virgin Mary survive, though the depiction of the Madonna has roots in ancient pictorial and sculptural traditions that informed the earliest Christian communities throughout Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East.  Important to Italian tradition are [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[icons]], especially those created in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), the capital of the longest, enduring [[medieval]] civilization whose icons participated in civic life and were celebrated for their miraculous properties.  Byzantium (324-1453) saw itself as the true [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], if [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking, Christian empire with colonies of Italians living among its citizens, participating in [[Crusades]] at the borders of its land, and ultimately, plundering its churches, palaces and monasteries of many of its treasures.  Later in the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Cretan school]] was the main source of icons for the West, and the artists there could adapt their style to Western [[iconography]] when required.\n\nWhile theft is one way that Byzantine images made their way West to Italy, the relationship between Byzantine icons and Italian images of the Madonna is far more rich and complicated.  Byzantine art played a long, critical role in Western Europe, especially when Byzantine territories included parts of Eastern Europe, Greece and much of Italy itself.  Byzantine manuscripts, ivories, gold, silver and [[Byzantine silk|luxurious textiles]] were distributed throughout the West.  In Byzantium, Mary's usual title was the [[Theotokos]] or Mother of God, rather than the Virgin Mary and it was believed that [[salvation]] was delivered to the faithful at the moment of God's [[incarnation]]. That [[theological]] concept takes pictorial form in the image of Mary holding her infant son.\n\nHowever, what is most relevant to the Byzantine heritage of the Madonna is twofold.  First, the earliest surviving independent images of the Virgin Mary are found in Rome, the center of Christianity in the medieval West.  One is a valued possession of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], one of the many Roman churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  Another, a splintered, repainted ghost of its former self, is venerated at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], that great architectural wonder of the Ancient [[Roman Empire]], that was rededicated to Mary as an expression of the Church's triumph.  Both evoke Byzantine tradition in terms of their medium, that is, the technique and materials of the paintings, in that they were originally painted in [[tempera]] (egg yolk and ground pigments) on wooden panels.  In this respect, they share the Ancient Roman heritage of Byzantine icons.  Second, they share [[iconography]], or subject matter.  Each image stresses the maternal role that Mary plays, representing her in relationship to her infant son.  It is difficult to gauge the dates of the cluster of these earlier images, however, they seem to be primarily works of the 7th and 8th centuries.\n\n===Later medieval period===\nIt was not until the revival of monumental [[panel painting]] in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, that the image of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout [[Tuscany]].  While members of the [[mendicant orders]] of the [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Orders are some of the first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and homes.  Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.  Paying for such a work might also be seen as a form of devotion.  Its expense registers in the use of thin sheets of real [[gold leaf]] in all parts of the panel that are not covered with paint, a visual analogue not only to the costly sheaths that medieval [[goldsmith]]s used to decorate altars, but also a means of surrounding the image of the Madonna with illumination from oil lamps and candles.  Even more precious is the bright blue mantle colored with [[lapis lazuli]], a stone imported from Afghanistan.\n\nThis is the case of one of the most famous, innovative and monumental works that Duccio executed for the Laudesi at Santa Maria Novella in Florence.  Often the scale of the work indicates a great deal about its original function.  Often referred to as the Rucellia Madonna (c. 1285), the panel painting towers over the spectator, offering a visual focus for members of the Laudesi confraternity to gather before it as they sang praises to the image.  Duccio made an even grander image of the Madonna enthroned for the high altar of the cathedral of Siena, his home town.  Known as the ''Maesta'' (1308\u20131311), the image represents the pair as the center of a densely populated court in the central part of a complexly carpentered work that lifts the court upon a predella (pedestal of altarpiece) of narrative scenes and standing figures of prophets and saints.  In turn, a modestly scaled image of the Madonna as a half-length figure holding her son in a memorably intimate depiction, is to be found in the National Gallery of London.  This is clearly made for the private devotion of a Christian wealthy enough to hire one of the most important Italian artists of his day.\n\nThe privileged owner need not go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or she had to do was open the shutters of the tabernacle in an act of private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.\n\nDespite all of the innovations of painters of the Madonna during the 13th and 14th centuries, Mary can usually be recognized by virtue of her attire.  Customarily when she is represented as a youthful mother of her newborn child, she wears a deeply saturated blue mantle over a red garment.  This mantle typically covers her head, where sometimes, one might see a linen, or later, transparent silk veil.  She holds the Christ Child, or Baby Jesus, who shares her halo as well as her regal bearing.  Often her gaze is directed out at the viewer, serving as an intercessor, or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for prayers that flow from the Christian, to her, and only then, to her son. However, late medieval Italian artists also followed the trends of Byzantine icon painting, developing their own methods of depicting the Madonna. Sometimes, the Madonna's complex bond with her tiny child takes the form of a close, intimate moment of tenderness steeped in sorrow where she only has eyes for him.\n\nWhile the focus of this entry currently stresses the depiction of the Madonna in panel painting, her image also appears in mural decoration, whether mosaics or fresco painting on the exteriors and interior of sacred buildings.  She is found high above the apse, or east end of the church where the liturgy is celebrated in the West.  She is also found in sculpted form, whether small ivories for private devotion, or large sculptural reliefs and free-standing sculpture.  As a participant in sacred drama, her image inspires one of the most important fresco cycles in all of Italian painting: Giotto's narrative cycle in the Arena Chapel, next to the Scrovegni family's palace in Padua.  This program dates to the first decade of the 14th century.\n\nItalian artists of the 15th century onward are indebted to traditions established in the 13th and 14th centuries in their representation of the Madonna.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Gerard David - The rest on the flight into Egypt (National Gallery of Art).jpg|''[[Rest on the Flight into Egypt (David, National Gallery of Art)|Rest on The Flight into Egypt]]'', c. 1510,<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50.html National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.]</ref> by [[Gerard David]] depicts a close, intimate moment of tenderness where she only has eyes for the Child.\nFile:Don Lorenzo Monaco 013.jpg|[[Lorenzo Monaco]], [[Florence]], c. 1410\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance===\nWhile the 15th and 16th centuries were a time when Italian painters expanded their repertoire to include historical events, independent portraits and mythological subject matter, Christianity retained a strong hold on their careers.  Most works of art from this era are sacred.  While the range of religious subject matter included subjects from the Old Testament and images of saints whose cults date after the codification of the Bible, the Madonna remained a dominant subject in the iconography of the Renaissance.\n\nSome of the most eminent 16th-century Italian painters to turn to this subject were [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]],{{NoteTag|According to [[W.&nbsp;H. Wackenroder]], some writings by [[Bramante]] reveal that Raphael told him that he discovered how to paint his Madonnas in a visionary dream he had after praying to the Virgin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1-link=Mario Salmi |last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6-link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7-link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |year = 1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location = New York, NY |page = 622 }}</ref>}} [[Giorgione]], [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]]. They developed on the foundations of 15th-century Marian images by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] in particular, among countless others. The subject was equally popular in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and that of the rest of Northern Europe.\n\nThe subject retaining the greatest power on all of these men remained the maternal bond, even though other subjects, especially the [[Annunciation]], and later the [[Immaculate Conception]], led to a greater number of paintings that represented Mary alone, without her son.  As a commemorative image, the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]'' became an important subject, newly freed from its former role in narrative cycles, in part, an outgrowth of popular devotional statues in Northern Europe. Traditionally, Mary is depicted expressing compassion, grief and love, usually in highly charged, emotional works of art even though the most famous, early work by Michelangelo stifles signs of mourning. The tenderness an ordinary mother might feel towards her beloved child is captured, evoking the moment when she first held her infant son [[Christ]].  The spectator, after all, is meant to sympathize, to share in the despair of the mother who holds the body of her crucified son.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:15th-century unknown painters - Madonna on a Crescent Moon in Hortus Conclusus - WGA23736.jpg|The ''Madonna [[Woman of the Apocalypse|on a Crescent Moon]] in [[Hortus Conclusus]]'' by an [[anonymity|anonymous]] painter.\nFile:Leonardo da Vinci - study of a woman's head.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], a study of the Head of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Madonna]], c. 1484 AD.\n</gallery>\n\n===Modern images===\n[[File:La Vierge au lys.jpg|thumb|180px|''Virgin of the Lilies'', [[Bouguereau]], 1899]]\n\nIn some European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Poland sculptures of the Madonna are found on the outside of city houses and buildings, or along the roads in small enclosures.\n\nIn Germany, such a statue placed on the outside of a building is called a ''Hausmadonna''.

The show was produced by Charles/Burrows Productions in association with [[Paramount Television|Paramount Network Television]], and was created by the team of [[James Burrows]], [[Glen and Les Charles|Glen Charles, and Les Charles]]. The show is set in a bar named [[Cheers Beacon Hill|Cheers]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize. The show's main theme song, co-written and performed by [[Gary Portnoy]], lent its refrain \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]\" as the show's [[catchphrase]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Gary|last= Portnoy|date=2006|url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/|title=Portnoy's personal site|work=garyportnoy.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). ''Cheers'', however, eventually became a [[Nielsen ratings|highly rated]] television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"[[Must See TV]]\" lineup. Its [[List of most watched television broadcasts|widely watched]] [[series finale]] was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 275 [[List of Cheers episodes|episodes]] have been successfully [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] worldwide. Nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] for all eleven of its seasons on the air, it earned 28 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s from a record of 117 nominations. The character [[Frasier Crane]] ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) was featured in [[Frasier|his eponymous spin-off show]], which aired until 2004 and included guest appearances by virtually all of the major and minor ''Cheers'' characters.\n\nDuring its run, ''Cheers'' became one of the most popular series of all time and has received critical acclaim from its start to its end.

He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with [[Sam and Diane|Diane Chambers]], his class opposite, in the first five seasons (1982\u20131987). During their off-times, Sam has flings with many not-so-bright \"sexy women\",<ref name=honey264/> yet fails to pursue a meaningful relationship<ref name=honey264/> and fails to seduce other women, such as intellectuals. After Diane is written out of the series, he tries to pursue Rebecca Howe, with varying results.

Realizing that one of her few practical skills is memorization, which comes in handy when dealing with drink orders, she reluctantly becomes a barmaid. Later, she becomes a close friend of Coach<ref name=10anniversary/> and [[Sam and Diane|has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone]], her class opposite. During their off-relationship times, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane. In 1987, she leaves Boston behind for a writing career and to live in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Diane returns to Cheers to cure Sam of his drinking. Diane's biggest enemy is Carla but Diane doesn't insult Carla the way Carla does to Diane, which serves to annoy Carla even more.\n* [[Nicholas Colasanto]] as [[Coach Ernie Pantusso]]: <br/>A \"borderline senile\"<ref name=honey264/> co-bartender, widower, and retired baseball coach. Coach is also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane. He has a daughter, [[Lisa Pantusso|Lisa]] ([[Allyce Beasley]]). Coach listens to people's problems and solves them. However, other people also help resolve his own problems. In 1985, Coach died without explicit explanation, as Colasanto died of a heart attack.<ref name=colasantodeath/>\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as [[Carla Tortelli]]: <br/>A \"wisecracking, cynical\"<ref name=scott1982/> cocktail waitress, who treats customers badly. She is also highly fertile and matrimonially inept. When the series premiered, she is the mother of four children by her ex-husband [[Nick Tortelli]] ([[Dan Hedaya]]).

Carla sleeps with Sam's enemy John Allen Hill to Sam's annoyance and anger.\n* [[George Wendt]] as [[Norm Peterson]]: <br/>A bar regular and occasionally-employed [[accountant]]. A recurrent joke on the show, especially in the earlier seasons, was that the character was such a popular and constant fixture at the bar that anytime he entered through the front door everyone present would yell out his name (\"NORM!\") in greeting; usually this cry would be followed by one of the present bartenders asking Norm how he was, usually receiving a sardonic response and a request for a beer. (\"It's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm wearing Milkbone underwear.\") He has infrequent accounting jobs and a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an [[unseen character]], though is occasionally heard.

Frasier started out as Diane Chambers' love interest in the third season (1984\u201385). In the fourth season (1985\u201386), after Diane jilts him at the altar in Europe, Frasier ends up frequenting Cheers and becomes a regular. He later marries [[Lilith Sternin]] and has a son, Frederick.

In the final season, he runs for political office and, surprisingly, wins.\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as [[Lilith Sternin]]: <br/>A psychiatrist and bar regular. She is often teased by bar patrons about her uptight personality and appearance. In \"Second Time Around\" (1986), her first episode, also her only one of the fourth season, her date with Frasier does not go well because they constantly argue. In the fifth season, with help from Diane, Lilith and Frasier begin a relationship. Eventually, they marry and have a son, Frederick. In the eleventh and final season, she leaves Frasier to live with another man in an experimental underground environment called the \"Eco-pod.\" She returns later in the season and reconciles with Frasier. However, in the spinoff ''Frasier'', Lilith divorces Frasier and bears the custody of Frederick.\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as [[Rebecca Howe]]: <br/>She starts out as a strong independent woman, manager of the bar for the corporation that bought Cheers from Sam after his on-off relationship with Diane ended. Eventually, when Sam regains ownership, she begs him to let her remain as cocktail waitress.

Notable repeat guests included [[Dan Hedaya]] as [[Nick Tortelli]] and [[Jean Kasem]] as [[Loretta Tortelli]], who were the main characters in the first spin-off ''[[The Tortellis]]'', [[Fred Dryer]] as Dave Richards, [[Annie Golden]] as Margaret O'Keefe, [[Derek McGrath]] as Andy Schroeder (also referred to as ''Andy Andy''), interchangeably [[Joel Polis]] and [[Robert Desiderio]] as rival bar owner Gary, [[Jay Thomas]] as [[Eddie LeBec]], [[Roger Rees]] as [[Robin Colcord]], [[Tom Skerritt]] as [[Evan Drake]], [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Esther Clavin, [[Richard Doyle (actor)|Richard Doyle]] as Walter Gaines, [[Keene Curtis]] as John Allen Hill, [[Anthony Cistaro]] as Henri, Michael McGuire as Professor Sumner Sloan, and [[Harry Anderson]] as Harry 'The Hat' Gittes. [[Jackie Swanson]], who played the recurring role of Woody's girlfriend and eventual wife \"Kelly Gaines-Boyd\", appeared in 24 episodes from 1989 to 1993. The character is as equally dim and naive\u2014but ultimately as sweet-natured\u2014as Woody.\n\n[[Paul Willson]] played the recurring barfly character of \"Paul Krapence\". (In one early appearance in the first season he was called \"Glen\", and was later credited on-screen as \"Gregg\" and \"Tom\", but he was playing the same character throughout.) [[Thomas Babson]] played \"Tom\", a law student often mocked by [[Cliff Clavin]], for continually failing to pass the Massachusetts bar exam. \"Al\", played by [[Al Rosen (actor)|Al Rosen]], appeared in 38 episodes, and was known for his surly quips. Rhea Perlman's father Philip Perlman played the role of \"Phil\".<ref>{{cite magazine|date=September 16, 1991|title=Cheers, Dad!|url=https://people.com/archive/cheers-dad-vol-36-no-10|magazine=People|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity appearances===\nOther celebrities guest-starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Sports figures appeared on the show as themselves with a connection to Boston or Sam's former team, the Red Sox, such as [[Luis Tiant]], [[Wade Boggs]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] (of the [[Boston Celtics]]).<ref name=\"nba\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mchale_bio.html |title=Kevin McHale Bio |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |publisher=NBA }}</ref> Some television stars also made guest appearances as themselves such as [[Alex Trebek]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Robert Urich]], [[George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] and [[Johnny Carson]]. Various political figures even made appearances on ''Cheers'' such as then-[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William J. Crowe]], former [[Colorado]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Gary Hart]], then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]], then-Senator [[John Kerry]], then-[[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]], [[Ethel Kennedy]] (widow of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]), and then-[[Mayor of Boston]] [[Raymond Flynn]], the last five of whom all represented Cheers' home state and city.\n\nIn maternal roles, [[Glynis Johns]], in a guest appearance in 1983, played Diane's mother, Helen Chambers. [[Nancy Marchand]] played Frasier's mother, Hester Crane, in an episode that aired in 1985. In an episode that aired in 1992, [[Celeste Holm]] played Kelly's jokester of a paternal grandmother. [[Melendy Britt]] appeared in the episode \"''Woody or Won't He''\" (1990) as Kelly's mother, Roxanne Gaines, a very attractive high-society lady and a sexy, flirtatious upper-class cougar who tries to seduce Woody.\n\nThe musician [[Harry Connick Jr.]] appeared in an episode as Woody's cousin and plays a song from his Grammy-winning album ''[[We Are in Love]]'' ({{Circa|1991}}). [[John Cleese]] won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his guest appearance as \"Dr. Simon Finch-Royce\" in the fifth-season episode, \"Simon Says\". [[Emma Thompson]] guest-starred as [[Minor characters on Frasier|Nanny G/Nannette Guzman]], a famous singing nanny and Frasier's ex-wife. [[Christopher Lloyd]] guest-starred as a tortured artist who wanted to paint Diane. [[Marcia Cross]] portrayed Rebecca's sister Susan in the season 7 episode ''Sisterly Love''. [[John Mahoney]] once appeared as an inept jingle writer, which included a brief conversation with Frasier Crane, whose father he later portrayed on the spin-off ''Frasier''. [[Peri Gilpin]], who later played [[Roz Doyle]] on ''Frasier,'' also appeared in one episode of ''Cheers'', in its 11th season, as Holly Matheson, a reporter who interviews Woody. [[The Righteous Brothers]], [[Bobby Hatfield]] and [[Bill Medley]], also guest-starred in different episodes. In \"The Guy Can't Help It\" Rebecca, meets a plumber played by [[Tom Berenger]] who came to fix one of the beer keg taps. They marry in the series finale, triggering her resignation from Cheers. [[Judith Barsi]] appears in the episode ''Relief Bartender''.\n\nNotable guest appearances of actresses portraying Sam's sexual conquests or potential sexual conquests include: [[Kate Mulgrew]] in the three-episode finale of season four, portraying Boston councilwoman Janet Eldridge; [[Donna McKechnie]] as Debra, Sam's ex-wife (with whom he is on good terms), who pretends to be an intellectual in front of Diane; [[Barbara Babcock]] as Lana Marshall, a talent agent who specializes in representing male athletes, her clients with whom she routinely sleeps on demand; [[Julia Duffy]] as Rebecca Prout, a depressed intellectual friend of Diane's; [[Alison LaPlaca]] as magazine reporter Paula Nelson; [[Carol Kane]] as Amanda, who Sam eventually learns was a fellow patient at the sanitarium with Diane; [[Barbara Feldon]] as Lauren Hudson, Sam's annual Valentine's Day fling (in an homage to ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]''); [[Sandahl Bergman]] as Judy Marlowe, a longtime casual sex partner and whose now grown daughter, Laurie Marlowe ([[Chelsea Noble]]), who has always considered Sam a pseudo-father figure, Sam falls for; [[Madolyn Smith|Madolyn Smith-Osborne]] as Dr. Sheila Rydell, a colleague of Frasier and Lilith; [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Valerie Hill, John Allen Hill's daughter who Sam pursues if only to gain an upper hand in his business relationship with Hill; and [[Alexis Smith]] as Alice Anne Volkman, Rebecca's much older ex-professor. In season 9, episode 17, ''I'm Getting My Act Together and Sticking It in Your Face'', Sam, believing Rebecca wants a more serious relationship, pretends to be gay, his lover being a casual friend named Leon ([[Jeff McCarthy]])\u2014the plan ultimately leads to a kiss between Sam and Leon.\n\n===Death of Nicholas Colasanto===\nNear the end of production of the third season, the writers of ''Cheers'' had to deal with the death of one of the main actors. During the third season, [[Nicholas Colasanto]]'s heart condition (which had been diagnosed in the mid-1970s) had worsened. He had lost weight and was having trouble breathing during filming. Shortly before third season filming wrapped, Colasanto was hospitalized due to fluid in his lungs. Though he recovered, he was not cleared to return to work. While visiting the set in January 1985 to watch the filming of several episodes, co-star [[Shelley Long]] commented, \"I think we were all in denial. We were all glad he was there, but he lost a lot of weight.\" Co-star [[Rhea Perlman]] added, \"[He] wanted to be there so badly. He didn't want to be sick. He couldn't breathe well. It was hard. He was laboring all the time.\" Colasanto ultimately died of a [[heart attack]] at his home on February 12, 1985.<ref name=showmust/>\n\nThe third-season episodes of ''Cheers'' were filmed out of order, partly to accommodate the pregnancy of cast member Long. As a result, they already completed filming the season finale at the time of his death, which had scenes with Colasanto in it. In the third-season episodes that had not been filmed at this point, Coach is said to be \"away\" for various reasons.\n\nThe ''Cheers'' writing staff assembled in June 1985, at the start of the production of the fourth season, to discuss how to deal with the absence of Coach. They quickly discarded the idea that he might have moved away, as they felt he would never abandon his friends. In addition, as most viewers were aware of Colasanto's death, the writing staff decided to handle the situation more openly. The season four opener, \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\", dealt with Coach's death as well as introduced [[Woody Harrelson]], Colasanto's replacement.<ref name=showmust>{{cite book|title=The Show Must Go On: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|author=Snauffer, Douglas|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7864-3295-0|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movpod.in/gp3w6smdjos9 |title=Birth, Death, Love and Rice|publisher=Movpod.in |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Cheers episodes}}\n{{:List of Cheers episodes}}\n\n==Themes==\nNearly all of ''Cheers'' took place in the front room of the bar, but the characters often went into the rear pool room or the bar's office.<ref name=why>{{cite news|title= Why 'Cheers' Looks Sharp Each Week |work=Chicago Tribune|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230357_1_ted-danson-kiss-les-and-glen-charles|accessdate=October 30, 2010|date=March 30, 1986}}</ref> ''Cheers'' did not show any action outside the bar until the first episode of the second season, which took place in Diane's apartment.\n\nThe show's main [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] in its early seasons was the romance between intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and the bar's owner Sam Malone, a former [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[Pitcher|baseball pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and a recovering [[alcoholic]].<ref>''Television Heaven'' (2002)(2006).

As ''Toasting Cheers'' puts it, \"The script was further strengthened by the writers' boldness in successfully tackling controversial issues such as alcoholism, [[homosexuality]], and adultery.\"<ref name=Bix>Bjorklund, p. ix</ref>\n\n[[Social class]] was a subtext of the show. The \"upper class\"\u2014represented by characters like Diane Chambers, [[Frasier Crane]] and [[Lilith Sternin]]\u2014rubbed shoulders with middle- and working-class characters\u2014Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and a millionaire's daughter, [[List of recurring characters in Cheers|Kelly Gaines]]. Many viewers enjoyed ''Cheers'' in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.<ref name=\"chardevelop\"/>\n\n[[Feminism]] and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some critics seeing each of the major female characters portraying an aspect as a flawed feminist in her own way.<ref name=fem>Dr. Caren Deming. \"Talk: Gender Discourse in ''Cheers''!\", in ''Television Criticism: Approaches and Applications'' edited by Leah R.

Jenkins, who teaches at San Francisco State University.</ref> Diane was a vocal feminist, and Sam was the epitome of everything she hated: a [[Promiscuity|womanizer]] and a [[Chauvinism|male chauvinist]]. (See \"[[Sam and Diane]]\".)\n\nHomosexuality was dealt with from the first season, which was rare in the early [[List of years in television|1980s on American television]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Ron|title=Gay TV And Straight America|url=https://archive.org/details/gaytvstraightame0000beck|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick (N.J.)|isbn=978-0-8135-3689-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/gaytvstraightame0000beck/page/5 5]}}</ref> In the first-season episode \"[[The Boys in the Bar]]\" (the title being a reference to the [[The Boys in the Band (play)|play]] and subsequent movie ''[[The Boys in the Band (1970 film)|The Boys in the Band]]''), a friend and former teammate of Sam's [[Coming out|comes out]] in his autobiography. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not become a [[gay bar]]. The episode won a [[GLAAD]] [[GLAAD Media Award|Media Award]], and the script's writers, [[Ken Levine (screenwriter)|Ken Levine]] and David Isaacs, were nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].\n\n[[Substance use disorder|Addiction]] also plays a role in ''Cheers'', almost exclusively through Sam. He is a recovering [[alcoholic]] who had bought a bar during his drinking days. Frasier has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth-season episode \"The Triangle\", while Woody develops a [[problem gambling|gambling]] problem in the seventh season's \"Call Me Irresponsible\". Carla and other characters drink beer while pregnant, but nobody seems to mind.\n\n==Cheers owners==\n[[File:Boston5808.JPG|thumb|The Cheers sign in 2005]]\nCheers had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889. The \"Est. 1895\" on the bar's sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for [[numerology|numerological]] purposes, revealed in season 8, episode 6, \"The Stork Brings a Crane\", which also revealed the bar's address as 112{{Frac|1|2}} Beacon Street and that it originated under the name Mom's. In the series' second episode, \"Sam's Women\", Coach tells a customer looking for Gus, the owner of Cheers, that Gus was dead. In a later episode, Gus O'Mally comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.\n\nThe biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth-season finale, \"[[I Do, Adieu]]\", when Sam and Diane part ways, due to Shelley Long's departure from the series. In addition, Sam leaves on a trip to [[Circumnavigation|sail around the world]]. Before he leaves, Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. He returns in the sixth-season premiere, \"Home is the Sailor\", having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh-season premiere, \"How to Recede in Business\", Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca ([[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]) \"agree\" to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.\n\nFrom there Sam occasionally attempted to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved the wealthy executive [[Robin Colcord]]. Sam acquired Cheers again in the eighth-season finale, when it was sold back to him for 85\u00a2 by the Lillian Corporation, after he alerted the company to Colcord's [[insider trading]]. Fired by the corporation because of her silence on the issue, Rebecca is hired by Sam as a hostess/office manager. For the rest of the episode, to celebrate Sam's reclaiming the bar, a huge banner hung from the staircase, reading \"Under OLD Management\"!\n\nSam had two main battles, one with Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, trying to beat them at some activity or another but always failing, extending to the practical jokes they played on each other. The second was with Melville's owner John Hill who kept annoying Sam with his pettiness and ego. Hill had an ongoing relationship with Carla.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cheers Street Boston 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Cheers Beacon Hill]], formerly the Bull & Finch Pub, in Boston in 2005]]\n\n===Creation and concept===\nThree men developed and created the ''Cheers'' television series: The [[Glen and Les Charles|Charles brothers]]\u2014Glen and Les\u2014and [[James Burrows]],<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> who identified themselves as \"two Mormons and a Jew.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cheers-co-creator-looks-back-series-finale-ted-dansons-decision-quit-caught-us-surprise-120020648.html|title='Cheers' co-creator looks back at series finale: 'Ted Danson's decision to quit caught us by surprise'|publisher=}}</ref> They aimed at \"creating a show around a [[Spencer Tracy]]-[[Katharine Hepburn]]-type relationship\" between their two main characters, [[Sam and Diane|Sam Malone and Diane Chambers]].<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> Malone represents the average man, while Chambers represents class and sophistication.<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> The show revolves around characters in a bar under \"humorous adult themes\" and \"situations.\"<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/>\n\nThe original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a concept similar to ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The creators considered making an American version of the British ''[[Fawlty Towers]],'' set in a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the [[Radio programming|radio show]] ''[[Duffy's Tavern]],'' a program originally written and co-created by James Burrows' father [[Abe Burrows]]. They liked the idea of a [[tavern]], as it provided a continuous stream of new people, for a variety of characters.<ref name=B3>Bjorklund, p. 3.</ref>\n\nEarly discussions about the location of the show centered on [[Barstow, California]], then [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. They eventually turned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and finally Boston. The [[Bull & Finch Pub]] in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a [[phone book]].<ref name=B4>Bjorklund, p. 4.</ref> When Glen Charles asked the bar's owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he agreed, charging $1. Kershaw has since gone on to make millions of dollars, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of ''Cheers'' memorabilia. The Bull & Finch became the 42nd-busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997.<ref name=B3/> During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming ''[[A Small Circle of Friends]]'', remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, which turned out to be the Bull & Finch.<ref name=B7>Bjorklund, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Production team===\nThe crew of ''Cheers'' numbered in the hundreds. The three creators\u2014[[James Burrows]] and [[Glen and Les Charles|the Charles brothers, Glen and Les]]\u2014kept offices on Paramount's lot for the duration of the ''Cheers'' run. The Charles Brothers remained in overall charge throughout the show's run, frequently writing major episodes, though starting with the third season they began delegating the day-to-day running of the writing staff to various [[showrunner]]s. [[Ken Estin]] and [[Sam Simon]] were appointed as showrunners for the third season, and succeeded by [[David Angell]], [[Peter Casey (screenwriter)|Peter Casey]] and [[David Lee (screenwriter)|David Lee]] the following year. Angell, Casey and Lee would remain as showrunners until the end of the seventh season when they left to develop their own sitcom, ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'', and were replaced by Cheri Eichen, Bill Steinkellner and [[Phoef Sutton]] for the eighth through tenth seasons. For the final season, Tom Anderson and [[Dan O'Shannon]] acted as the showrunners.\n\nJames Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show's longevity, directing 243 of the 270 episodes and supervising the show's production.<ref name=B2>Bjorklund, p. 2.</ref> Among the show's other directors were [[Andy Ackerman]], Thomas Lofaro, Tim Berry, [[Tom Moore (director)|Tom Moore]], Rick Beren, as well as cast members John Ratzenberger and George Wendt.<ref name=\"chardevelop\">The Museum of Broadcast Communications (2006).</ref>\n\n[[Craig Safan]] provided the series' original music for its entire run except the theme song. His extensive compositions for the show led to his winning numerous [[ASCAP]] Top TV Series awards for his music.\n\n===Casting===\nThe character of [[Sam Malone]] was originally intended to be a retired football player and was slated to be played by [[Fred Dryer]], but, after casting Ted Danson, it was decided that a former baseball player (Sam \"Mayday\" Malone) would be more believable.<ref name=audition>Meade, Peter. \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19840427&printsec=frontpage We'll Cry In Our Beers As Sam, Diane Split].\" ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] TV Update'' [Spartanburg, NC] April 29, 1984: 14.

The character of [[Cliff Clavin]] was created for John Ratzenberger after he auditioned for the role of [[Norm Peterson]], which eventually went to George Wendt.

Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a [[read-through]], Friday was [[rehearsal]] day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted on using [[film stock]] rather than [[videotape]]. He was also noted for using motion in his directorial style, trying to constantly keep characters moving rather than standing still.<ref name=\"B7-8\">Bjorklund, p.&nbsp;7\u20138.</ref> During the first season when ratings were poor Paramount and NBC asked that the show use videotape to save money, but a poor test taping ended the experiment and ''Cheers'' continued to use film.<ref name=\"levine20120318\">{{cite web | url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2012/03/another-thing-about-cheers-you-didnt.html | title=Another thing about CHEERS you didn't know | work=...by Ken Levine | date=March 18, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2012 | author=Levine, Ken}}</ref>\n\nDue to a decision by Glen and Les Charles, the [[cold open]] was often not connected to the rest of the episode, with the lowest-ranked writers assigned to create the jokes for them.

When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were of the Bull & Finch Pub, located directly north of the [[Boston Public Garden]]. The pub has become a [[tourist attraction]] because of its association with the series, and draws nearly one million visitors annually.<ref name=B3/><ref name=\"synd1\"/> It has since been renamed [[Cheers Beacon Hill]]; its interior is different from the TV bar. The pub itself is at 84 Beacon Street (on the corner of Brimmer Street). In August 2001, there was a replica made of the bar in [[Faneuil Hall]] to capitalize on the popularity of the show.\n\n===Theme song===\nBefore \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]\", written by [[Gary Portnoy]] and [[Judy Hart Angelo]], became the show's theme song, ''Cheers''{{'}} producers rejected two of Portnoy's and Hart Angelo's songs. The songwriters had collaborated to provide music for ''Preppies'', an unsuccessful Broadway musical. When told they could not appropriate \"People Like Us\", ''Preppies''{{'}} opening song, the pair wrote another song \"My Kind of People\", which resembled \"People Like Us\" and intended to satirize \"the lifestyle of old decadent old-money [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]],\" but, to meet producers' demands, they rewrote the lyrics to be about \"likeable losers\" in a Boston bar. The show's producers rejected this song, as well. After they read the script of the series pilot, they created another song \"Another Day\". When Portnoy and Hart Angelo heard that NBC had commissioned thirteen episodes, they created an official theme song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" and rewrote the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118024640/http://www.garyportnoy.com/ |work=GaryPortnoy.com|url-status=live|title=The Story Behind the Cheers Theme}} Click \"The Cheers Story\".</ref> On syndicated airings of ''Cheers'', the theme song was shortened to make room for commercials.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Cheers'' was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of 77 shows in that year's ratings.<ref name=groove3>{{cite web|last=Anscher|first=Matthew|title=Part III: Brandon at the Bat|url=http://www.tvparty.com/80nbc3.html|work=How NBC Got Its Groove Back|publisher=tvparty.com|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref> This critical support, the early success at the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, and the support of the president of NBC's entertainment division [[Brandon Tartikoff]], are thought to be the main reasons for the show's survival and eventual success.<ref>''Variety'' (May 20, 2003) (2006).

By the second season ''Cheers'' was competitive with CBS's top-rated show ''[[Simon & Simon]]''.<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> With the growing popularity of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which ran in the slot ahead of ''Cheers'' from January 1984 until ''Family Ties'' was moved to Sundays in 1987, and the placement of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed \"[[Must See TV|Must See Thursday]]\". The next season, ''Cheers'' ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. By the end of its final season, the show had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the top ten of the [[Nielsen ratings]]; seven of them were in the top five.<ref name=B16>Bjorklund, p. 16.</ref>\n\nNBC dedicated a whole night to the [[One for the Road (Cheers)|final episode of ''Cheers'']], following the [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|one-hour season finale]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (which was its lead-in). The show began with a \"pregame\" show hosted by [[Bob Costas]], followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to ''Cheers'' during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show]]'' broadcast live from the Bull & Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|most-watched television episode]], it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 93.5&nbsp;million viewers (64 percent of all viewers that night), and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The 1993 final broadcast of ''Cheers'' also emerged as the highest rated broadcast of [[NBC]] to date, as well as the most watched single episode from any television series throughout the decade 1990s on U.S. television.<ref name=NYT>\"A Repeat of 'Cheers' Finale.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' May 22, 1993.

The show's success helped make such multi-episode story arcs popular on sitcoms, which Les Charles regrets.\n<blockquote>[W]e may have been partly responsible for what's going on now, where if you miss the first episode or two, you are lost. You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it. It can be very frustrating.\"{{r|gqraftery201210}}</blockquote>\n\n''Cheers'' began with a limited five-character ensemble consisting of Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman, Nicholas Colasanto and George Wendt. By the time season 10 began, the show had eight front characters in its roster. ''Cheers'' was also able to gradually phase in characters such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca, and Woody.\n\n===Awards and honors===\n{{main list|List of awards and nominations received by Cheers}}\nOver its eleven-season run, the ''Cheers'' cast and crew earned many awards. The show garnered a record 111 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, with a total of 28 wins.

In January 2011, [[Reelz]] Channel began airing the series in hour-long blocks. [[MeTV]] began airing ''Cheers'' weeknights in 2010. More recently, [[USA Network]] is rerunning the series on Sunday early mornings and weekday mornings to allow it to show extended length films of 2\u00bd hours and maintain symmetric schedules.\n\nAs of April 2011, [[Netflix]] began including ''Cheers'' as one of the titles on its \"watch instantly\" streaming service.

It was repeated several years later on Nine shortly after Packer's death in 2005. ''Cheers'' currently airs on [[10 Peach|Eleven]] (a digital channel of [[Network Ten]]) starting January 11, 2011 in Australia.

As of 2012, ''Cheers'' has been repeated on UK satellite channel [[CBS Drama]]. It has also been shown on the UK free-to-air channel [[ITV4]], with two episodes every weeknight. On March 16, 2015, the series began airing on UK subscription channel [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]] on weekdays at 9:30&nbsp;am and 10:00&nbsp;am.

In one example, for the episode \"Grease\", \"I Fought the Law\" was replaced; its removal affected the comedic value of the scenes it was originally in. Along with that the original 73 minute long finale (without commercials) is presented in its 3 part syndicated cut with a total runtime of all three parts estimating 70 minutes.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, they released ''Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers''.

The most successful ''Cheers'' spin-off was ''[[Frasier]]'', which featured Frasier Crane following his relocation back to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Sam, Diane, and Woody all individually appeared in ''Frasier'' episodes, with Lilith appearing as a guest on multiple episodes. In the [[Frasier (season 9)|season nine]] episode \"Cheerful Goodbyes\", Frasier returns to Boston and meets up with the Cheers gang, later attending Cliff's retirement party.\n\nAlthough ''[[Frasier]]'' was more successful, ''[[The Tortellis]]'' was the first series to spin off from ''Cheers'', premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla's ex-husband [[List of recurring characters in Cheers|Nick Tortelli and his wife Loretta]], but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian Americans.\n\nIn addition to direct spin-offs, several ''Cheers'' characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows, including ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' (episode \"[[St. Elsewhere#.22Cheers.22|Cheers]]\"). ''Cheers'' has also been spoofed or referenced in other media, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (spoofing the title sequence and theme song in \"[[Flaming Moe's]]\"; actually visiting the place with vocal role reprises of the majority of the principal cast in \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\"), ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (episode \"My Life in Four Cameras\"), ''[[Adventure Time]]'' (episode \"[[Simon & Marcy]]\"), the 2012 comedy film ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'', and the 2011 [[video game]] ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', Becker (Ted Danson), stops in at a bar, preferring to have a few drinks and get home in time to watch the Knicks game instead of attending his ex-wife's wedding in Connecticut. George Wendt is the bartender.\n\nIn the season 4 episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' entitled \"[[The Pitch (Seinfeld)|The Pitch]]\", Jerry and George are presenting their idea for a sitcom to NBC executives. George is unhappy with their offer and feels that he deserves the same salary as Ted Danson which he claims was $800,000 per episode, being that ''Cheers'' is also an NBC show. Danson's reported salary was actually $250,000 per episode. At this point Cheers was in its 10th season and Ted Danson had won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the year before.\n\nIn the 2015 video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'', set in Boston, there is a bar named 'Prost Bar' near Boston Common which, when entered, is an almost exact replica of the bar used in the series. It includes two dead bodies sat at the end of the bar, with one of them wearing a mail carrier's uniform, a direct reference to regular barfly [[Cliff Clavin]].<ref>[http://kotaku.com/theres-a-pretty-great-cheers-easter-egg-in-fallout-4-1741952100 There's a Pretty Great Cheers Easter Egg in Fallout 4]</ref>\n\nThe eighth anniversary special of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', airing in 1990, began with a scene at Cheers, in which the bar's TV gets stuck on NBC, and all of the bar patrons decide to go home instead of staying to watch [[David Letterman]]. The scene was re-used to open Letterman's final episode in 1993. A similar scene aired in the [[Super Bowl XVII]] Pregame Show on NBC, in which the characters briefly discuss the upcoming game.\n\nIn the second-season episode \"[[Swarley]]\" of the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', in the final scene, [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] walks into the bar and everyone shouts \"Swarley,\" same as when the characters traditionally yelled \"Norm!\" whenever [[Norm Peterson]] entered the Cheers bar, and he turns and walks out dejectedly as Carl the bartender plays \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name.\" The camera angle also changes to show the same bar set-up and framing for the main interior bar shots featured in ''Cheers''. Additionally, the end credits are done in the gold \"Cooper Black\" font of the ''Cheers'' credits (which was a highly popular font for sitcoms of the early to mid-1980s).\n\nThe ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' [[List of recurring Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters#Morn|character Morn]] is named for Norm Peterson due to [[Armin Shimerman]] calling the originally nameless character \"Norm\" between takes.\n\nThe theatrical play ''Cheers: Live On Stage'' reenacts a condensed version of the first two seasons of the show.<ref name=liveonstage>[http://cheersliveonstage.com/ ''Cheers Live On Stage''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918161014/http://cheersliveonstage.com/ |date=September 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOne episode of ''Cheers'' has a crossover reference to ''[[Spenser: For Hire]]'' (a Cheers bartender has a cameo appearance as an unspeaking extra).\n\nIn ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', [[Peter Quill]] makes numerous references to the show ''Cheers.''\n\nIn the [[The Good Place (season 2)|season 2 finale]] of the NBC sitcom ''[[The Good Place]]'', Ted Danson's character Michael appears as a bartender while wearing a blue plaid button-down, in a clear homage to Danson's character in ''Cheers''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/the-good-place-season-2-finale-ted-danson-cheers.html|title=The Good Place Finally Gave Ted Danson His Cheers Moment|last=Ivie|first=Devon|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', [[Dan Hedaya]]'s character Kamehl Butabi and his friends are listening to Emily ([[Molly Shannon]]) play the piano. She was playing the song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" which is clearly a reference to Hedaya's past as [[Nick Tortelli]] on ''Cheers''.\n\nIn 2019 members of the ''Cheers'' cast, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, John Ratzenberger and Kirstie Alley reprised their characters in an episode of [[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|''The Goldbergs'']] where they play customers of Geoff's short-lived food delivery business.\n\n==Remake==\nIn September 2011, Plural Entertainment debuted a remake of the series on [[Spain|Spanish]] television, also titled ''[[Cheers (Spanish TV series)|Cheers]]''. Set at an Irish pub, it starred [[Alberto San Juan]] as Nicol\u00e1s \"Nico\" Arnedo, the equivalent of Sam Malone in the original series. It also used the original theme song, rerecorded in Spanish by [[Dani Mart\u00edn]], under the title of \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name|D\u00f3nde la gente se divierte]].\"\n\nIn December 2012, The Irish Film and Television Network announced that casting was underway on an [[Irish-language]] version of ''Cheers'' produced by production company Sideline. The new show, tentatively titled ''Teach Se\u00e1n'', would air on Ireland's TG4 and features a main character who, like Sam Malone, is a bar owner, a retired athlete and a recovering alcoholic. However, because of being set in Ireland, the barman is a \"former [[hurling]] star\" rather than an ex-baseball player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2012/12/19/irish-cheers/|title= Irish TV channel to remake 'Cheers'|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> As of August 2019, the Irish remake has not occurred.\n\n==''Cheers: Live On Stage''==\nOn September 9, 2016, a stage adaptation called, ''Cheers: Live On Stage'', opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (Boston)|Shubert Theatre]] in Boston. Comprising pieces of the original TV series, the play was adapted by Erik Forrest Jackson. It was produced by Troika/Stageworks. The director was Matt Lenz. It starred Grayson Powell as Sam Malone, Jillian Louis as Diane Chambers, [[Barry Pearl]] as Ernie 'Coach' Pantusso, Sarah Sirotta as Carla Tortelli, Paul Vogt as Norm Peterson, and Buzz Roddy as Cliff Clavin.

The show is set in a bar named [[Cheers Beacon Hill|Cheers]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where a group of locals meet to drink, relax, and socialize. The show's main theme song, co-written and performed by [[Gary Portnoy]], lent its refrain \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]\" as the show's [[catchphrase]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Gary|last= Portnoy|date=2006|url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/|title=Portnoy's personal site|work=garyportnoy.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter premiering on September 30, 1982, it was nearly canceled during its first season when it ranked almost last in ratings for its premiere (74th out of 77 shows). ''Cheers'', however, eventually became a [[Nielsen ratings|highly rated]] television show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at number one. The show spent most of its run on NBC's Thursday night \"[[Must See TV]]\" lineup. Its [[List of most watched television broadcasts|widely watched]] [[series finale]] was broadcast on May 20, 1993, and the show's 275 [[List of Cheers episodes|episodes]] have been successfully [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] worldwide.

[[Lilith Sternin]] started as a one-time character in an episode of season four, \"Second Time Around\" (1985). After her second season five appearance, she became a recurring character, and was later featured as a permanent one during season ten (1991\u201392).\n\n===Original main characters===\n[[File:Cheers original cast 1982-86 (1983).jpg|thumb|Cast of seasons one through three, ''left to right'': ''(top)'' [[Shelley Long]], [[Ted Danson]]; ''(middle)'' [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Nicholas Colasanto]]; ''(bottom)'' [[George Wendt]], [[John Ratzenberger]] |alt=Background is the bar setting.

Before the series began, he was a baseball [[relief pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] nicknamed \"Mayday Malone\" until he became an [[alcoholic]], harming his career. He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with [[Sam and Diane|Diane Chambers]], his class opposite, in the first five seasons (1982\u20131987). During their off-times, Sam has flings with many not-so-bright \"sexy women\",<ref name=honey264/> yet fails to pursue a meaningful relationship<ref name=honey264/> and fails to seduce other women, such as intellectuals. After Diane is written out of the series, he tries to pursue Rebecca Howe, with varying results. At the end of the series, he is still unmarried and faces [[sexual addiction]] with the help of Dr. Robert Sutton's ([[Gilbert Lewis (actor)|Gilbert Lewis]]) group meetings, advised by Frasier.\n* [[Shelley Long]] as [[Diane Chambers]]: <br/>An academic, sophisticated graduate student attending Boston University.<ref name=scott1982/> In the pilot, Diane is abandoned by her fianc\u00e9, leaving her without a job, a man, or money. Realizing that one of her few practical skills is memorization, which comes in handy when dealing with drink orders, she reluctantly becomes a barmaid. Later, she becomes a close friend of Coach<ref name=10anniversary/> and [[Sam and Diane|has an on-and-off relationship with bartender Sam Malone]], her class opposite. During their off-relationship times, Diane dates men who fit her upper-class ideals, such as Frasier Crane. In 1987, she leaves Boston behind for a writing career and to live in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Diane returns to Cheers to cure Sam of his drinking. Diane's biggest enemy is Carla but Diane doesn't insult Carla the way Carla does to Diane, which serves to annoy Carla even more.\n* [[Nicholas Colasanto]] as [[Coach Ernie Pantusso]]: <br/>A \"borderline senile\"<ref name=honey264/> co-bartender, widower, and retired baseball coach. Coach is also a friend of Sam and a close friend of Diane. He has a daughter, [[Lisa Pantusso|Lisa]] ([[Allyce Beasley]]). Coach listens to people's problems and solves them. However, other people also help resolve his own problems. In 1985, Coach died without explicit explanation, as Colasanto died of a heart attack.<ref name=colasantodeath/>\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as [[Carla Tortelli]]: <br/>A \"wisecracking, cynical\"<ref name=scott1982/> cocktail waitress, who treats customers badly. She is also highly fertile and matrimonially inept. When the series premiered, she is the mother of four children by her ex-husband [[Nick Tortelli]] ([[Dan Hedaya]]). Over the course of the series, she bears four more, the depiction of which incorporated Perlman's real-life pregnancies.<ref name=top10preggerstime>\"[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1878293_1878320_1878375,00.html Top 10 Pregnant Performers: Where Everybody Knows You're Pregnant (or Not)].\" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

After he died in an ice show accident by an [[ice resurfacer]], Carla later discovers that Eddie had committed [[bigamy]] with another woman, whom he had gotten pregnant. Carla sleeps with Sam's enemy John Allen Hill to Sam's annoyance and anger.\n* [[George Wendt]] as [[Norm Peterson]]: <br/>A bar regular and occasionally-employed [[accountant]]. A recurrent joke on the show, especially in the earlier seasons, was that the character was such a popular and constant fixture at the bar that anytime he entered through the front door everyone present would yell out his name (\"NORM!\") in greeting; usually this cry would be followed by one of the present bartenders asking Norm how he was, usually receiving a sardonic response and a request for a beer. (\"It's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm wearing Milkbone underwear.\") He has infrequent accounting jobs and a troubled marriage with (but is still in love with and married to) Vera, an [[unseen character]], though is occasionally heard. Later in the series, he becomes a [[house painter]] and an [[interior decorator]]. Even later in the series, Norm secures his dream job, tasting beer at a brewery. The character was not originally intended to be a main cast role;<ref name=112wendt114/> Wendt auditioned for a minor role of George for the [[Give Me a Ring Sometime|pilot episode]].

He lives with his mother [[Esther Clavin]] ([[Frances Sternhagen]]) in first the family house and later an apartment. In the bar, Cliff continuously spouts nonsensical and annoying trivia, making him an object of derision to the bar patrons. Ratzenberger auditioned for the role of a minor character George, but it went to Wendt, evolving the role into Norm Peterson.<ref name=\"wendt113-114\"/> The producers decided they wanted a resident bar know-it-all,<ref name=\"wendt113-114\">Wendt 2009, pp.&nbsp;113\u2013114.</ref> so the security guard Cliff Clavin was added for the pilot.

Frasier started out as Diane Chambers' love interest in the third season (1984\u201385). In the fourth season (1985\u201386), after Diane jilts him at the altar in Europe, Frasier ends up frequenting Cheers and becomes a regular. He later marries [[Lilith Sternin]] and has a son, Frederick. After the series ends the character becomes the focus of the spin-off ''[[Frasier]]'', in which he is divorced from Lilith and living in [[Seattle]].\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[Woody Boyd]]: <br/>A not-so-bright<ref name=honey264/> bartender. He arrives from his Midwest hometown of [[Hanover, Indiana]] to Boston, to see Coach, his \"[[pen pal]]\" (as referring to exchanging \"pens\", not letters). When Sam tells Woody that Coach died, Sam hires Woody in Coach's place. Later, he marries his girlfriend Kelly Gaines ([[Jackie Swanson]]), also not-so-bright but raised in a rich family. In the final season, he runs for political office and, surprisingly, wins.\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as [[Lilith Sternin]]: <br/>A psychiatrist and bar regular. She is often teased by bar patrons about her uptight personality and appearance. In \"Second Time Around\" (1986), her first episode, also her only one of the fourth season, her date with Frasier does not go well because they constantly argue. In the fifth season, with help from Diane, Lilith and Frasier begin a relationship. Eventually, they marry and have a son, Frederick. In the eleventh and final season, she leaves Frasier to live with another man in an experimental underground environment called the \"Eco-pod.\" She returns later in the season and reconciles with Frasier. However, in the spinoff ''Frasier'', Lilith divorces Frasier and bears the custody of Frederick.\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as [[Rebecca Howe]]: <br/>She starts out as a strong independent woman, manager of the bar for the corporation that bought Cheers from Sam after his on-off relationship with Diane ended. Eventually, when Sam regains ownership, she begs him to let her remain as cocktail waitress.

Notable repeat guests included [[Dan Hedaya]] as [[Nick Tortelli]] and [[Jean Kasem]] as [[Loretta Tortelli]], who were the main characters in the first spin-off ''[[The Tortellis]]'', [[Fred Dryer]] as Dave Richards, [[Annie Golden]] as Margaret O'Keefe, [[Derek McGrath]] as Andy Schroeder (also referred to as ''Andy Andy''), interchangeably [[Joel Polis]] and [[Robert Desiderio]] as rival bar owner Gary, [[Jay Thomas]] as [[Eddie LeBec]], [[Roger Rees]] as [[Robin Colcord]], [[Tom Skerritt]] as [[Evan Drake]], [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Esther Clavin, [[Richard Doyle (actor)|Richard Doyle]] as Walter Gaines, [[Keene Curtis]] as John Allen Hill, [[Anthony Cistaro]] as Henri, Michael McGuire as Professor Sumner Sloan, and [[Harry Anderson]] as Harry 'The Hat' Gittes. [[Jackie Swanson]], who played the recurring role of Woody's girlfriend and eventual wife \"Kelly Gaines-Boyd\", appeared in 24 episodes from 1989 to 1993. The character is as equally dim and naive\u2014but ultimately as sweet-natured\u2014as Woody.\n\n[[Paul Willson]] played the recurring barfly character of \"Paul Krapence\". (In one early appearance in the first season he was called \"Glen\", and was later credited on-screen as \"Gregg\" and \"Tom\", but he was playing the same character throughout.) [[Thomas Babson]] played \"Tom\", a law student often mocked by [[Cliff Clavin]], for continually failing to pass the Massachusetts bar exam. \"Al\", played by [[Al Rosen (actor)|Al Rosen]], appeared in 38 episodes, and was known for his surly quips. Rhea Perlman's father Philip Perlman played the role of \"Phil\".<ref>{{cite magazine|date=September 16, 1991|title=Cheers, Dad!|url=https://people.com/archive/cheers-dad-vol-36-no-10|magazine=People|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity appearances===\nOther celebrities guest-starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Sports figures appeared on the show as themselves with a connection to Boston or Sam's former team, the Red Sox, such as [[Luis Tiant]], [[Wade Boggs]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] (of the [[Boston Celtics]]).<ref name=\"nba\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mchale_bio.html |title=Kevin McHale Bio |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |publisher=NBA }}</ref> Some television stars also made guest appearances as themselves such as [[Alex Trebek]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Robert Urich]], [[George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] and [[Johnny Carson]]. Various political figures even made appearances on ''Cheers'' such as then-[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William J. Crowe]], former [[Colorado]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Gary Hart]], then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]], then-Senator [[John Kerry]], then-[[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]], [[Ethel Kennedy]] (widow of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]), and then-[[Mayor of Boston]] [[Raymond Flynn]], the last five of whom all represented Cheers' home state and city.\n\nIn maternal roles, [[Glynis Johns]], in a guest appearance in 1983, played Diane's mother, Helen Chambers. [[Nancy Marchand]] played Frasier's mother, Hester Crane, in an episode that aired in 1985. In an episode that aired in 1992, [[Celeste Holm]] played Kelly's jokester of a paternal grandmother. [[Melendy Britt]] appeared in the episode \"''Woody or Won't He''\" (1990) as Kelly's mother, Roxanne Gaines, a very attractive high-society lady and a sexy, flirtatious upper-class cougar who tries to seduce Woody.\n\nThe musician [[Harry Connick Jr.]] appeared in an episode as Woody's cousin and plays a song from his Grammy-winning album ''[[We Are in Love]]'' ({{Circa|1991}}). [[John Cleese]] won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for his guest appearance as \"Dr. Simon Finch-Royce\" in the fifth-season episode, \"Simon Says\". [[Emma Thompson]] guest-starred as [[Minor characters on Frasier|Nanny G/Nannette Guzman]], a famous singing nanny and Frasier's ex-wife. [[Christopher Lloyd]] guest-starred as a tortured artist who wanted to paint Diane. [[Marcia Cross]] portrayed Rebecca's sister Susan in the season 7 episode ''Sisterly Love''. [[John Mahoney]] once appeared as an inept jingle writer, which included a brief conversation with Frasier Crane, whose father he later portrayed on the spin-off ''Frasier''. [[Peri Gilpin]], who later played [[Roz Doyle]] on ''Frasier,'' also appeared in one episode of ''Cheers'', in its 11th season, as Holly Matheson, a reporter who interviews Woody. [[The Righteous Brothers]], [[Bobby Hatfield]] and [[Bill Medley]], also guest-starred in different episodes. In \"The Guy Can't Help It\" Rebecca, meets a plumber played by [[Tom Berenger]] who came to fix one of the beer keg taps. They marry in the series finale, triggering her resignation from Cheers. [[Judith Barsi]] appears in the episode ''Relief Bartender''.\n\nNotable guest appearances of actresses portraying Sam's sexual conquests or potential sexual conquests include: [[Kate Mulgrew]] in the three-episode finale of season four, portraying Boston councilwoman Janet Eldridge; [[Donna McKechnie]] as Debra, Sam's ex-wife (with whom he is on good terms), who pretends to be an intellectual in front of Diane; [[Barbara Babcock]] as Lana Marshall, a talent agent who specializes in representing male athletes, her clients with whom she routinely sleeps on demand; [[Julia Duffy]] as Rebecca Prout, a depressed intellectual friend of Diane's; [[Alison LaPlaca]] as magazine reporter Paula Nelson; [[Carol Kane]] as Amanda, who Sam eventually learns was a fellow patient at the sanitarium with Diane; [[Barbara Feldon]] as Lauren Hudson, Sam's annual Valentine's Day fling (in an homage to ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]''); [[Sandahl Bergman]] as Judy Marlowe, a longtime casual sex partner and whose now grown daughter, Laurie Marlowe ([[Chelsea Noble]]), who has always considered Sam a pseudo-father figure, Sam falls for; [[Madolyn Smith|Madolyn Smith-Osborne]] as Dr. Sheila Rydell, a colleague of Frasier and Lilith; [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Valerie Hill, John Allen Hill's daughter who Sam pursues if only to gain an upper hand in his business relationship with Hill; and [[Alexis Smith]] as Alice Anne Volkman, Rebecca's much older ex-professor. In season 9, episode 17, ''I'm Getting My Act Together and Sticking It in Your Face'', Sam, believing Rebecca wants a more serious relationship, pretends to be gay, his lover being a casual friend named Leon ([[Jeff McCarthy]])\u2014the plan ultimately leads to a kiss between Sam and Leon.\n\n===Death of Nicholas Colasanto===\nNear the end of production of the third season, the writers of ''Cheers'' had to deal with the death of one of the main actors. During the third season, [[Nicholas Colasanto]]'s heart condition (which had been diagnosed in the mid-1970s) had worsened. He had lost weight and was having trouble breathing during filming. Shortly before third season filming wrapped, Colasanto was hospitalized due to fluid in his lungs. Though he recovered, he was not cleared to return to work. While visiting the set in January 1985 to watch the filming of several episodes, co-star [[Shelley Long]] commented, \"I think we were all in denial. We were all glad he was there, but he lost a lot of weight.\" Co-star [[Rhea Perlman]] added, \"[He] wanted to be there so badly. He didn't want to be sick. He couldn't breathe well. It was hard. He was laboring all the time.\" Colasanto ultimately died of a [[heart attack]] at his home on February 12, 1985.<ref name=showmust/>\n\nThe third-season episodes of ''Cheers'' were filmed out of order, partly to accommodate the pregnancy of cast member Long. As a result, they already completed filming the season finale at the time of his death, which had scenes with Colasanto in it. In the third-season episodes that had not been filmed at this point, Coach is said to be \"away\" for various reasons.\n\nThe ''Cheers'' writing staff assembled in June 1985, at the start of the production of the fourth season, to discuss how to deal with the absence of Coach. They quickly discarded the idea that he might have moved away, as they felt he would never abandon his friends. In addition, as most viewers were aware of Colasanto's death, the writing staff decided to handle the situation more openly. The season four opener, \"Birth, Death, Love and Rice\", dealt with Coach's death as well as introduced [[Woody Harrelson]], Colasanto's replacement.<ref name=showmust>{{cite book|title=The Show Must Go On: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|author=Snauffer, Douglas|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7864-3295-0|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movpod.in/gp3w6smdjos9 |title=Birth, Death, Love and Rice|publisher=Movpod.in |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Cheers episodes}}\n{{:List of Cheers episodes}}\n\n==Themes==\nNearly all of ''Cheers'' took place in the front room of the bar, but the characters often went into the rear pool room or the bar's office.<ref name=why>{{cite news|title= Why 'Cheers' Looks Sharp Each Week |work=Chicago Tribune|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230357_1_ted-danson-kiss-les-and-glen-charles|accessdate=October 30, 2010|date=March 30, 1986}}</ref> ''Cheers'' did not show any action outside the bar until the first episode of the second season, which took place in Diane's apartment.\n\nThe show's main [[Theme (narrative)|theme]] in its early seasons was the romance between intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and the bar's owner Sam Malone, a former [[Major League Baseball|major league]] [[Pitcher|baseball pitcher]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and a recovering [[alcoholic]].<ref>''Television Heaven'' (2002)(2006).

An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and a millionaire's daughter, [[List of recurring characters in Cheers|Kelly Gaines]]. Many viewers enjoyed ''Cheers'' in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.<ref name=\"chardevelop\"/>\n\n[[Feminism]] and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some critics seeing each of the major female characters portraying an aspect as a flawed feminist in her own way.<ref name=fem>Dr. Caren Deming. \"Talk: Gender Discourse in ''Cheers''!\", in ''Television Criticism: Approaches and Applications'' edited by Leah R.

Frasier has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth-season episode \"The Triangle\", while Woody develops a [[problem gambling|gambling]] problem in the seventh season's \"Call Me Irresponsible\". Carla and other characters drink beer while pregnant, but nobody seems to mind.\n\n==Cheers owners==\n[[File:Boston5808.JPG|thumb|The Cheers sign in 2005]]\nCheers had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889. The \"Est. 1895\" on the bar's sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for [[numerology|numerological]] purposes, revealed in season 8, episode 6, \"The Stork Brings a Crane\", which also revealed the bar's address as 112{{Frac|1|2}} Beacon Street and that it originated under the name Mom's.

In a later episode, Gus O'Mally comes back from Arizona for one night and helps run the bar.\n\nThe biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth-season finale, \"[[I Do, Adieu]]\", when Sam and Diane part ways, due to Shelley Long's departure from the series. In addition, Sam leaves on a trip to [[Circumnavigation|sail around the world]]. Before he leaves, Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation. He returns in the sixth-season premiere, \"Home is the Sailor\", having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. In the seventh-season premiere, \"How to Recede in Business\", Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca ([[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]) \"agree\" to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her.\n\nFrom there Sam occasionally attempted to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved the wealthy executive [[Robin Colcord]]. Sam acquired Cheers again in the eighth-season finale, when it was sold back to him for 85\u00a2 by the Lillian Corporation, after he alerted the company to Colcord's [[insider trading]]. Fired by the corporation because of her silence on the issue, Rebecca is hired by Sam as a hostess/office manager. For the rest of the episode, to celebrate Sam's reclaiming the bar, a huge banner hung from the staircase, reading \"Under OLD Management\"!\n\nSam had two main battles, one with Gary's Olde Towne Tavern, trying to beat them at some activity or another but always failing, extending to the practical jokes they played on each other. The second was with Melville's Owner John Hill who kept annoying Sam with his pettiness and ego. Hill had an ongoing relationship with Carla.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cheers Street Boston 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Cheers Beacon Hill]], formerly the Bull & Finch Pub, in Boston in 2005]]\n\n===Creation and concept===\nThree men developed and created the ''Cheers'' television series: The [[Glen and Les Charles|Charles brothers]]\u2014Glen and Les\u2014and [[James Burrows]],<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> who identified themselves as \"two Mormons and a Jew.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cheers-co-creator-looks-back-series-finale-ted-dansons-decision-quit-caught-us-surprise-120020648.html|title='Cheers' co-creator looks back at series finale: 'Ted Danson's decision to quit caught us by surprise'|publisher=}}</ref> They aimed at \"creating a show around a [[Spencer Tracy]]-[[Katharine Hepburn]]-type relationship\" between their two main characters, [[Sam and Diane|Sam Malone and Diane Chambers]].<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> Malone represents the average man, while Chambers represents class and sophistication.<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> The show revolves around characters in a bar under \"humorous adult themes\" and \"situations.\"<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/>\n\nThe original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, the goal being a concept similar to ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''. The creators considered making an American version of the British ''[[Fawlty Towers]],'' set in a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting, the show began to resemble the [[Radio programming|radio show]] ''[[Duffy's Tavern]],'' a program originally written and co-created by James Burrows' father [[Abe Burrows]]. They liked the idea of a [[tavern]], as it provided a continuous stream of new people, for a variety of characters.<ref name=B3>Bjorklund, p. 3.</ref>\n\nEarly discussions about the location of the show centered on [[Barstow, California]], then [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. They eventually turned to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and finally Boston. The [[Bull & Finch Pub]] in Boston, which was the model for Cheers, was chosen from a [[phone book]].<ref name=B4>Bjorklund, p. 4.</ref> When Glen Charles asked the bar's owner, Tom Kershaw, to shoot exterior and interior photos, he agreed, charging $1. Kershaw has since gone on to make millions of dollars, licensing the pub's image and selling a variety of ''Cheers'' memorabilia. The Bull & Finch became the 42nd-busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997.<ref name=B3/> During initial casting, Shelley Long, who was in Boston at the time filming ''[[A Small Circle of Friends]]'', remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in the city, which turned out to be the Bull & Finch.<ref name=B7>Bjorklund, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Production team===\nThe crew of ''Cheers'' numbered in the hundreds. The three creators\u2014[[James Burrows]] and [[Glen and Les Charles|the Charles brothers, Glen and Les]]\u2014kept offices on Paramount's lot for the duration of the ''Cheers'' run. The Charles Brothers remained in overall charge throughout the show's run, frequently writing major episodes, though starting with the third season they began delegating the day-to-day running of the writing staff to various [[showrunner]]s. [[Ken Estin]] and [[Sam Simon]] were appointed as showrunners for the third season, and succeeded by [[David Angell]], [[Peter Casey (screenwriter)|Peter Casey]] and [[David Lee (screenwriter)|David Lee]] the following year. Angell, Casey and Lee would remain as showrunners until the end of the seventh season when they left to develop their own sitcom, ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'', and were replaced by Cheri Eichen, Bill Steinkellner and [[Phoef Sutton]] for the eighth through tenth seasons. For the final season, Tom Anderson and [[Dan O'Shannon]] acted as the showrunners.\n\nJames Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show's longevity, directing 243 of the 270 episodes and supervising the show's production.<ref name=B2>Bjorklund, p. 2.</ref> Among the show's other directors were [[Andy Ackerman]], Thomas Lofaro, Tim Berry, [[Tom Moore (director)|Tom Moore]], Rick Beren, as well as cast members John Ratzenberger and George Wendt.<ref name=\"chardevelop\">The Museum of Broadcast Communications (2006).</ref>\n\n[[Craig Safan]] provided the series' original music for its entire run except the theme song. His extensive compositions for the show led to his winning numerous [[ASCAP]] Top TV Series awards for his music.\n\n===Casting===\nThe character of [[Sam Malone]] was originally intended to be a retired football player and was slated to be played by [[Fred Dryer]], but, after casting Ted Danson, it was decided that a former baseball player (Sam \"Mayday\" Malone) would be more believable.<ref name=audition>Meade, Peter. \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=SFOYbPikdlgC&dat=19840427&printsec=frontpage We'll Cry In Our Beers As Sam, Diane Split].\" ''[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] TV Update'' [Spartanburg, NC] April 29, 1984: 14.

The character of [[Cliff Clavin]] was created for John Ratzenberger after he auditioned for the role of [[Norm Peterson]], which eventually went to George Wendt. While chatting with producers afterward, he asked if they were going to include a \"bar know-it-all\", the part which he eventually played.<ref>Newport Under the Stars (2005)(2006).

Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a [[read-through]], Friday was [[rehearsal]] day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted on using [[film stock]] rather than [[videotape]]. He was also noted for using motion in his directorial style, trying to constantly keep characters moving rather than standing still.<ref name=\"B7-8\">Bjorklund, p.&nbsp;7\u20138.</ref> During the first season when ratings were poor Paramount and NBC asked that the show use videotape to save money, but a poor test taping ended the experiment and ''Cheers'' continued to use film.<ref name=\"levine20120318\">{{cite web | url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2012/03/another-thing-about-cheers-you-didnt.html | title=Another thing about CHEERS you didn't know | work=...by Ken Levine | date=March 18, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2012 | author=Levine, Ken}}</ref>\n\nDue to a decision by Glen and Les Charles, the [[cold open]] was often not connected to the rest of the episode, with the lowest-ranked writers assigned to create the jokes for them. Some cold opens were taken from episodes that ran too long.<ref name=levine20110128>{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Ken|title=My favorite CHEERS teaser|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/01/my-favorite-cheers-teaser.html|accessdate=January 28, 2011|newspaper=...by Ken Levine|date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first year of the show took place entirely within the confines of the bar, the first location outside the bar being Diane's apartment. When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were of the Bull & Finch Pub, located directly north of the [[Boston Public Garden]]. The pub has become a [[tourist attraction]] because of its association with the series, and draws nearly one million visitors annually.<ref name=B3/><ref name=\"synd1\"/> It has since been renamed [[Cheers Beacon Hill]]; its interior is different from the TV bar. The pub itself is at 84 Beacon Street (on the corner of Brimmer Street). In August 2001, there was a replica made of the bar in [[Faneuil Hall]] to capitalize on the popularity of the show.\n\n===Theme song===\nBefore \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]\", written by [[Gary Portnoy]] and [[Judy Hart Angelo]], became the show's theme song, ''Cheers''{{'}} producers rejected two of Portnoy's and Hart Angelo's songs. The songwriters had collaborated to provide music for ''Preppies'', an unsuccessful Broadway musical. When told they could not appropriate \"People Like Us\", ''Preppies''{{'}} opening song, the pair wrote another song \"My Kind of People\", which resembled \"People Like Us\" and intended to satirize \"the lifestyle of old decadent old-money [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]],\" but, to meet producers' demands, they rewrote the lyrics to be about \"likeable losers\" in a Boston bar. The show's producers rejected this song, as well. After they read the script of the series pilot, they created another song \"Another Day\". When Portnoy and Hart Angelo heard that NBC had commissioned thirteen episodes, they created an official theme song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" and rewrote the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|archivedate=January 18, 2013|url=http://www.garyportnoy.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118024640/http://www.garyportnoy.com/ |work=GaryPortnoy.com|url-status=live|title=The Story Behind the Cheers Theme}} Click \"The Cheers Story\".</ref> On syndicated airings of ''Cheers'', the theme song was shortened to make room for commercials.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Cheers'' was critically acclaimed in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th out of 77 shows in that year's ratings.<ref name=groove3>{{cite web|last=Anscher|first=Matthew|title=Part III: Brandon at the Bat|url=http://www.tvparty.com/80nbc3.html|work=How NBC Got Its Groove Back|publisher=tvparty.com|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref> This critical support, the early success at the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, and the support of the president of NBC's entertainment division [[Brandon Tartikoff]], are thought to be the main reasons for the show's survival and eventual success.<ref>''Variety'' (May 20, 2003) (2006).

By the second season ''Cheers'' was competitive with CBS's top-rated show ''[[Simon & Simon]]''.<ref name=Kerr_11_29_1983/> With the growing popularity of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which ran in the slot ahead of ''Cheers'' from January 1984 until ''Family Ties'' was moved to Sundays in 1987, and the placement of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' in front of both at the start of their third season (1984), the line-up became a runaway ratings success that NBC eventually dubbed \"[[Must See TV|Must See Thursday]]\". The next season, ''Cheers'' ratings increased dramatically after Woody Boyd became a regular character as well. By the end of its final season, the show had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the top ten of the [[Nielsen ratings]]; seven of them were in the top five.<ref name=B16>Bjorklund, p. 16.</ref>\n\nNBC dedicated a whole night to the [[One for the Road (Cheers)|final episode of ''Cheers'']], following the [[The Pilot (Seinfeld)|one-hour season finale]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' (which was its lead-in). The show began with a \"pregame\" show hosted by [[Bob Costas]], followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. NBC affiliates then aired tributes to ''Cheers'' during their local newscasts, and the night concluded with a special ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|Tonight Show]]'' broadcast live from the Bull & Finch Pub. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts|most-watched television episode]], it was the most watched show that year, bringing in 93.5&nbsp;million viewers (64 percent of all viewers that night), and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The 1993 final broadcast of ''Cheers'' also emerged as the highest rated broadcast of [[NBC]] to date, as well as the most watched single episode from any television series throughout the decade 1990s on U.S. television.<ref name=NYT>\"A Repeat of 'Cheers' Finale.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' May 22, 1993.

The show's success helped make such multi-episode story arcs popular on sitcoms, which Les Charles regrets.\n<blockquote>[W]e may have been partly responsible for what's going on now, where if you miss the first episode or two, you are lost. You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it. It can be very frustrating.\"{{r|gqraftery201210}}</blockquote>\n\n''Cheers'' began with a limited five-character ensemble consisting of Ted Danson, Shelley Long, Rhea Perlman, Nicholas Colasanto and George Wendt. By the time season 10 began, the show had eight front characters in its roster. ''Cheers'' was also able to gradually phase in characters such as Cliff, Frasier, Lilith, Rebecca, and Woody.\n\n===Awards and honors===\n{{main list|List of awards and nominations received by Cheers}}\nOver its eleven-season run, the ''Cheers'' cast and crew earned many awards.

Originally shot on film (but transferred to and edited on videotape) the program was broadcast in a 4:3 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], the newly transferred versions are in 16:9.{{original research inline|date=December 2011}} However, in the United Kingdom, the HD repeats on ITV4 HD, and later Channel 4 HD are shown in the original 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\n===Home media===\n[[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]] and (from 2006 onward) [[CBS Home Entertainment]] have released all 11 seasons of ''Cheers'' on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in Region 1, Region 2 and Region 4.\nIn the US, the last three seasons had music substitutions. In one example, for the episode \"Grease\", \"I Fought the Law\" was replaced; its removal affected the comedic value of the scenes it was originally in. Along with that the original 73 minute long finale (without commercials) is presented in its 3 part syndicated cut with a total runtime of all three parts estimating 70 minutes.\n\nOn March 6, 2012, they released ''Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers''. Based on the 2012 [[Facebook]] poll, the selected episodes are:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/55524/fan-favorites-the-best-of-cheers/ |date=April 8, 2012 |title=Fan Favorites: The Best of Cheers |work=[[DVD Talk]] |last=Hartel |first=Nick }}</ref>\n\n# \"[[Give Me a Ring Sometime]]\" (season 1, episode 1)\n# \"Diane's Perfect Date\" (season 1, episode 17)\n# \"Pick a Con, Any Con\" (season 1, episode 19)\n# \"Abnormal Psychology\" (season 5, episode 4)\n# \"[[Thanksgiving Orphans]]\" (season 5, episode 9)\n# \"Dinner at Eight-ish\" (season 5, episode 20)\n# \"Simon Says\" (season 5, episode 21)\n# \"An Old Fashioned Wedding\", parts one and two (season 10, episodes 25)\n\nOn May 5, 2015, CBS DVD released ''Cheers - The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Cheers-The-Complete-Series/20744|title=Cheers DVD news: Announcement for Cheers - The Complete Series - TVShowsOnDVD.com|work=tvshowsondvd.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210025845/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Cheers-The-Complete-Series/20744|archivedate=February 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Digital media distribution===\nThe complete eleven seasons of ''Cheers'' are available through the United States [[Netflix]] streaming service, the [[iTunes]] Store, Amazon [[Prime Video]], and [[Hulu]].

Paramount's licensing group, led by [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]], developed the ''Cheers'' pub concept initially in partnership with Host Marriott, which placed ''Cheers'' themed pubs in over 15 airports around the world.<ref name=\"BF\">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3469/is_n31_v46/ai_17364989/|title=Host Marriot now has eight airport \"micro\" pubs, more on the way|date=July 31, 1995|publisher=Business Journals, Inc|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> Boston boasts the original ''Cheers'' bar, historically known to Boston insiders as the Bull and Finch, as well as a Cheers restaurant in the Faneuil Hall marketplace, and Sam's Place, a spin-off sports bar concept also located at Faneuil Hall. In 1997 Europe's first officially licensed ''Cheers'' bar opened in London's Regent's Street W1. Like Cheers Faneuil Hall, Cheers London is a replica of the set. The gala opening was attended by James Burrows and cast members George Wendt and John Ratzenberger.<ref>''USA Today'' (September 23, 1997).</ref> The ''Cheers'' bar in London closed on 31 December 2008.

The most successful ''Cheers'' spin-off was ''[[Frasier]]'', which featured Frasier Crane following his relocation back to [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Sam, Diane, and Woody all individually appeared in ''Frasier'' episodes, with Lilith appearing as a guest on multiple episodes. In the [[Frasier (season 9)|season nine]] episode \"Cheerful Goodbyes\", Frasier returns to Boston and meets up with the Cheers gang, later attending Cliff's retirement party.\n\nAlthough ''[[Frasier]]'' was more successful, ''[[The Tortellis]]'' was the first series to spin off from ''Cheers'', premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla's ex-husband [[List of recurring characters in Cheers|Nick Tortelli and his wife Loretta]], but was canceled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian Americans.\n\nIn addition to direct spin-offs, several ''Cheers'' characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows, including ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' (episode \"[[St. Elsewhere#.22Cheers.22|Cheers]]\"). ''Cheers'' has also been spoofed or referenced in other media, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (spoofing the title sequence and theme song in \"[[Flaming Moe's]]\"; actually visiting the place with vocal role reprises of the majority of the principal cast in \"[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]\"), ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (episode \"My Life in Four Cameras\"), ''[[Adventure Time]]'' (episode \"[[Simon & Marcy]]\"), the 2012 comedy film ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]'', and the 2011 [[video game]] ''[[Dragon Age II]]''.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', Becker (Ted Danson), stops in at a bar, preferring to have a few drinks and get home in time to watch the Knicks game instead of attending his ex-wife's wedding in Connecticut. George Wendt is the bartender.\n\nIn the season 4 episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' entitled \"[[The Pitch (Seinfeld)|The Pitch]]\", Jerry and George are presenting their idea for a sitcom to NBC executives. George is unhappy with their offer and feels that he deserves the same salary as Ted Danson which he claims was $800,000 per episode, being that ''Cheers'' is also an NBC show. Danson's reported salary was actually $250,000 per episode. At this point Cheers was in its 10th season and Ted Danson had won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the year before.\n\nIn the 2015 video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'', set in Boston, there is a bar named 'Prost Bar' near Boston Common which, when entered, is an almost exact replica of the bar used in the series. It includes two dead bodies sat at the end of the bar, with one of them wearing a mail carrier's uniform, a direct reference to regular barfly [[Cliff Clavin]].<ref>[http://kotaku.com/theres-a-pretty-great-cheers-easter-egg-in-fallout-4-1741952100 There's a Pretty Great Cheers Easter Egg in Fallout 4]</ref>\n\nThe eighth anniversary special of ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', airing in 1990, began with a scene at Cheers, in which the bar's TV gets stuck on NBC, and all of the bar patrons decide to go home instead of staying to watch [[David Letterman]]. The scene was re-used to open Letterman's final episode in 1993. A similar scene aired in the [[Super Bowl XVII]] Pregame Show on NBC, in which the characters briefly discuss the upcoming game.\n\nIn the second-season episode \"[[Swarley]]\" of the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', in the final scene, [[Barney Stinson|Barney]] walks into the bar and everyone shouts \"Swarley,\" same as when the characters traditionally yelled \"Norm!\" whenever [[Norm Peterson]] entered the Cheers bar, and he turns and walks out dejectedly as Carl the bartender plays \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name.\" The camera angle also changes to show the same bar set-up and framing for the main interior bar shots featured in ''Cheers''. Additionally, the end credits are done in the gold \"Cooper Black\" font of the ''Cheers'' credits (which was a highly popular font for sitcoms of the early to mid-1980s).\n\nThe ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' [[List of recurring Star Trek: Deep Space Nine characters#Morn|character Morn]] is named for Norm Peterson due to [[Armin Shimerman]] calling the originally nameless character \"Norm\" between takes.\n\nThe theatrical play ''Cheers: Live On Stage'' reenacts a condensed version of the first two seasons of the show.<ref name=liveonstage>[http://cheersliveonstage.com/ ''Cheers Live On Stage''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918161014/http://cheersliveonstage.com/ |date=September 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOne episode of ''Cheers'' has a crossover reference to ''[[Spenser: For Hire]]'' (a Cheers bartender has a cameo appearance as an unspeaking extra).\n\nIn ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', [[Peter Quill]] makes numerous references to the show ''Cheers.''\n\nIn the [[The Good Place (season 2)|season 2 finale]] of the NBC sitcom ''[[The Good Place]]'', Ted Danson's character Michael appears as a bartender while wearing a blue plaid button-down, in a clear homage to Danson's character in ''Cheers''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/the-good-place-season-2-finale-ted-danson-cheers.html|title=The Good Place Finally Gave Ted Danson His Cheers Moment|last=Ivie|first=Devon|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', [[Dan Hedaya]]'s character Kamehl Butabi and his friends are listening to Emily ([[Molly Shannon]]) play the piano. She was playing the song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\" which is clearly a reference to Hedaya's past as [[Nick Tortelli]] on ''Cheers''.\n\nIn 2019 members of the ''Cheers'' cast, Rhea Perlman, George Wendt, John Ratzenberger and Kirstie Alley reprised their characters in an episode of [[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|''The Goldbergs'']] where they play customers of Geoff's short-lived food delivery business.\n\n==Remake==\nIn September 2011, Plural Entertainment debuted a remake of the series on [[Spain|Spanish]] television, also titled ''[[Cheers (Spanish TV series)|Cheers]]''. Set at an Irish pub, it starred [[Alberto San Juan]] as Nicol\u00e1s \"Nico\" Arnedo, the equivalent of Sam Malone in the original series. It also used the original theme song, rerecorded in Spanish by [[Dani Mart\u00edn]], under the title of \"[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name|D\u00f3nde la gente se divierte]].\"\n\nIn December 2012, The Irish Film and Television Network announced that casting was underway on an [[Irish-language]] version of ''Cheers'' produced by production company Sideline. The new show, tentatively titled ''Teach Se\u00e1n'', would air on Ireland's TG4 and features a main character who, like Sam Malone, is a bar owner, a retired athlete and a recovering alcoholic. However, because of being set in Ireland, the barman is a \"former [[hurling]] star\" rather than an ex-baseball player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2012/12/19/irish-cheers/|title= Irish TV channel to remake 'Cheers'|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> As of August 2019, the Irish remake has not occurred.\n\n==''Cheers: Live On Stage''==\nOn September 9, 2016, a stage adaptation called, ''Cheers: Live On Stage'', opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (Boston)|Shubert Theatre]] in Boston. Comprising pieces of the original TV series, the play was adapted by Erik Forrest Jackson. It was produced by Troika/Stageworks. The director was Matt Lenz. It starred Grayson Powell as Sam Malone, Jillian Louis as Diane Chambers, [[Barry Pearl]] as Ernie 'Coach' Pantusso, Sarah Sirotta as Carla Tortelli, Paul Vogt as Norm Peterson, and Buzz Roddy as Cliff Clavin.
