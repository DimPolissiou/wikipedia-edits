Its theme music, \"The Fuzz\" by [[Frank DeVol]], became one of the show's trademarks, together with the program logo and the \"Boa Noite\" (\"Good evening\") closing established by the hosts.

The programming schedule would later be adapted for regional affiliates with the addition of local news broadcasts on select hours. The process was led by Walter Clark and Jose Bonifacio de Olivera Sobrinho in 1960, when ''Rede Excelsior'' was launched (the process was inherited by ''Rede Globo'' upon Excelsior's closure in 1970). The network's audience share increased in the late 1970s, eventually clinching the top ratings spot of Brazil television. This was the reason Silvio Santos, one of the network's original variety show presenters since 1965, backed out of Globo, and moved his 11-year-old program (Programa Silvio Santos, ''The Silvio Santos Program'') to [[Rede Tupi]], while putting up his own network, TVS (now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]]) in the process the next year, even bringing his own show there. In the process, it would also continue the first nationwide variety show telecast that Globo had since 1966, and ten years later was also broadcast on S\u00e3o Paulo's [[RecordTV]] until 1987, on Rede Tupi until 1980, and on TVS, now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]], until the present day.\n\n[[File:Globo logo 1975.svg|150px|thumb|right|The ''Rede Globo'' logo used from 18 July 1975 until 2 September 1983]]\n''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' began the next year, continuing until 1995, together with the network's morning news program, ''Bom Dia S\u00e3o Paulo'' (Good Morning S\u00e3o Paulo), which four years later would have a national version. 1975 would also be the first time its present corporate logo was shown: it was created by Hans Donner, and was then a colored blue sphere with a TV-shaped box with another blue ball inside. Donner also created the network's first presentation package with the new corporate logo for the first time with the help of New York-based Dolphin Productions - making Globo the first national network to use the [[Scanimate]] system of computer animation and the second TV station in Brazil to adopt it after TVS in Rio de Janeiro, the first TV channel to use the system in 1976. That year also marked the premiere of ''[[S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (1977 TV series)|S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), one of the network's famous children's series. Its first version ran until 1986, its second version was aired from 2001 to 2007 (both were live-action ones) and from April 2007, it has an animated version as well but the 2000 logo version of ''Globo'' that they used turned out to be their last.\n\nThe network's second successful FIFA World Cup telecast after its first ([[FIFA World Cup 1978]]) happened the following year (1978), followed by the premiere telecast of ''Globo Esporte'' (''Globo Sports''), the network's daily sports newscast, still airing before ''Jornal Hoje'', then anchored by Luciano do Valle. That same year, ''Caso Especial'' ended its first phrase of broadcasts (it would continue until 1995, under various names), and was replaced by another teletheater program, ''Aplauso''. The decade closed with the premiere of the ''Domingo Maior'' (Best Sunday) film block, one of the new programs Globo made for Sundays, the ''Cinema Especial'' holiday film specials, and the revival of Jornal da Globo in 1979 after a ten-year absence (it lasted until 1981), plus the ''Jornal das Sete'' (News at Seven) local newscasts of 1979-83, precursor to the network's local news programs of today. ''Jornal da Globo'' was anchored by Sergio Chapelin at the time and aired after JN Second Edition, and now had a running time of 30 minutes. ''Domingo Global'', the musical program showcasting both Brazilian and international music, also made its debut.\n\n=== At the top: Globo in a changing era of Brazilian television (1980\u201390) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAs ''Rede Globo'' marked its 15th years of broadcasts in 1980\u201381, it had two major events in its sleeve. Since 1980 was the year that [[Rede Tupi]] shut down all of its operations, it surprised many former Tupi viewers and supporters with its anniversary programs. Two of them was the Festival 15 Anos (15th Years Festival) which showcased the best drama programs of the last 15 years, and the ''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' marathon, which gave itself to charitable activities for 8 long hours. It proved to many Brazilians how the network was proving well as the now audience leader in Brazilian television.\n\n''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'' (''It's Worth Watching Once Again''), an afternoon drama block, debuted on 5 May that year. ''Globo Rural'', its rural newscast also debuted in the same year, with Carlos Nascimento as its first presenter. By then, it was broadcast weekly, on Sundays. Another debut program was the woman-oriented ''TV Mulher''.\n\n==== More surprises and shows ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1981 saw the debut of the top-rating comedy program ''Viva O Gordo'' with J\u00f4 Soares at the helm, one of the network's many mainstay comedies of the decade. Aside from its [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] coverage in 1982, the network premiered the children's show ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' (''Magic Balloon''), which ran from 1982 to 1986. It was anchored by the children's musical group [[Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico]], whose music struck a chord with its viewers. 1982 saw the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch in August, after two successive editions. The presenters then were Renato Machado, Belisa Ribeiro and Luciana Villas Boas, with Carlos Monforte as program commentator.\n\n1983 saw the birth of another network hit: [[V\u00eddeo Show]], successfully airing until 2019. Its first program host was T\u00e1ssia Camargo. The network's daily electronic magazine show (formerly a weekly program from 1983\u201394), it gives an inside look of the network's programs and includes bloopers, interviews and even a look into Globo's historical moments. Bonner, Chico Pinheiro and Malu Mader were some of the program's early co-hosts. It had its SOS Nordeste (SOS Northeast) campaign which debuted that year led by Renato Arag\u00e3o of ''Os Trapalh\u00f5es'', lasting until 1986. Another success was the top-rating drama ''Guerra Dos Sexos'' in the evening slots.\n\nAlso debuting that year were the ''Pra\u00e7a TV'' local newscasts (the names of the program were different depending on the state or locality it was transmitted to; ''RJ TV'', ''SP TV'', ''MG TV'', ''ES TV'', ''DF TV'', ''BA TV'', ''Paran\u00e1 TV''), aired twice a day and the national version of the network's S\u00e3o Paulo morning newscast, ''Bom Dia Brasil'' (Good Morning Brazil), with Carlos Monforte as its first anchor, by then based in Globo's Bras\u00edlia studios until 1996. By then it had two editions, only broadcast in full then in Globo's Recife, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte stations because S\u00e3o Paulo (1977\u2013) and Rio de Janeiro (1983\u201384 and 1989\u2013) had their own local editions (Bom Dia Pra\u00e7a) of the newscast.\n\nIn 1984, it not only premiered its ''Supercine'' film slot (which is aired on Saturdays), it extended Pra\u00e7a TV to late night as a result of the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch of 1982. Lasting until 1990, the 10-minute ''Pra\u00e7a TV Terceira Edi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Pra\u00e7a TV Third Edition) gave its affiliated stations the chance to recap the day's local news in their own networks after ''Jornal da Globo'' was aired. By then, Eliakim Araujo and Liliana Rodriguez (later replaced by Leilane Neubarth in 1984) had become its presenters, and had J\u00f4 Soares as humorist until he moved to SBT in 1988. Also premiering was ''Pra\u00e7a TV Sunday Editions'', lasting until June 1987, which highlighted the news stories of the day and served as Fantastico's preview show in the midday and early evening editions. It was also the year of the [[Diretas J\u00e1]] (Direct Elections (for president) Now) campaign in some Brazilian cities from March 1983 to April 1984, in which ''Jornal Nacional'' had a mistake in carrying news about the campaign's progress.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== 1985\u201389: Globo at 20, countdown to 25 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1985 was Globo's 20th anniversary. It was one of the best years ever for the channel, for various reasons. One reason was the ''Festival 20 Anos'' (''20 Years Festival'') showcase of previous soap operas aired on the network. Other surprises include the record breaking final episode of ''[[Roque Santeiro]]'', then its rating-topping series, which in March, after a 10-year absence was finally shown on ''Rede Globo'' newer than its planned previous edition, and the debut of ''Coruj\u00e3o'', its programming-ending block of films for all Brazilians, especially the older citizens, now rejoiced by the end of the country's military rule of 21 years. Since it is the last program before sign-off except for some days of the week, films rated for adults are shown here, followed by the network's sign-off plug, showing the next day's programming. SOS Nordeste Urgente ended its run that year, and the network formally announced its replacement, the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' (''Children's Hope'') charity telethon, to be aired the next year.\n\nIn 1986, Editora Globo, the Globo publishing house, was established. It holds 10% of the Brazilian magazine market, Brazil\u2019s second largest [[publisher]] leading in several segments of the market.<ref>56.\tNeto, R. de G. (1997). Case Study: TV Globo--The Brazilian Media Giant.\u00a0International Executive,\u00a039(2), 255\u2013269.\u00a0\n</ref>\n\n1986 was the key year when [[Xuxa Meneghel]]'s own show, ''[[Xou da Xuxa]]'' (''Xuxa's Show'') debuted on Rede Globo. Xuxa, who left the similarly formatted program ''Clube da Crian\u00e7a'' on ''[[Rede Manchete]]'', joined the network and thus, her show replaced the successful ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' as a result. It was a hit among children in all the country, airing all week (from Mondays to Saturdays) for seven years until 1992. That year was also the 20th anniversary of Os Trapalh\u00f5es, which lasted until 1987. The network's other big program was its coverage of the [[1986 Copa Ouro]], plus the first telecast of the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' children's charity show, which Renato Arag\u00e3o (of Os Trapalh\u00f5es) hosted. The logo was renovated several times in the years that followed. 1987 saw yet more improved programming debut in all areas. In 1988, ''[[Vale Tudo (telenovela)|Vale Tudo]]'', one of Brazilian television's best dramas, premiered on the channel followed by its ''Tela Quente'' (''Hot Screen'') weekly film block, aired on Mondays.\n\nOn 26 March 1989, the network's own Sunday variety program, ''[[Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o]]'' (''Faust\u00e3o's Big-Sunday''), was launched as the network started to take over the Sunday afternoon TV ratings, then led by SBT's ''Programa Silvio Santos''. Still airing on Sunday afternoons and evenings before ''Fant\u00e1stico''. Another newcomer was the ''Sessao M\u00e1xima'' film block, airing on Sundays since 1990 (originally airing on Wednesdays). Within the year, so many series and programs premiered on the network and were aired until 1990, but the news programs got a makeover and change of presenters, especially the main newscasts and Pra\u00e7a TV in the local level.\n\nEven ''[[Jornal Nacional]]'' and ''[[Jornal da Globo]]'' got makeovers and hosting changes, the former got its present version of ''The Fuzz'' plus a new studio coupled with the return of Sergio Chapelin to the program as co-presenter, its then anchors, leaving behind co-anchor Leilane Neubarth. All three presenters were replaced by [[William Bonner (newscaster)|William Bonner]] and [[F\u00e1tima Bernardes]] (the latter had already replaced Cordeiro when she moved to ''Jornal Hoje''), becoming their first team-up in a Globo newscast since March that year, when Bernardes joined ''Fant\u00e1stico'' along with Fausto Silva, becoming one of its co-hosts along with Bonner, Chapelin and others plus Chico Anysio, one of the original presenters. Bonner soon took over as ''Jornal Hoje'' principal anchor (replacing Cordeiro) and joined ''Jornal Nacional'' as one of the substitute presenters while Fatima stayed with ''Fant\u00e1stico'' until the mid-1990s. They were to be married in 1993, several years after Eliakim and Leila's own wedding. The year ended with hope that next year, the 40th year of Brazilian TV and Globo's 25th anniversary year, will be one of the best years that Globo has ever seen, as shown in their years-end campaign video commemorating its 25th anniversary, in which most of the network's artists, program presenters and newscasters performed its 25th anniversary theme song. In 1990, Globo turned 25 years old. Some of its shows and programs debuted that same year, together with its anniversary presentation Festival 25 Anos (''25 Years Festival'') of replayed telecasts of all its best programs in the past 25 years were:\n\n* ''Escolinha do Professor Raimundo'' (weekday afternoons)\n* ''Araponga''\n* ''A Rainha da Sucata''\n\nTV Pirata ended its run that year, because of the loss of the post JN program slot ratings to [[Rede Manchete]]'s ''[[Pantanal]]'' drama series, then aired on weekdays from 9:30 to 10:30 in the evening, and was reinstated in 1991. It also broadcast the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] that same year, and covered the 1990 congressional elections for the National Congress of Brazil.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== 1991\u20131992: The countdown to 30 years and Globosat Networks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1991 saw the birth of ''Globosat'', the Globo Organization's own cable service, of which ''Rede Globo'' was but part. By then, it had only 4 channels, compared with more than 30 channels today. Another big surprise also came that year in the form of ''O Dono do Mundo'', another of its top record dramas, plus ''Vamp'', its highly successful 7 P.M. soap, which would later become a South American hit. Plant\u00e3o JN, Globo's own breaking news service was relaunched into ''Plant\u00e3o da Globo'' that year, and Fausto Silva began hosting his own New Year's program. Globo became the official network for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when it made its national premiere. Its 6:00 soap opera, ''Felicidade'', marked yet another first for the network because it had a woman director, Denise Saraceni, for the first time in national television drama history.\n\nBy the next year, President Collor's impeachment trials and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were all covered by Rede Globo's news and sports teams. {{clarify span|On 31 December 1992, Globo lost this franchise with a closing ceremony the programme closed and the Globo ident has Ended, the anthropomorphic puppet hosted show that continued the network's long successes with child-friendly programming.

It would be also a great year for its drama and news departments. However, May Day celebrations that year were marred by the sudden death that same day of the nation's [[Formula One]] hero, [[Ayrton Senna]], during the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]]. As the official F1 broadcaster, it brought the sad news of his demise to the nation and covered its aftermath with special coverages and the huge national mourning for his sudden loss.\n\n=== 1995\u20131999: Into the 21st century and the 5th century of Brazil ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2015}}\n''Globo'' turned 30 on 1 January 1995. The highlights of the year included the opening of the brand new [[Est\u00fadios Globo]] studios and the launch of a new youth oriented program: [[Malha\u00e7\u00e3o]], plus its Festival 30 Anos (30 Years Festival) commemorative series. It was the year that Os Trapalh\u00f5es ended a long successful run on the network, and the Plim Plim interval idents{{Clarify|date=July 2015}} were updated by various cartoonists for the anniversary. ''Globo'' suffered a year of audience losses but in 1996 audience share began to increase until they were the nation's number one network, aided by brand new programs (among them were the telenovela ''O Rei do Gado'' and the very popular sitcom ''Sai de Baixo'') and its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, coupled with changes in the newsrooms. ''Globo'' was the first Brazilian network to have its own news channel, ''[[Globo News]]'', which started in the same year. Now based in both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the latter the main headquarters, it broadcast replays of ''Globo'' news programs, and had its own news programs and commentaries. The network ratings were threatened by the top rated programming from SBT and Record, but in 1998 the network recovered its top place with its 1998 FIFA World Cup live coverage, although violent images became an issue when its 9 P.M. telenovela Torre de Babel was pulled off the air. Holiday programming was boosted by its New Year's Eve premiere of ''Show da Virada'', Aloysio Legey's creation and Brazil's response to international New Year television celebrations worldwide. That year was also the start of its ground breaking Brazil 500 project aimed at preparing the nation for its 500th anniversary of European discovery.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n''Globo'' has since expanded to become the largest TV Network in Brazil, with over $2 billion in revenue in 1992.<ref name=\"Helena Sousa\">{{Cite news|last=Sousa|first=Helena|title=The re-export of the US commercial television model|pages=1\u201315|publisher=Minho University|date=July 1998|url=http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/sousa-helena-globo-sic.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n=== 2000: Globo at the beginning of the New Millennium and the golden year of Brazilian Television ===\n2000, the 35th anniversary of Globo, the 50th of Brazilian Television and the 500th for Brazil, was highlighted by its ''TV Ano 50'' series honoring the first five decades of Brazilian television, and the Brazil 500 festival concert, the launch of three brand new variety shows (the Saturday afternoon hit Caldeir\u00e3o do Huck, the late weeknight Programa do J\u00f4 with Jo Soares and Altas Horas, with Serginho Groisman, aired on Sunday midnights), new dramas, and its 2000 Summer Olympics coverage, and was capped off by the Titanic two-part premiere in December as part of Cinema Especial (for the first time in Brazilian TV), another ratings record breaker.

Despite the rising tide of support for Record programs, part of the big triumphs in this anniversary year was the ''Ti Ti Ti'' remake, which was one of the year's top rating dramas (also the first HD soap to be produced and made in this format on the 7&nbsp;pm slot), the first 6&nbsp;pm drama made in HD, ''Araguaia'', and its JN no Ar project on Jornal Nacional, aiming to viewers nationwide with the newscasts visiting various Brazilian cities. 2011, the year ''Globo'' launched its present slogan, saw the historic ''O Clone'' rebroadcast on ''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'', the longest in the historic of that block and a ratings winner in its timeslot.

The programming schedule would later be adapted for regional affiliates with the addition of local news broadcasts on select hours. The process was led by Walter Clark and Jose Bonifacio de Olivera Sobrinho in 1960, when ''Rede Excelsior'' was launched (the process was inherited by ''Rede Globo'' upon Excelsior's closure in 1970). The network's audience share increased in the late 1970s, eventually clinching the top ratings spot of Brazil television. This was the reason Silvio Santos, one of the network's original variety show presenters since 1965, backed out of Globo, and moved his 11-year-old program (Programa Silvio Santos, ''The Silvio Santos Program'') to [[Rede Tupi]], while putting up his own network, TVS (now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]]) in the process the next year, even bringing his own show there. In the process, it would also continue the first nationwide variety show telecast that Globo had since 1966, and ten years later was also broadcast on S\u00e3o Paulo's [[RecordTV]] until 1987, on Rede Tupi until 1980, and on TVS, now [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o|SBT]], until the present day.\n\n[[File:Globo logo 1975.svg|150px|thumb|right|The ''Rede Globo'' logo used from 18 July 1975 until 2 September 1983]]\n''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' began the next year, continuing until 1995, together with the network's morning news program, ''Bom Dia S\u00e3o Paulo'' (Good Morning S\u00e3o Paulo), which four years later would have a national version. 1975 would also be the first time its present corporate logo was shown: it was created by Hans Donner, and was then a colored blue sphere with a TV-shaped box with another blue ball inside. Donner also created the network's first presentation package with the new corporate logo for the first time with the help of New York-based Dolphin Productions - making Globo the first national network to use the [[Scanimate]] system of computer animation and the second TV station in Brazil to adopt it after TVS in Rio de Janeiro, the first TV channel to use the system in 1976. That year also marked the premiere of ''[[S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo (1977 TV series)|S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo]]'' (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), one of the network's famous children's series. Its first version ran until 1986, its second version was aired from 2001 to 2007 (both were live-action ones) and from April 2007, it has an animated version as well but the 2000 logo version of ''Globo'' that they used turned out to be their last.\n\nThe network's second successful FIFA World Cup telecast after its first ([[FIFA World Cup 1978]]) happened the following year (1978), followed by the premiere telecast of ''Globo Esporte'' (''Globo Sports''), the network's daily sports newscast, still airing before ''Jornal Hoje'', then anchored by Luciano do Valle. That same year, ''Caso Especial'' ended its first phrase of broadcasts (it would continue until 1995, under various names), and was replaced by another teletheater program, ''Aplauso''. The decade closed with the premiere of the ''Domingo Maior'' (Best Sunday) film block, one of the new programs Globo made for Sundays, the ''Cinema Especial'' holiday film specials, and the revival of Jornal da Globo in 1979 after a ten-year absence (it lasted until 1981), plus the ''Jornal das Sete'' (News at Seven) local newscasts of 1979-83, precursor to the network's local news programs of today. ''Jornal da Globo'' was anchored by Sergio Chapelin at the time and aired after JN Second Edition, and now had a running time of 30 minutes. ''Domingo Global'', the musical program showcasting both Brazilian and international music, also made its debut.\n\n=== At the top: Globo in a changing era of Brazilian television (1980\u201390) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAs ''Rede Globo'' marked its 15th years of broadcasts in 1980\u201381, it had two major events in its sleeve. Since 1980 was the year that [[Rede Tupi]] shut down all of its operations, it surprised many former Tupi viewers and supporters with its anniversary programs. Two of them was the Festival 15 Anos (15th Years Festival) which showcased the best drama programs of the last 15 years, and the ''[[Os Trapalh\u00f5es]]'' marathon, which gave itself to charitable activities for 8 long hours. It proved to many Brazilians how the network was proving well as the now audience leader in Brazilian television.\n\n''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'' (''It's Worth Watching Once Again''), an afternoon drama block, debuted on 5 May that year. ''Globo Rural'', its rural newscast also debuted in the same year, with Carlos Nascimento as its first presenter. By then, it was broadcast weekly, on Sundays. Another debut program was the woman-oriented ''TV Mulher''.\n\n==== More surprises and shows ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1981 saw the debut of the top-rating comedy program ''Viva O Gordo'' with J\u00f4 Soares at the helm, one of the network's many mainstay comedies of the decade. Aside from its [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] coverage in 1982, the network premiered the children's show ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' (''Magic Balloon''), which ran from 1982 to 1986. It was anchored by the children's musical group [[Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico]], whose music struck a chord with its viewers. 1982 saw the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch in August, after two successive editions. The presenters then were Renato Machado, Belisa Ribeiro and Luciana Villas Boas, with Carlos Monforte as program commentator.\n\n1983 saw the birth of another network hit: [[V\u00eddeo Show]], successfully airing until 2019. Its first program host was T\u00e1ssia Camargo. The network's daily electronic magazine show (formerly a weekly program from 1983\u201394), it gives an inside look of the network's programs and includes bloopers, interviews and even a look into Globo's historical moments. Bonner, Chico Pinheiro and Malu Mader were some of the program's early co-hosts. It had its SOS Nordeste (SOS Northeast) campaign which debuted that year led by Renato Arag\u00e3o of ''Os Trapalh\u00f5es'', lasting until 1986. Another success was the top-rating drama ''Guerra Dos Sexos'' in the evening slots.\n\nAlso debuting that year were the ''Pra\u00e7a TV'' local newscasts (the names of the program were different depending on the state or locality it was transmitted to; ''RJ TV'', ''SP TV'', ''MG TV'', ''ES TV'', ''DF TV'', ''BA TV'', ''Paran\u00e1 TV''), aired twice a day and the national version of the network's S\u00e3o Paulo morning newscast, ''Bom Dia Brasil'' (Good Morning Brazil), with Carlos Monforte as its first anchor, by then based in Globo's Bras\u00edlia studios until 1996. By then it had two editions, only broadcast in full then in Globo's Recife, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte stations because S\u00e3o Paulo (1977\u2013) and Rio de Janeiro (1983\u201384 and 1989\u2013) had their own local editions (Bom Dia Pra\u00e7a) of the newscast.\n\nIn 1984, it not only premiered its ''Supercine'' film slot (which is aired on Saturdays), it extended Pra\u00e7a TV to late night as a result of the ''Jornal da Globo'' relaunch of 1982. Lasting until 1990, the 10-minute ''Pra\u00e7a TV Terceira Edi\u00e7\u00e3o'' (Pra\u00e7a TV Third Edition) gave its affiliated stations the chance to recap the day's local news in their own networks after ''Jornal da Globo'' was aired. By then, Eliakim Araujo and Liliana Rodriguez (later replaced by Leilane Neubarth in 1984) had become its presenters, and had J\u00f4 Soares as humorist until he moved to SBT in 1988. Also premiering was ''Pra\u00e7a TV Sunday Editions'', lasting until June 1987, which highlighted the news stories of the day and served as Fantastico's preview show in the midday and early evening editions. It was also the year of the [[Diretas J\u00e1]] (Direct Elections (for president) Now) campaign in some Brazilian cities from March 1983 to April 1984, in which ''Jornal Nacional'' had a mistake in carrying news about the campaign's progress.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== 1985\u201389: Globo at 20, countdown to 25 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1985 was Globo's 20th anniversary. It was one of the best years ever for the channel, for various reasons. One reason was the ''Festival 20 Anos'' (''20 Years Festival'') showcase of previous soap operas aired on the network. Other surprises include the record breaking final episode of ''[[Roque Santeiro]]'', then its rating-topping series, which in March, after a 10-year absence was finally shown on ''Rede Globo'' newer than its planned previous edition, and the debut of ''Coruj\u00e3o'', its programming-ending block of films for all Brazilians, especially the older citizens, now rejoiced by the end of the country's military rule of 21 years. Since it is the last program before sign-off except for some days of the week, films rated for adults are shown here, followed by the network's sign-off plug, showing the next day's programming. SOS Nordeste Urgente ended its run that year, and the network formally announced its replacement, the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' (''Children's Hope'') charity telethon, to be aired the next year.\n\nIn 1986, Editora Globo, the Globo publishing house, was established. It holds 10% of the Brazilian magazine market, Brazil\u2019s second largest [[publisher]] leading in several segments of the market.<ref>56.\tNeto, R. de G. (1997). Case Study: TV Globo--The Brazilian Media Giant.\u00a0International Executive,\u00a039(2), 255\u2013269.\u00a0\n</ref>\n\n1986 was the key year when [[Xuxa Meneghel]]'s own show, ''[[Xou da Xuxa]]'' (''Xuxa's Show'') debuted on Rede Globo. Xuxa, who left the similarly formatted program ''Clube da Crian\u00e7a'' on ''[[Rede Manchete]]'', joined the network and thus, her show replaced the successful ''Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico'' as a result. It was a hit among children in all the country, airing all week (from Mondays to Saturdays) for seven years until 1992. That year was also the 20th anniversary of Os Trapalh\u00f5es, which lasted until 1987. The network's other big program was its coverage of the [[1986 Copa Ouro]], plus the first telecast of the ''Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a'' children's charity show, which Renato Arag\u00e3o (of Os Trapalh\u00f5es) hosted. The logo was renovated several times in the years that followed. 1987 saw yet more improved programming debut in all areas. In 1988, ''[[Vale Tudo (telenovela)|Vale Tudo]]'', one of Brazilian television's best dramas, premiered on the channel followed by its ''Tela Quente'' (''Hot Screen'') weekly film block, aired on Mondays.\n\nOn 26 March 1989, the network's own Sunday variety program, ''[[Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o]]'' (''Faust\u00e3o's Big-Sunday''), was launched as the network started to take over the Sunday afternoon TV ratings, then led by SBT's ''Programa Silvio Santos''. Still airing on Sunday afternoons and evenings before ''Fant\u00e1stico''. Another newcomer was the ''Sessao M\u00e1xima'' film block, airing on Sundays since 1990 (originally airing on Wednesdays). Within the year, so many series and programs premiered on the network and were aired until 1990, but the news programs got a makeover and change of presenters, especially the main newscasts and Pra\u00e7a TV in the local level.\n\nEven ''[[Jornal Nacional]]'' and ''[[Jornal da Globo]]'' got makeovers and hosting changes, the former got its present version of ''The Fuzz'' plus a new studio coupled with the return of Sergio Chapelin to the program as co-presenter, its then anchors, leaving behind co-anchor Leilane Neubarth. All three presenters were replaced by [[William Bonner (newscaster)|William Bonner]] and [[F\u00e1tima Bernardes]] (the latter had already replaced Cordeiro when she moved to ''Jornal Hoje''), becoming their first team-up in a Globo newscast since March that year, when Bernardes joined ''Fant\u00e1stico'' along with Fausto Silva, becoming one of its co-hosts along with Bonner, Chapelin and others plus Chico Anysio, one of the original presenters. Bonner soon took over as ''Jornal Hoje'' principal anchor (replacing Cordeiro) and joined ''Jornal Nacional'' as one of the substitute presenters while Fatima stayed with ''Fant\u00e1stico'' until the mid-1990s. They were to be married in 1993, several years after Eliakim and Leila's own wedding. The year ended with hope that next year, the 40th year of Brazilian TV and Globo's 25th anniversary year, will be one of the best years that Globo has ever seen, as shown in their years-end campaign video commemorating its 25th anniversary, in which most of the network's artists, program presenters and newscasters performed its 25th anniversary theme song. In 1990, Globo turned 25 years old. Some of its shows and programs debuted that same year, together with its anniversary presentation Festival 25 Anos (''25 Years Festival'') of replayed telecasts of all its best programs in the past 25 years were:\n\n* ''Escolinha do Professor Raimundo'' (weekday afternoons)\n* ''Araponga''\n* ''A Rainha da Sucata''\n\nTV Pirata ended its run that year, because of the loss of the post JN program slot ratings to [[Rede Manchete]]'s ''[[Pantanal]]'' drama series, then aired on weekdays from 9:30 to 10:30 in the evening, and was reinstated in 1991. It also broadcast the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] that same year, and covered the 1990 congressional elections for the National Congress of Brazil.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== 1991\u20131992: The countdown to 30 years and Globosat Networks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n1991 saw the birth of ''Globosat'', the Globo Organization's own cable service, of which ''Rede Globo'' was but part. By then, it had only 4 channels, compared with more than 30 channels today. Another big surprise also came that year in the form of ''O Dono do Mundo'', another of its top record dramas, plus ''Vamp'', its highly successful 7 P.M. soap, which would later become a South American hit. Plant\u00e3o JN, Globo's own breaking news service was relaunched into ''Plant\u00e3o da Globo'' that year, and Fausto Silva began hosting his own New Year's program. Globo became the official network for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when it made its national premiere. Its 6:00 soap opera, ''Felicidade'', marked yet another first for the network because it had a woman director, Denise Saraceni, for the first time in national television drama history.\n\nBy the next year, President Collor's impeachment trials and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were all covered by Rede Globo's news and sports teams. {{clarify span|On 31 December 1992, Globo lost this franchise with a closing ceremony the programme closed and the Globo ident has Ended, the anthropomorphic puppet hosted show that continued the network's long successes with child-friendly programming.

''Globo'' suffered a year of audience losses but in 1996 audience share began to increase until they were the nation's number one network, aided by brand new programs (among them were the telenovela ''O Rei do Gado'' and the very popular sitcom ''Sai de Baixo'') and its coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, coupled with changes in the newsrooms. ''Globo'' was the first Brazilian network to have its own news channel, ''[[Globo News]]'', which started in the same year. Now based in both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the latter the main headquarters, it broadcast replays of ''Globo'' news programs, and had its own news programs and commentaries. The network ratings were threatened by the top rated programming from SBT and Record, but in 1998 the network recovered its top place with its 1998 FIFA World Cup live coverage, although violent images became an issue when its 9 P.M. telenovela Torre de Babel was pulled off the air. Holiday programming was boosted by its New Year's Eve premiere of ''Show da Virada'', Aloysio Legey's creation and Brazil's response to international New Year television celebrations worldwide.

According to [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] (2010), China has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning, especially [[the English language]].\n\n==History==\n\n==='''''<sup><big><span lang=\"or\" dir=\"rtl\">Ancient to medieval period</span></big></sup>'''''===\nThe need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself. In the Ancient Near East, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the language of diplomacy, as in the [[Amarna letters]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scoville |first1=Priscila |title=Amarna Letters |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 November 2018}}</ref> For many centuries, [[Latin]] was the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of Europe, but it was displaced for many purposes by French, Italian, and English by the end of the 16th century. [[John Amos Comenius]] was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He wrote a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his ''Opera Didactica Omnia'', 1657.\n\nIn this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of [[language acquisition]]. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, or else pictures of them. He published the world's first illustrated children's book, ''[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]''. The study of Latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum. This decline demanded a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.\n\n\"Grammar schools\" from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.<ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |isbn=0-521-00843-3 }}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\nThe study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the [[grammar translation|grammar-translation method]].<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Sweet Henry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Henry Sweet]] was a key figure in establishing the [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching]]\nInnovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manes ca, [[Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff]] (1803\u20131865), [[Henry Sweet]] (1845\u20131912), [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860\u20131943), and [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]] (1877\u20131949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\nThe history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who have a foreign language as a major attain \"minimum professional proficiency\". Even the \"reading knowledge\" required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English. Even a number of famous linguists are monolingual.<ref name=\"Diller\">{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |url=https://archive.org/details/languageteaching0000dill |url-access=registration |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0-912066-22-9 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs. This tends to make the research of [[second language acquisition]] emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the [[grammar translation method]] and the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] are dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.\n\nMost books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past, often ending with the author's new method. These new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author's mind, as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method. For example, descriptive linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the [[audio-lingual method]] developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary. It is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely, though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g. the [[Maximilian Berlitz|Berlitz]] version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.<ref name=\"Diller\"/>(p.&nbsp;5)\n\nThere have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and theoretical, and these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another. Examples of researchers on the empiricist side are Jesperson, Palmer, and [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who promote mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species.\n\nOn the theoretical side are, for example, Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and [[Emile B. De Sauz\u00e9]], whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. These have led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin's \"series method\" to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauz\u00e9. With these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. This follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species. Given that human languages share many common traits, the idea is that humans share a [[universal grammar]] which is built into our brain structure. This allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.<ref name=\"Diller\"/>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nOver time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/21stCenturySkillsMap/p21_worldlanguagesmap.pdf|title=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages|website=www.actfl.org|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to [[Languages Other Than English|LOTE]] or Language Other Than English. In the majority of English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English As A Second Language is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.\n\n==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==\n{{main|Methods of teaching foreign languages}}\n\n[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]\nLanguage education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized '''[[language school]]'''. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.\n\nWhile sometimes confused, the terms \"approach\", \"method\" and \"technique\" are hierarchical concepts.\n\nAn '''approach''' is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning, but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting. Such can be related to [[second language acquisition theory]].\n\nThere are three principal \"approaches\":\n# The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).\n# The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.\n# The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\nA '''method''' is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned, and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.\n# Examples of structural methods are [[grammar translation]] and the [[audio-lingual method]].\n# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.\n# Examples of interactive methods include the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the series method, [[communicative language teaching]], [[language immersion]], the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], the [[Natural Approach]], [[Tandem language learning|Tandem Language Learning]], [[Total Physical Response]], [[Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling]] and [[Dogme language teaching]].\n\nA '''technique''' (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\n==Online and self-study courses==\nHundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Self-Study Courses: Comparison, Problems, Ratings|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.\n\n===Audio recordings and books===\nAudio '''recordings''' use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Accents|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209044721/http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2013|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shadowing Step by Step|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24|work=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAudio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs and websites.\n\nMost audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner's own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language.<ref>''Amazing Hear-Say'', by Donald Rivera, Penton Overseas Inc., {{ISBN|1-56015-677-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-350-0}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-353-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-349-7}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-351-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://aaa.Lang1234.com | title=Lessons for Beginners in English, mp3 | date=15 August 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.\n\nLanguage '''books''' have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hhh.Lang1234.com | title=Workers and Guests Have Different Language Needs in a Hotel | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.\n\nAlso, various other \"language learning tools\" have been entering the market in recent years.\n\n===Internet and software===\n'''Software''' can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:\n\n# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209054038/http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2013|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.\n# Software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures<ref>{{cite web|title=Language Guide|url=http://Languageguide.org|publisher=Language Guide|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.\n\n'''Websites''' provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:\n\n# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.\n# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.\n# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.\n# [[Language exchange]] sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat ''knowledge of a language'' as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, 'Language Perfect' \u2013 an online vocabulary learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students' progress as students gain a \"point\" for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Language Perfect contest held in May.\n\nMany other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained and marketed for other purposes:\n\n# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study conducted by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.<ref>{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching in Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>\n# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/ | title=Google Translate | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator | title=Bing Translator | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\n# [[Speech synthesis]] or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.\n# Course development and [[learning management system]]s such as [[Moodle]] are used by teachers, including language teachers.\n# [[Web conferencing]] tools can bring remote learners together; e.g. [[Elluminate Live]].\n# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual worlds]]. In 2005, the virtual world [[Second Life]] started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Study and teach in Second Life |url=http://www.its-teachers.com/destinations/second_life/second_life03.asp |work=iT's Magazines |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Apprendre une langue dans un monde virtuel |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-935560,0.html |work=Le Monde |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}</ref> In addition, Spain's language and cultural institute [[Instituto Cervantes]] has an \"island\" on Second Life.\nSome Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as [[Bbc Online#Knowledge and Learning|BBC Online]], Book2, [[Foreign Service Institute]], with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.\n\n==Learning strategies==\n[[Language learning strategies]] have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.\n\n===Listening as a way of learning===\nClearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners employ it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/improving-listening-skills/ focused listening]</ref> is not something that most learners employ as a strategy.\n\n===Reading as a way to learn===\nMany people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed.<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/learning-grammar/ strategy of reading]</ref>\n\n===Learning vocabulary===\n\nTranslation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been employed traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. [http://www.duolingo.com DuoLingo], [http://www.LingoMonkey.com LingoMonkey] and [http://www.vocabularystickers.com Vocabulary Stickers]). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/how-to-remember-vocabulary/ How to remember vocabulary]</ref>\n\n=== Learning Esperanto ===\n{{Main|Esperanto}}\n\nEsperanto, the most widely used international auxiliary language, is founded by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist, in 1887, aimed to eliminate language barriers in the international contacts. Esperanto is an artificial language created on the basis of the [[Indo-European languages]], absorbing the reasonable factors of commonality of the [[Germanic languages]]. Esperanto is completely consistent in its speech and writing. The stress of every word is fixed on the penultimate syllable. By learning twenty-eight letters and mastering the phonetic rules, one can read and write any words. With further simplification and standardization, Esperanto becomes more easily to master than other languages. Ease of learning help one build the confidence and learning Esperanto, as a learning strategy, constitutes a good introduction to foreign language study.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charters|first=Duncan|date=2015|title=The Teaching and Learning of Esperanto|journal=Interdisciplinary Description of Complex Systems|volume=13|issue=2|pages=288\u2013298|doi=10.7906/indecs.13.2.7|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Teaching strategies==\n\n===Blended learning===\n{{Main|Blended learning}}\nBlended learning combines face-to-face teaching with [[distance education]], frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. {{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nSome people, though, use the phrase 'Blended Learning' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).\n\n===Skill teaching===\nWhen talking about language skills, the four basic ones are: listening, speaking, reading and writing. However, other, more socially based skills have been identified more recently such as summarizing, describing, narrating etc. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms.<ref name=\"Holden\">{{cite book |title=English language teaching |last=Holden |first=Susan |author2=Mickey Rodgers  |year=1998 |publisher=DELTI |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-6820-12-4 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. However, since then, it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises.<ref name=\"Holden\"/> Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.\n\nMore recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.<ref name=\"Holden\"/>\n\n===Sandwich technique===\n{{main|Sandwich technique}}\nIn [[second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]], the '''sandwich technique''' is the oral insertion of an [[idiom|idiomatic translation]] in the [[mother tongue]] between an unknown phrase in the [[second language|learned language]] and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.\n\nWhen modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 => L1 => L2. For example, a [[German language|German]] teacher of [[English language|English]] might engage in the following exchange with the students:\n\n: Teacher: \"Let me try \u2013 lass mich versuchen \u2013 let me try.\"\n: Students: \"Let me try.\"\n\n===Mother tongue mirroring===\n{{main|Mother tongue mirroring}}\nMother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honoured technique of [[literal translation]] or word-for word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and, in many cases, spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from [[literal translation]] and [[interlinear text]] as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. This technique is seldom referred to or used these days.\n\n===Back-chaining===\n{{main|Back-chaining}}\nBack-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with [[polysyllabic]] or difficult words.<ref name=\"ue\">\"Backchaining.\" ''Glossary.'' Retrieved 4 April 2009, from http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/backchaining.html</ref> The teacher pronounces the last syllable, the student repeats, and then the teacher continues, working backwards from the end of the word to the beginning.<ref>\"Backchaining.\" ''Teaching English.'' Retrieved 4 April 2009, from http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/backchaining</ref>\n\nFor example, to teach the name \u2018[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]' a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: ''-sky,'' and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with ''-sorg-'' attached before: ''-sorg-sky,'' and all that remains is the first syllable: ''Mus-sorg-sky.''\n\n=== Code Switching ===\n{{Main|Code-switching|l1=Code switching}}\n\nCode switching is a special linguistic phenomenon that the speaker consciously alternates two or more languages according to different time, places, contents, objects and other factors. Code switching shows its functions while one is in the environment that mother tongue are not playing a dominant role in students' life and study, such as the children in the bilingual family or in the immigrant family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Juyoung|first=Song|date=March 2019|title=Language Socialization and Code-Switching: A Case Study of a Korean-English Bilingual Child in a Korean Transnational Family|journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education & Bilingualism|volume=22|issue=2|pages=91\u2013106|doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1231165}}</ref> That is to say, the capability of using code switching, relating to the transformation of phonetics, words, language structure, expression mode, thinking mode, cultural differences and so on, is needed to be guided and developed in the daily communication environment. Most people learn foreign language in the circumstance filled with the using of their native language so that their ability of code switching cannot be stimulated, and thus the efficiency of foreign language acquisition would decrease. Therefore, as a teaching strategy, code switching is used to help students better gain conceptual competences and to provide rich semantic context for them to understand some specific vocabularies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cahyani|first=Hilda|last2=de Courcy|first2=Michele|last3=Barnett|first3=Jenny|date=May 2018|title=Teachers' Code-Switching in Bilingual Classrooms: Exploring Pedagogical and Sociocultural Functions|journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education & Bilingualism|volume=21|issue=4|pages=465\u2013479|doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1189509}}</ref>\n\n==By region==\n{{main|Language education by region}}\n\nPractices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorisation and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]], in [[Asia]] or in [[Australia]].\n\n== By different life stage ==\n\n=== Early childhood education ===\n{{Main|Early childhood education|l1=Early Childhood Education}}\n\nEarly childhood is the fastest and most critical period for one to master language in their life. Children's language communication is transformed from non-verbal communication to verbal communication from ages of one to five. Their mastery of language is largely acquired naturally by living in a verbal communication environment. As long as we are good at guiding and creating opportunities for children, children's language ability is easy to be developed and cultivated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Linda|date=March 2004|title=Preschoolers Study Foreign Tongues|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=12835748&site=ehost-live.|journal=Education Week|volume=23|pages=1\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=McEntire|first=Nancy|date=March 2004|title=ECAP Report: Working With Preschool Children Who Are English Language Learners|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=12835748&site=ehost-live|journal=Childhood Education|volume=23|pages=172\u2013173}}</ref>\n\n=== Compulsory education ===\nCompulsory education, for most people, is the period that they have access to a second or foreign language for the first time. In this period, the most professional foreign language education and academic atmosphere are provided to the students. They can get help and motivation from teachers and be activated by the peers at any time. One would be able to undergo a lot of specialized learning in order to truly master a great number of rules of vocabulary, grammar and verbal communication.\n\n=== Adult education ===\n{{See also|Adult education|l1=Adult Education}}\n\nLearning a foreign language during adulthood means one is pursuing a higher value of himself by obtaining a new skill. At this stage, individuals have already developed study habit so that they own sufficient self-restrict ability to supervise themselves learning a language. However, at the same time, the pressure is also an obstacle for adults.\n\n=== Elderly education ===\nCompared to other life stage, this period is the hardest one to learning a new language because of the gradually brain deterioration and memory-loss. Meanwhile, language education for seniors can slow down the degeneration of brain and active ageing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schunova|first=Romana|date=2018|title=LANGUAGE EDUCATION OF SENIORS AS A TOOL OF ACTIVE AGEING|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=134101976&site=ehost-live|journal=Ad Alta: Journal of Interdisciplinary Research.|volume=8|pages=233\u2013238}}</ref>\n\n==Language study holidays==\n{{See also|Language school}}\nAn increasing number of people are now combining [[tourism|holiday]]s with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a [[homestay]], perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta & UK being the most popular because almost everyone speaks English as a first language) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and [[ACUPARI|Peru]]. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/travel-agents-missing-profitable-language-travel-holidays-sprachcaffe/ |title=Travel agents missing out on profitable language travel holidays \u2013 Sprachcaffe |publisher=TravelWeek|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=29 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWith the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one's disposal.

Common languages are used in areas such as trade, tourism, international relations, technology, media, and science. Many countries such as [[Korea]] (Kim Yeong-seo, 2009), [[Japan]] (Kubota, 1998) and [[China]] (Kirkpatrick & Zhichang, 2002) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels. However, some countries such as [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], and the [[Philippines]] use a second official language in their governments. According to [[Government Accountability Office|GAO]] (2010), China has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning, especially [[the English language]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient to medieval period===\nThe need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself. In the Ancient Near East, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] was the language of diplomacy, as in the [[Amarna letters]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scoville |first1=Priscila |title=Amarna Letters |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Amarna_Letters/ |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 November 2018}}</ref> For many centuries, [[Latin]] was the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of Europe, but it was displaced for many purposes by French, Italian, and English by the end of the 16th century. [[John Amos Comenius]] was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He wrote a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his ''Opera Didactica Omnia'', 1657.\n\nIn this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of [[language acquisition]]. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, or else pictures of them. He published the world's first illustrated children's book, ''[[Orbis sensualium pictus]]''. The study of Latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum. This decline demanded a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.\n\n\"Grammar schools\" from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.<ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |isbn=0-521-00843-3 }}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\nThe study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the [[grammar translation|grammar-translation method]].<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Sweet Henry.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Henry Sweet]] was a key figure in establishing the [[applied linguistics]] tradition in language teaching]]\nInnovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manes ca, [[Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff]] (1803\u20131865), [[Henry Sweet]] (1845\u20131912), [[Otto Jespersen]] (1860\u20131943), and [[Harold E. Palmer|Harold Palmer]] (1877\u20131949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\nThe history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who have a foreign language as a major attain \"minimum professional proficiency\". Even the \"reading knowledge\" required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English. Even a number of famous linguists are monolingual.<ref name=\"Diller\">{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |url=https://archive.org/details/languageteaching0000dill |url-access=registration |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0-912066-22-9 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs. This tends to make the research of [[second language acquisition]] emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the [[grammar translation method]] and the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] are dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.\n\nMost books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past, often ending with the author's new method. These new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author's mind, as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method. For example, descriptive linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the [[audio-lingual method]] developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary. It is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely, though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g. the [[Maximilian Berlitz|Berlitz]] version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.<ref name=\"Diller\"/>(p.&nbsp;5)\n\nThere have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and theoretical, and these have almost completely separate histories, with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another. Examples of researchers on the empiricist side are Jesperson, Palmer, and [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who promote mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species.\n\nOn the theoretical side are, for example, Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and [[Emile B. De Sauz\u00e9]], whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by [[Noam Chomsky]] and others. These have led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin's \"series method\" to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauz\u00e9. With these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. This follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species. Given that human languages share many common traits, the idea is that humans share a [[universal grammar]] which is built into our brain structure. This allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.<ref name=\"Diller\"/>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nOver time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/21stCenturySkillsMap/p21_worldlanguagesmap.pdf|title=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages|website=www.actfl.org|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to [[Languages Other Than English|LOTE]] or Language Other Than English. In the majority of English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English As A Second Language is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.\n\n==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==\n{{main|Methods of teaching foreign languages}}\n\n[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]\nLanguage education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized '''[[language school]]'''. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.\n\nWhile sometimes confused, the terms \"approach\", \"method\" and \"technique\" are hierarchical concepts.\n\nAn '''approach''' is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning, but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting. Such can be related to [[second language acquisition theory]].\n\nThere are three principal \"approaches\":\n# The structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).\n# The functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.\n# The interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\nA '''method''' is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned, and should be based upon a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.\n# Examples of structural methods are [[grammar translation]] and the [[audio-lingual method]].\n# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.\n# Examples of interactive methods include the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the series method, [[communicative language teaching]], [[language immersion]], the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], the [[Natural Approach]], [[Tandem language learning|Tandem Language Learning]], [[Total Physical Response]], [[Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling]] and [[Dogme language teaching]].\n\nA '''technique''' (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.<ref name=\"Richards\"/>\n\n==Online and self-study courses==\nHundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Self-Study Courses: Comparison, Problems, Ratings|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.\n\n===Audio recordings and books===\nAudio '''recordings''' use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Good Accents|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209044721/http://lastly.weebly.com/2/category/accent/1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2013|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shadowing Step by Step|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130bOvRpt24|work=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAudio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs and websites.\n\nMost audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner's own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language.<ref>''Amazing Hear-Say'', by Donald Rivera, Penton Overseas Inc., {{ISBN|1-56015-677-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-350-0}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-353-5}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-349-7}}, {{ISBN|1-59125-351-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://aaa.Lang1234.com | title=Lessons for Beginners in English, mp3 | date=15 August 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.\n\nLanguage '''books''' have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hhh.Lang1234.com | title=Workers and Guests Have Different Language Needs in a Hotel | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.\n\nAlso, various other \"language learning tools\" have been entering the market in recent years.\n\n===Internet and software===\n'''Software''' can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:\n\n# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|url=http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209054038/http://lastly.weebly.com/3/post/2012/08/pronunciation.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2013|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.\n# Software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures<ref>{{cite web|title=Language Guide|url=http://Languageguide.org|publisher=Language Guide|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner's native language.\n\n'''Websites''' provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:\n\n# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.\n# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.\n# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.\n# [[Language exchange]] sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat ''knowledge of a language'' as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at [[language school]]s. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, 'Language Perfect' \u2013 an online vocabulary learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students' progress as students gain a \"point\" for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Language Perfect contest held in May.\n\nMany other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained and marketed for other purposes:\n\n# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study conducted by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.<ref>{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching in Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>\n# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/ | title=Google Translate | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator | title=Bing Translator | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>\n# [[Speech synthesis]] or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.\n# Course development and [[learning management system]]s such as [[Moodle]] are used by teachers, including language teachers.\n# [[Web conferencing]] tools can bring remote learners together; e.g. [[Elluminate Live]].\n# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual worlds]]. In 2005, the virtual world [[Second Life]] started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Study and teach in Second Life |url=http://www.its-teachers.com/destinations/second_life/second_life03.asp |work=iT's Magazines |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Xavier |last=Dorveaux |title=Apprendre une langue dans un monde virtuel |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0,36-935560,0.html |work=Le Monde |date=15 July 2007 |accessdate= 15 July 2007 }}</ref> In addition, Spain's language and cultural institute [[Instituto Cervantes]] has an \"island\" on Second Life.\nSome Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as [[Bbc Online#Knowledge and Learning|BBC Online]], Book2, [[Foreign Service Institute]], with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.\n\n==Learning strategies==\n[[Language learning strategies]] have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.\n\n===Listening as a way of learning===\nClearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners employ it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/improving-listening-skills/ focused listening]</ref> is not something that most learners employ as a strategy.\n\n===Reading as a way to learn===\nMany people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed.<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/learning-grammar/ strategy of reading]</ref>\n\n===Learning vocabulary===\n\nTranslation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been employed traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. [http://www.duolingo.com DuoLingo], [http://www.LingoMonkey.com LingoMonkey] and [http://www.vocabularystickers.com Vocabulary Stickers]). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.<ref>Andrew Weiler: [http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/how-to-remember-vocabulary/ How to remember vocabulary]</ref>\n\n=== Learning Esperanto ===\n{{Main|Esperanto}}\n\nEsperanto, the most widely used international auxiliary language, is founded by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist, in 1887, aimed to eliminate language barriers in the international contacts. Esperanto is an artificial language created on the basis of the [[Indo-European languages]], absorbing the reasonable factors of commonality of the [[Germanic languages]]. Esperanto is completely consistent in its speech and writing. The stress of every word is fixed on the penultimate syllable. By learning twenty-eight letters and mastering the phonetic rules, one can read and write any words. With further simplification and standardization, Esperanto becomes more easily to master than other languages. Ease of learning help one build the confidence and learning Esperanto, as a learning strategy, constitutes a good introduction to foreign language study.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Charters|first=Duncan|date=2015|title=The Teaching and Learning of Esperanto|journal=Interdisciplinary Description of Complex Systems|volume=13|issue=2|pages=288\u2013298|doi=10.7906/indecs.13.2.7|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Teaching strategies==\n\n===Blended learning===\n{{Main|Blended learning}}\nBlended learning combines face-to-face teaching with [[distance education]], frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. {{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nSome people, though, use the phrase 'Blended Learning' to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).\n\n===Skill teaching===\nWhen talking about language skills, the four basic ones are: listening, speaking, reading and writing. However, other, more socially based skills have been identified more recently such as summarizing, describing, narrating etc. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms.<ref name=\"Holden\">{{cite book |title=English language teaching |last=Holden |first=Susan |author2=Mickey Rodgers  |year=1998 |publisher=DELTI |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-6820-12-4 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. However, since then, it has been recognized that we generally use more than one skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises.<ref name=\"Holden\"/> Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.\n\nMore recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.<ref name=\"Holden\"/>\n\n===Sandwich technique===\n{{main|Sandwich technique}}\nIn [[second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]], the '''sandwich technique''' is the oral insertion of an [[idiom|idiomatic translation]] in the [[mother tongue]] between an unknown phrase in the [[second language|learned language]] and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.\n\nWhen modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 => L1 => L2. For example, a [[German language|German]] teacher of [[English language|English]] might engage in the following exchange with the students:\n\n: Teacher: \"Let me try \u2013 lass mich versuchen \u2013 let me try.\"\n: Students: \"Let me try.\"\n\n===Mother tongue mirroring===\n{{main|Mother tongue mirroring}}\nMother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honoured technique of [[literal translation]] or word-for word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners and, in many cases, spare them the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from [[literal translation]] and [[interlinear text]] as used in the past since it takes the progress learners have made into account and only focuses upon a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. This technique is seldom referred to or used these days.\n\n===Back-chaining===\n{{main|Back-chaining}}\nBack-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with [[polysyllabic]] or difficult words.<ref name=\"ue\">\"Backchaining.\" ''Glossary.'' Retrieved 4 April 2009, from http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/backchaining.html</ref> The teacher pronounces the last syllable, the student repeats, and then the teacher continues, working backwards from the end of the word to the beginning.<ref>\"Backchaining.\" ''Teaching English.'' Retrieved 4 April 2009, from http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/knowledge-wiki/backchaining</ref>\n\nFor example, to teach the name \u2018[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]' a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: ''-sky,'' and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with ''-sorg-'' attached before: ''-sorg-sky,'' and all that remains is the first syllable: ''Mus-sorg-sky.''\n\n=== Code Switching ===\n{{Main|Code-switching|l1=Code switching}}\n\nCode switching is a special linguistic phenomenon that the speaker consciously alternates two or more languages according to different time, places, contents, objects and other factors. Code switching shows its functions while one is in the environment that mother tongue are not playing a dominant role in students' life and study, such as the children in the bilingual family or in the immigrant family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Juyoung|first=Song|date=March 2019|title=Language Socialization and Code-Switching: A Case Study of a Korean-English Bilingual Child in a Korean Transnational Family|journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education & Bilingualism|volume=22|issue=2|pages=91\u2013106|doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1231165}}</ref> That is to say, the capability of using code switching, relating to the transformation of phonetics, words, language structure, expression mode, thinking mode, cultural differences and so on, is needed to be guided and developed in the daily communication environment. Most people learn foreign language in the circumstance filled with the using of their native language so that their ability of code switching cannot be stimulated, and thus the efficiency of foreign language acquisition would decrease. Therefore, as a teaching strategy, code switching is used to help students better gain conceptual competences and to provide rich semantic context for them to understand some specific vocabularies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cahyani|first=Hilda|last2=de Courcy|first2=Michele|last3=Barnett|first3=Jenny|date=May 2018|title=Teachers' Code-Switching in Bilingual Classrooms: Exploring Pedagogical and Sociocultural Functions|journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education & Bilingualism|volume=21|issue=4|pages=465\u2013479|doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1189509}}</ref>\n\n==By region==\n{{main|Language education by region}}\n\nPractices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorisation and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]], in [[Asia]] or in [[Australia]].\n\n== By different life stage ==\n\n=== Early childhood education ===\n{{Main|Early childhood education|l1=Early Childhood Education}}\n\nEarly childhood is the fastest and most critical period for one to master language in their life. Children's language communication is transformed from non-verbal communication to verbal communication from ages of one to five. Their mastery of language is largely acquired naturally by living in a verbal communication environment. As long as we are good at guiding and creating opportunities for children, children's language ability is easy to be developed and cultivated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Linda|date=March 2004|title=Preschoolers Study Foreign Tongues|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=12835748&site=ehost-live.|journal=Education Week|volume=23|pages=1\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=McEntire|first=Nancy|date=March 2004|title=ECAP Report: Working With Preschool Children Who Are English Language Learners|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=12835748&site=ehost-live|journal=Childhood Education|volume=23|pages=172\u2013173}}</ref>\n\n=== Compulsory education ===\nCompulsory education, for most people, is the period that they have access to a second or foreign language for the first time. In this period, the most professional foreign language education and academic atmosphere are provided to the students. They can get help and motivation from teachers and be activated by the peers at any time. One would be able to undergo a lot of specialized learning in order to truly master a great number of rules of vocabulary, grammar and verbal communication.\n\n=== Adult education ===\n{{See also|Adult education|l1=Adult Education}}\n\nLearning a foreign language during adulthood means one is pursuing a higher value of himself by obtaining a new skill. At this stage, individuals have already developed study habit so that they own sufficient self-restrict ability to supervise themselves learning a language. However, at the same time, the pressure is also an obstacle for adults.\n\n=== Elderly education ===\nCompared to other life stage, this period is the hardest one to learning a new language because of the gradually brain deterioration and memory-loss. Meanwhile, language education for seniors can slow down the degeneration of brain and active ageing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schunova|first=Romana|date=2018|title=LANGUAGE EDUCATION OF SENIORS AS A TOOL OF ACTIVE AGEING|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=134101976&site=ehost-live|journal=Ad Alta: Journal of Interdisciplinary Research.|volume=8|pages=233\u2013238}}</ref>\n\n==Language study holidays==\n{{See also|Language school}}\nAn increasing number of people are now combining [[tourism|holiday]]s with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a [[homestay]], perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta & UK being the most popular because almost everyone speaks English as a first language) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and [[ACUPARI|Peru]]. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelweek.ca/news/travel-agents-missing-profitable-language-travel-holidays-sprachcaffe/ |title=Travel agents missing out on profitable language travel holidays \u2013 Sprachcaffe |publisher=TravelWeek|accessdate=4 March 2015|date=29 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWith the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one's disposal. This is also evident in businesses outsourcing their departments to Eastern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n==Minority language education==\n\n===Minority language education policy===\nThe principal policy arguments in favor of promoting minority language education are the need for multilingual workforces, intellectual and cultural benefits and greater inclusion in global information society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community |title=Community Languages in Higher Education: Towards realising the potential |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=Sachdev |first=I |author2=McPake, J  |year=2008 |pages=76 |publisher=Routes into Languages }}</ref> Access to education in a minority language is also seen as a human right as granted by the [[European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]], the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and the [[UN Human Rights Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |title=The right to education and minority language |accessdate=26 June 2009 |last=de Varennes |first=Fernand |year=2004 |publisher=EUMAP: EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program Online Journal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404121819/http://www.eumap.org/journal/features/2004/minority_education/edminlang |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>Hult, F.M.

There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands. Where it has against it a hostile army, it will oppose to it its own army. Where it is confronted with armed conspiracy, attempt at murder, or rising, it will hurl at the heads of its enemies an unsparing penalty.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\n[[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]], stated in the newspaper ''Red Terror'':\n\n{{Quote|We are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused.

We must carry along with us 90 million out of the 100 million of Soviet Russia's population. As for the rest, we have nothing to say to them.

In preparing this revolt, the Whites managed to smuggle more than 3000 rifles and machine guns into the city. The leaders of the plot decided to act on the night 9-10 March 1919. The rebels were joined by wealthy peasants from the villages, which suppressed the Committees of the Poor, and committed massacres against rural activists. Eyewitnesses reported atrocities in villages such as Ivanchug, Chagan, Karalat. In response, Soviet forces led by Kirov undertook to suppress this revolt in the villages, and together with the Committees of the Poor restored Soviet power. The revolt in Astrakhan was brought under control by 10 March, and completely defeated by the 12th.

Pipes has quoted Marx's observation of the class struggles in 19th century France: \"The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also ''perish'' in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world\", but noted that neither [[Karl Marx|Marx]] nor [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] encouraged mass murder.<ref name=\"Pipes\"/><ref>Karl Marx, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/ch03.htm  The Class Struggles in France] (1850).</ref> [[Robert Conquest]] was convinced that \"unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities\".<ref name=\"reflections\">Robert Conquest, ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000), {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[Orlando Figes]]' view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the [[Russian Revolution]]. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Mikhail Olminsky]], who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to \"Lenin's violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy&nbsp;... [t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\"<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

There was economic and political disorganization in the country, the radicalization of the masses, the devaluation of life and polarization of society that intensified during the First World War, leading to the emergence of mob justice, banditry, and riots. Increasingly, a violent solution to political and social problems were emphasized. Ratkovsky notes that the use of coercion was inherent to all parties to the conflict. <ref>[http://www.pseudology.org/Abel/PetroVchk1918_RedTerror.pdf \u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0412\u0427\u041a \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443. \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0418\u0437\u0434-\u0432\u043e \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431. \u0443\u043d-\u0442\u0430, 2006.] p.236</ref>\n\nRatkovsky places emphasis on the role of foreign countries in intensifying the civil war, involving German, Czechoslovakian, American, British, French, and Japanese forces. The use of repression was justified by the State on the basis of the foreignness of its enemies. There was the suppression of revolutions in Hungary, Germany, and especially Finland, which pushed for more decisive action by the Soviet state against its adversaries. Believing that its foes were diametrically opposed to it, the Soviet forces aimed at suppressing them, including their social basis. Thus, the repression was directed against ancien regime officials and military officers, policemen, and members of the upper classes <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nIn addition to clearing the old state apparatus, the Red Terror had a purpose in strengthening the Soviet state. According to Ratkovsky, the situation demanded the Bolsheviks retain power not only by suppressing rebellion, but also to prevent it at all costs, as well as signs of anarchy. The Red Terror sought to fix the problem of the spontaneous, individual terror. <ref>\u0418. \u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0442\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, p.237</ref>\n\nThe Red Terror in [[Soviet Russia]] was justified in the [[Soviet historiography]] as a wartime campaign against [[counter-revolutionaries]] during the Russian Civil War of 1918\u20131921, targeting those who sided with the Whites ([[White Army]]). Bolsheviks referred to any anti-Bolshevik factions as Whites, regardless of whether those factions actually supported the [[White movement]] cause. Leon Trotsky described the context in 1920:\n\n{{Quote|The severity of the proletarian dictatorship in Russia, let us point out here, was conditioned by no less difficult circumstances [than the [[French Revolution]]]. There was one continuous front, on the north and south, in the east and west. Besides the Russian [[White movement|White Guard]] armies of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]], [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] and others, there are those attacking Soviet Russia, simultaneously or in turn: Germans, Austrians, Czecho-Slovaks, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Roumanians, French, British, Americans, Japanese, Finns, Esthonians, Lithuanians ... In a country throttled by a blockade and strangled by hunger, there are conspiracies, risings, terrorist acts, and destruction of roads and bridges.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\nHe then went on to contrast the terror with the revolution and provide the Bolshevik's justification for it:\n\n{{Quote|The first conquest of power by the Soviets at the beginning of November 1917 (new style) was actually accomplished with insignificant sacrifices. The Russian bourgeoisie found itself to such a degree estranged from the masses of the people, so internally helpless, so compromised by the course and the result of the war, so demoralized by the regime of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]], that it scarcely dared show any resistance. ... A revolutionary class which has conquered power with arms in its hands is bound to, and will, suppress, rifle in hand, all attempts to tear the power out of its hands.

Where it is confronted with armed conspiracy, attempt at murder, or rising, it will hurl at the heads of its enemies an unsparing penalty.|{{harvp|Trotsky|1920|}} }}\n\n[[Martin Latsis]], chief of the Ukrainian [[Cheka]], stated in the newspaper ''Red Terror'':\n\n{{Quote|We are not fighting against single individuals. We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class. Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words.

[t]he Bolsheviks [would be] forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means\".{{sfnp|Figes|1998|pp=630, 649}} Figes also asserts that the Red Terror \"erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.\"{{sfnp|Figes|1998|p=525}}\n\nThe German Marxist [[Karl Kautsky]] pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism, because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population, and included the taking and executing hostages. \"Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all\".<ref>[[Karl Kautsky]], [http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1919/terrcomm/ch08b.htm#s6 ''Terrorism and Communism''] Chapter VIII, The Communists at Work, The Terror</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', [[Nicolas Werth]] contrasts the Red and [[White Terror (Russia)|White terrors]], noting the former was the official policy of the Bolshevik government:\n\n<blockquote>The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]] himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.{{sfnp|Werth, Bartosek et al.|1999|p=82}}</blockquote>\n\nYuri Semyonov argues that \"apologists for the Whites, trying to justify them, often say: the White Terror simply amounted to the excesses of individuals wronged by the Bolsheviks, while the Red Terror was a deliberate policy of the Bolsheviks in general and particularly Lenin. This, however, is not true.\" Semyonov cites documents from Siberia stating \"it's forbidden to arrest the workers, you're commanded to shoot or hang them.\" Kolchak himself issued an order to \"I order you to shoot all captured Communists. Now we rely on the bayonet.\" Kolchak's governor for Yenisei region Lieutenant-General S. Rozanov issued an order stating \"The villages, whose people meet  government troops with weapons, burn them down and shoot the adult males without exception. Confiscate property, horses, wagons, and grains in favor of the treasury.\" <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJames Ryan points out that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=116}}  He did intend to bring about \"the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie\", but through non-violent political and economic means.{{sfnp|Ryan|2012|p=74}}\n\n[[Leszek Ko\u0142akowski]] noted that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of \"violent revolution\" and [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] long before the [[October Revolution]]. Implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906 where he argued it must involve \"unlimited power based on force and not on law\", \"absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence\". In ''[[The State and Revolution]]'' of 1917 Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices calling for moderate use of violence, such as Kautsky's, met \"furious reply\" from Lenin in ''[[The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky]]'' (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky's reservations was written by  [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] in ''[[Terrorism and Communism|The Defense of Terrorism]]'' (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it's sufficient that the \"violence is successful\" for it to justify its \"rightness\". Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system, such as \"militarization of labor\" and concentration camps.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Main currents of Marxism|last=Ko\u0142akowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W.W.

In 1988, ''[[The World's Greatest Entertainer]]'' was released, featuring the song \"Keep Risin' To The Top\", which was named after [[Keni Burke]]'s then-obscure 1981 hit \"Rising To The Top\" (which has since become Burke's signature song). Doug E. Fresh's \"Keep Risin' To The Top\" also samples the main chorus of [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave's]] 1976 classic \"Ain't No Half Steppin',\" which [[Big Daddy Kane]] also sampled that same year for his song of the same name.\n\nIn 1992, after a four-year hiatus, Doug E. Fresh joined [[MC Hammer]]'s label Bust It Records and issued the album ''[[Doin' What I Gotta Do]]'', a commercial failure despite some minor acclaim for the single \"Bustin' Out (On Funk)\", which sampled [[Rick James]]' 1979 single \"Bustin' Out\".\n\nIn 1993, Doug E. Fresh found a new home at [[Island Records]]-affiliated label [[Gee Street Records|Gee Street]]. However, he only released one single containing three songs: \"I-ight (Alright)\" (the main track), \"Bounce\" and \"Freaks\". Although \"I-ight\" (which originated the now-famous club chant \"Heyyyyyy, YO!... I-iiiiight?\") was slated to become the first major hit for Doug E. Fresh in five years, it was almost immediately overshadowed by \"Freaks\", a [[dancehall]] tune beatboxed entirely by Doug E. Fresh and vocalized mainly by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a Brooklyn-born Jamaican teenage newcomer named [[Vicious (rapper)|Vicious]]. The song received major radio and club play, followed by video play in early 1994. Vicious would soon ink a deal with [[Sony Music]]'s [[Epic Records]] for three years, although he would only release one album, ''[[Destination Brooklyn]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh reunited for a track on an album titled ''[[Play (Doug E. Fresh album)|Play]]'', which received positive reviews; Bret Love wrote, \"A welcome flashback to the days when guns, drugs, sex, and violence were not the genre's primary lyrical focus.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bret Love |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/play-mw0000175377 |title=Play - Doug E.

Fresh resurfaced when rap group [[Cali Swag District]] brought back some of his trademark dance moves for their song \"[[Teach Me How to Dougie]].\" Members of Cali Swag District saw [[Texas]] college students doing a local dance created in [[Dallas]] called the \"D-Town Boogie\".  They recognized it as a modified version of Doug E. Fresh's dance moves and created a song that would feature the dance, but also give Fresh his due credit.\n\nOn June 27, 2010, Doug E. Fresh performed with Cali Swag District on \"Teach Me How to Dougie\" at the [[BET Awards]] pre-show. He also performed a concert called \"The Show\" at the Paradise Theater on August 12, 2010. On November 8, 2010, Fresh appeared at the [[Soul Train Awards]], where he taught CNN anchor [[Wolf Blitzer]] how to [[Dougie]] on stage as part of the show. On December 10, 2010, Fresh appeared on [[ESPN First Take]] to speak about the phenomenon of the Dougie as a sports celebration and voted on the best sports-related Dougie dances, selecting that of host [[Skip Bayless]], though he rated Wolf Blitzer's Dougie at the [[Soul Train Awards]] as better but with no sports association.\n\nOn October 28, 2011 Doug E. Fresh performed at the Paradise Theater in a concert to benefit New York City's public hospitals; the show was part of \"STAT! for NYC's Public Hospitals\" to raise funds to reduce gun violence.

The pioneer of 20th-century American [[beatboxing]], Fresh is able to accurately imitate [[drum machine]]s and various [[special effect]]s using only his [[human mouth|mouth]], [[lip]]s, [[gums]], [[throat]], [[tongue]] and a [[microphone]].\n\n==Music career==\nDoug E. Fresh began his recording career as a solo [[artist]]; he was among the last artists on [[Enjoy Records]] and one of the first on Vintertainment Records (the same New York-based label owned by Vincent Davis that would later make a name of hip-hop artist Joeski Love and bring [[R&B]] singer [[Keith Sweat]] to ultimate fame). He and a new team of DJs known as the Get Fresh Crew (Barry Bee and Chill Will), along with newcomer MC Ricky D (who would later achieve fame as [[Slick Rick]]), came to fledgling New Jersey-based hip-hop label [[Fantasy Records|Danya/Reality Records]] the following year and recorded \"[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]\", which borrowed the melody of the ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' theme by [[Shuki Levy]].<ref>Blow Your Mind Wide Open, Charles Mudede, ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', August 28, 2003.</ref> They also recorded \"[[La Di Da Di]]\", a tune that was completely voiced by MC Ricky D and backed by Doug E. Fresh's beatboxing for the entire duration of the song. The release of these two songs as a 12\" single launched Doug E. Fresh (and Slick Rick) into stardom. Both songs are considered among the greatest early [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] classics. \"The Show\" peaked at #7 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in December 1985.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited\n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 215}}</ref>\n\nDoug E.

It is usually made during [[Diwali]] or [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]], [[Onam]], [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]] and other Hindu festivals in the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent.]] Designs are passed from one generation to the next, keeping both the [[art]] form and the [[tradition]] alive.\n\nThe purpose of rangoli is to feel strength, generosity, and it is thought to bring good luck. Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by girls or women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.\n\nRangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which [[sindooram]] (vermilion), [[Turmeric|pasupu]] (turmeric) and other natural colours can be added.

It is considered auspicious as it signifies showering of good luck and prosperity on the house and in the family. It is not drawn like a picture. Patterns are created based on certain systems. Generally, women get up early in the morning and clean the area just outside the entrance of their houses with cow dung, sprinkle the area with water and draw the Chaook. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, rangolis are drawn on the doors of homes so that evil forces attempting to enter are repelled. During the festival of [[Onam]] in Kerala, flowers are laid down for each of the ten days of the celebration, the design growing larger and more complex every day.

The Murja festival is observed during the auspicious month of Kartika ending on Kartika Purnima.\n\nThe Rangoli's most important element is being colourful. These are auspicious symbols that have a central role in the design. The design for generations are passed on as they are made \u2013 and is required to make these symbols. Traditionally, each new generation learns the art and thus a family keeps the tradition intact. Some major symbols used in Rangoli are the lotus flower, its leaves, mango, Tue vase, fish, different kind of birds like parrots, swans, peacocks, and human figures and foliage. Oftentimes Rangoli is made on special occasions like Diwali. Some special patterns for Diwali Rangoli are the Diya also called Deep, Ganesha, Lakshmi, flowers or birds of India.\n\nThe second key element is using the materials used to make the rangoli. The materials used are easily found everywhere. Therefore, this art is prevalent in all homes, rich or poor. Normally the major ingredients used to make rangoli are \u2013 Pise rice solution, the dried powder made from the leaves color, charcoal, burned soil was, wood sawdust, etc..\n\nThe third important element is the background. Rangoli use the background of a clear floor or wall or Llype is used. Rangoli can be made in a yard in the middle, corners, or as a bell is created around.\n\nDehri gateway is a tradition of making rangoli. God's seat, depending on lamp, place of worship and sacrifice on the altar is a tradition of decorating rangoli. With time, imagination and innovative ideas in Rangoli art is also incorporated. Hospitality and tourism has also had its effect and rangoli has been commercially developed in places such as hotels. Its traditional charm, artistry and importance still remain.\n\nRangoli is also created using coloured rice, dry flour, flower petals, turmeric (pasupu), Vermillion (Sindooram) and coloured sand. The patterns include the face of Hindu deities, geometric shapes peacock motifs, and round floral designs. Many of these motifs are traditional and are handed down by the previous generations. This makes rangoli a representation of India's rich heritage and the fact that it is a land of festivals and colour. People celebrate rangoli with davali patterns.\n\n==Creation of Rangoli==\nThere are two primary ways to make a Rangoli, dry and wet, referring to the materials used to create the outline and (if desired) fill that outline with colour. Using a white material like [[chalk]], sand, paint or flour, the artist marks a centre-point on the ground and cardinal points around it, usually in a square, hexagon or circle depending on region and personal preference. Ramifying that initially-simple pattern creates what is often an intricate and beautiful design. Motifs from nature (leaves, petals, feathers) and [[pattern|geometric patterns]] are common. Less common but by no means rare are representational forms (like a [[peacock]], icon or landscape). \"Readymade Rangoli\" patterns, often as [[stencil]]s or stickers, are becoming common, making it easier to create detailed or precise designs.\n\nOnce the outline is complete, the artist may choose to illuminate it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or [[pigment|dry pigments]]. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like [[crayon]]s, dyes or dyed fabrics, [[acrylic paints]] and artificial colouring agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.\n\nShape, design and material can be influenced by regional traditions. A square grid is common in North India as is a hexagonal grid in South India; [[Onam]] Rangolis are typically circular. In North India, the colour is most often based on gypsum (chirodi), in South India on rice flour and Onam Rangolis are typically flower based. The rapid and widespread migration and mixing of people within India can be seen by the way these styles are now freely adopted and mixed across the country. It is also becoming common to see experimentation like sawdust-based floating Rangolis, freeform designs, and exotic materials.\n\nIt is particularly notable that the Tamil version of the Rangoli, the [[Kolam]], prizes symmetry, complexity, precision, and intricacy rather than the flamboyance of Rangolis found in North India. Many people find it enjoyable to try and figure out how such intricate designs are drawn with a grid, and hence, it allows the mind to be exercised.\n\n==Faith and beliefs==\n[[File:Rangoli_of_pongal_festival_in_India.jpg|thumb|200px|A rangoli made in front of a house]]\nIn India, there is a prevalent myth that [[Andal|Andaal]] worshipped Lord [[Thirumaal]] and was married to him in the month of Margazhi. During this month, unmarried girls get up before dawn and draw a Rangoli to welcome the God Thirumal. Mentions of rangoli creation are also found in Hindu mythology. There are also references of Rangoli in legends such as Ramayana - at Sita's wedding pavilion where there is a discussion about Rangoli. Cultural development of Rangoli in the South originated in the era of the Chola Rulers.\nThere are modern and traditional rangoli designs. The designs are usually inspired by nature, but they can also be in the form of abstract art.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Rangoli in India.jpg|Rangoli is either left as uncoloured drawing or it is filled with various coloured powders\nFile:HiH - Events - World Childs Prize Vote- 08-03-18 - 33 (2485514943).jpg|Rangoli of Global Events\nFile:Rangoli.jpg|Rangoli in Singapore\nFile:Alpana 2.jpg|Alpana (painted Rangoli) in Rajshahi, Bangladesh\nFile:Aruppukottai Kolam.jpg|Rangoli of Peacock in [[Tamil Nadu]]\nFile:Rangoli.hrushikesh.3030.jpg|Nature Scene in Rangoli during a [[Vijayadashami]] festival, in Maharashtra\nFile:Birds of feather-Wikimedia-GNUnify2013 17.jpg|A Tux rangoli by students at [[GNUnify]]'13, Pune\nFile:rangoli filled.jpg|Rangoli is drawn in front of the house especially on festival days\nFile:Rangoli art.jpg|Rangoli in making\nFile:Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould selling vendor, Bangalore.webm|Rangoli being prepared by a Rangoli mould vendor in Bangalore\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kolam]]\n*[[Chowk poorana]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Rangoli}}\n* Selin, Helaine (2008).

Design depictions may also vary as they reflect traditions, folklore, and practices that are unique to each area. It is traditionally done by girls or women. Generally, this practice is showcased during occasions such as festivals, auspicious observances, marriage celebrations and other similar milestones and gatherings.\n\nRangoli designs can be simple geometric shapes, deity impressions, or flower and petal shapes (appropriate for the given celebrations), but they can also be very elaborate designs crafted by numerous people. The base material is usually dry or wet powdered rice or dry flour, to which [[sindooram]] (vermilion), [[Turmeric|pasupu]] (turmeric) and other natural colours can be added. Chemical colors are a modern variation.
