He was first elected in 1998 and previously served as [[Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives]]. Before that, he was House Minority Leader six years (2004\u201310) and was twice chairman of the [[Alabama Republican Party]] (2007\u201311). Mike Hubbard is the owner of the Auburn based radio stations WANI, WGZZ, W-LEE, and ESPN 106.7. In addition to the radio stations Mike Hubbard also holds a TV station construction permit and a fifth radio station construction permit. Mike Hubbard has stated that he does not take an income from his radio stations and has moved ownership from his name to his wife's name Susan Hubbard to protect his investment. Mike Hubbard has admitted that he paid his staff members a total of $30,000.00 dollars each if they could convince voters to help turn the state red which he and his staff members accomplished.\n\nAs the Alabama GOP chairman, Hubbard created and headed the most comprehensive fundraising and coordinated campaign plan in the party's history. The effort raised over $5&nbsp;million and, in the November 2010 general election, resulted in Republicans winning every statewide office, picking up a Congressional seat and taking majorities in both Houses of the Alabama Legislature for the first time in the 136 years since the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\nIn 2016, Hubbard was sentenced to four years in prison for felony violations of state ethics laws.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Football Rivalry That Could Decide the Alabama Senate Race|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/31/jimmy-rane-luther-strange-alabama-football-215210|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=POLITICO Magazine|date=31 May 2017}}</ref> Per state law, he was removed as a member of the House.<ref name=June10>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/house_speaker_mike_hubbard_con.html |title=Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard convicted on 12 counts |work=The Birmingham News |author=Mike Cason |date=June 10, 2016 |accessdate=June 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHubbard is a broadcaster and businessman in [[Auburn, Alabama]].

He was first elected in 1998 and previously served as [[Speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives]]. Before that, he was House Minority Leader six years (2004\u201310) and was twice chairman of the [[Alabama Republican Party]] (2007\u201311). Mike Hubbard is the owner of the Auburn based radio stations WANI, WGZZ, W-LEE, and ESPN 106.7. In addition to the radio stations Mike Hubbard also holds a TV station construction permit and a fifth radio station construction permit. Mike Hubbard has stated that he does not take an income from his radio stations and has moved ownership from his name to his wife's name Susan Hubbard to protect his investment. Mike Hubbard has admitted that he paid his staff members a total of $30,000.00 dollars each if they could convince voters to help turn the state red which he and his staff members accomplished.\n\nAs the Alabama GOP chairman, Hubbard created and headed the most comprehensive fundraising and coordinated campaign plan in the party's history. The effort raised over $5&nbsp;million and, in the November 2010 general election, resulted in Republicans winning every statewide office, picking up a Congressional seat and taking majorities in both Houses of the Alabama Legislature for the first time in the 136 years since the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\nIn 2016, Hubbard was sentenced to four years in prison for felony violations of state ethics laws.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Football Rivalry That Could Decide the Alabama Senate Race|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/31/jimmy-rane-luther-strange-alabama-football-215210|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=POLITICO Magazine|date=31 May 2017}}</ref> Per state law, he was removed as a member of the House.<ref name=June10>{{cite web |url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/house_speaker_mike_hubbard_con.html |title=Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard convicted on 12 counts |work=The Birmingham News |author=Mike Cason |date=June 10, 2016 |accessdate=June 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHubbard is a broadcaster and businessman in [[Auburn, Alabama]].

its formation on 23 May 1949 and [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990. During this [[Cold War]] period, the western portion of Germany was part of the [[Western Bloc]]. The Federal Republic was created during the [[Allied occupation of Germany]] after [[World War II]], established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. Its (provisional) capital was the city of [[Bonn]]. The Cold War era West Germany is also retrospectively designated the '''Bonn Republic'''.<ref>The Bonn Republic&nbsp;\u2014 West German democracy, 1945-1990, Anthony James Nicholls, Longman, 1997</ref>\n\nAt the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was {{lang|la|de facto}} divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and a divided Berlin. Initially, the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871\u20131945 [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) was an illegally constituted [[puppet state]]. Though the GDR did hold regular elections, these were neither free nor fair. From the West German perspective, the GDR was therefore illegitimate.  \n\nThree southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952, and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered a {{lang|la|de facto}} eleventh state. While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin politically aligned itself with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.\n\nThe foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (economic miracle) of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third-largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with [[NATO]] rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in NATO but was also a proponent of agreements which developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[G8|G6]] was established in 1975, there was no question  as to whether West Germany would become a member.\n\nFollowing the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989]], symbolised by the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opening]] of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. [[East Germany]] voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990. Its [[New states of Germany|five post-war states]] ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from ten to sixteen, ending the division of Germany. The reunion did not result in a new country;  instead, the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession, whereby West Germany was enlarged to include the additional states of East Germany, which had ceased to exist. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like UN, NATO, OECD and the European Union.\n\n==Naming conventions==\n\nThe official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is {{lang|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}} (Federal Republic of Germany).\n\nIn East Germany, the terms {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} (West Germany) or {{lang|de|westdeutsche Bundesrepublik}} (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|1968 constitution]], when the idea of a single German nation was abandoned by East Germany, and as a result West Germans and West Berliners were officially considered foreigners. In the early 1970s, starting in the East German {{lang|de|[[Neues Deutschland]]}}, the initialism \"[[BRD (Germany)|BRD]]\" (FRG) for the \"Federal Republic of Germany\" began to prevail in East German usage. In 1973, official East German sources adopted it as a standard expression and other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations soon followed suit.\n\nIn reaction to this move, in 1965 the West German [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] [[Erich Mende]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'', recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974, the heads of West German federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications. From then on West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} that the West German public broadcasters {{lang|de|[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]}} and {{lang|de|[[ZDF]]}} had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.<ref>See in general: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, \"Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abk\u00fcrzung \u00abBRD\u00bb\"], in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag&nbsp;\u2013 Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code of West Germany was \"DE\" (for ''Deutschland'', Germany), which has remained the country code of Germany after reunification. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the most widely used country codes, and the \"DE\" code is notably used as a country identifier extending the postal code and as the Internet's country code top-level domain [[.de]]. The less widely used [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] country code of West Germany was \"DEU\", which has also remained the country code of reunified Germany. The now deleted codes for East Germany, on the other hand, were \"DD\" in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and \"DDR\" in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3.\n\nThe colloquial term \"West Germany\" or its equivalent was used in many languages. \"{{lang|de|Westdeutschland}}\" was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.\n\n==History==\n{{History of Germany}}\n{{Further|History of Germany (1945\u201390)}}\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|upright|[[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation zone borders]] in Germany, 1947.

[[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] was an American [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the British zone. Berlin was a four-power area within the Soviet zone.]]\n\nOn 4\u201311 February 1945 leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe and [[Pacific War|Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific]] were negotiated. Throughout the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] had followed a policy of reclaiming German lands lost in the [[Versailles Treaty]], and of reuniting other territories occupied by German peoples within the [[German Reich]], so the Allies agreed that the boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German national territory from German occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937 were automatically null.  Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be 'valid in international law'; although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that East Prussia and Silesia must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any Peace agreement. The conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]: a [[France|French]] Zone in the far west; a [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest; an [[United States|American]] Zone in the south; and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Zone in the East. [[Berlin]] was separately divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany, only to designate zones of administration.\n\nBy the subsequent [[Potsdam Agreement]], the four Allied Powers asserted joint sovereignty over 'Germany as a whole', defined as the  totality of the territory within the occupation zones. Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] and outside of 'Germany as a whole' were separated from German sovereignty in July 1945 and transferred from Soviet military occupation to Polish and Soviet (in the case of the territory of Kaliningrad) civil administration, their Polish and Soviet status to be confirmed at a final Peace Treaty.  Following wartime commitments by the Allies to the governments-in-exile of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], the Potsdam Protocols also agreed to the 'orderly and humane' transfer to Germany as a whole of the ethnic German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and [[Hungary]]. Eight million German expellees and refugees eventually settled in West Germany. Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge. First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]]. Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. Conversely, the Russian zone became [[East Germany]]. At the same time, new federal states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were formed in the Allied zones; replacing the geography of pre-Nazi German states such as the [[Free State of Prussia]] and the [[Republic of Baden]], which had derived ultimately from former independent German kingdoms and principalities.\n\nIn the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime was characterised as having been a 'criminal' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xxiv,</ref> illegal and illegitimate from the outset; while the [[Weimar Republic]] was characterised as having been a 'failed' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xv,</ref> whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national political, judicial, administrative, and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that a new West Germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|title=How a constitution can safeguard democracy:The German Experience|author=Jutta Limbach|publisher=Goethe-Institut|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220115032/https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nevertheless, the new West Germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the 'overall' German state that was held to have embodied the unified German people since the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848, and which from 1871 had been represented within the [[German Reich]]; albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 May 1945.\n\nIn 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948\u201349), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], eventually became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] (also known as the \"Two-plus-Four Agreement\"); by which transitional status of Germany following [[World War II]] was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law (a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before). The Two-plus-Four Agreement also saw the two parts of Germany confirm their post-war external boundaries as final and irreversible (including the 1945 transfer of former German lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]), and the Allied Powers confirmed their consent to German Reunification.  From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}, the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].\n\n===NATO membership===\n<!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]] and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]-->\n[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow) after the accession of the Saarland in 1957 and before the five {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}} from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]\n\nWith territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old [[Medieval]] [[East Francia]] and the 19th-century [[Napoleonic]] [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, under the terms of the [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] it obtained \"the full authority of a sovereign state\" on 5 May 1955 (although \"full sovereignty\" was not obtained until the [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] in 1990).{{refn |name=Sovereignty |group=lower-alpha |Detlef Junker of the {{lang|de|[[Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg]]}} states \"In the October 23, 1954, Paris Agreements, Adenauer pushed through the following laconic wording: 'The Federal Republic shall accordingly [after termination of the occupation regime] have the full authority of a sovereign state over its internal and external affairs.'

Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.\n\nThough the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Then other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}}. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in the case of an external attack against Germany or its allies ({{lang|de|B\u00fcndnisfall}}). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.<ref>John A. Reed Jr, ''Germany and NATO'' (National Defense University, 1987) [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a264257.pdf Online].</ref>\n\nThe three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)\n\n===Reforms during the 1960s===\n[[Konrad Adenauer]] was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker. However, he stayed in power for 14 years. The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963.<ref>William Glenn Gray,  \"Adenauer, Erhard, and the Uses of Prosperity.\" ''German Politics and Society'' 25.2 (2007): 86-103.</ref>\n\n{{Main|Spiegel scandal}}\nIn October 1962 the weekly news magazine {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]}} published an analysis of the West German military defence. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of {{lang|de|Der Spiegel}} in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further. He announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963. His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.<ref>Alfred C. Mierzejewski, ''Ludwig Erhard: A Biography'' (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2005) p 179. [https://www.questia.com/library/120073119/ludwig-erhard-a-biography Online]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.\n\nA new coalition was formed to deal with this problem. Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. He led a [[grand coalition]] between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.\n\n[[File:Rudi.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]\nDuring the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|Notstand der Demokratie}} (\"Democracy in Crisis\") and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament.  A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the [[Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as {{lang|de|Jubelperser}}), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the [[Vietnam War|US intervention in Vietnam]], mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.<ref>Kraushaar, Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung, Vol. 2 Rogner und Bernhard, 1998 Dokument Nr. 193, p. 356</ref>\n\nIn the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the [[Nuremberg trials|War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg]] had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|{{lang|de|Auschwitz|nocat=y}} concentration camp]] and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that [[the Holocaust|the {{lang|he-Latn|Shoah|nocat=y}}]] was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term \"Holocaust\" for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when a 1978 [[Holocaust (miniseries)|American mini-series with that name]] was shown on West German television.)  The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.\n\nThe calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a [[Feminism in Germany|feminist movement]] in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.<ref>Reconciliation Policy in Germany 1998\u20132008, Construing the 'Problem' of the Incompatibility of Paid Employment and Care Work, by Cornelius Grebe; pg 92: ''\"However, the 1977 reform of marriage and family law by Social Democrats and Liberals formally gave women the right to take up employment without their spouses' permission.

In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt, they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the \"struggle against imperialism\".<ref>Kraushaar op.cit</ref>  The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the [[Maoist]]s and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the [[Red Brigades]] ({{lang|de|Brigate Rosse}}), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the [[Red Army Faction]] which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |title=RAF: Gefangen in der Geschichte |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508122346/http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Willy Brandt===\n{{main|Willy Brandt}}\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by [[Willy Brandt]]\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.<ref>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Miard-Delacroixm ''Willy Brandt: Life of a Statesman'' (2016)</ref> Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries. (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972.)<ref>Informationen zur Politische Bildung Heft 258, p. 32</ref> These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long-term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over Eastern Europe.

Following democratic elections, East Germany declared its accession to the Federal Republic subject to the terms of the Unification Treaty between the two states; and then both West Germany and East Germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that Treaty's provisions. East Germany then dissolved itself, and its five post-war states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}.

The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building|{{lang|de|Reichstag|nocat=y}} building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.\n\nHowever, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].\n\n==West German \"economic miracle\"==\nThe West German {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}} (\"economic miracle\", coined by ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950) was due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  This improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the {{lang|de|[[Reichsmark]]}} with the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mark]]}} and halted rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038788-0006, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk, K\u00e4fer.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]]{{spaced ndash}}for many years the most successful car in the world{{spaced ndash}}on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973]]\n\nAs demand for consumer goods increased after World War II, the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of {{lang|de|[[Gastarbeiter]]}} (\"guest workers\") provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.<ref>[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519121934/https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=19 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWith the dropping of Allied reparations, the freeing of German intellectual property and the impact of the Marshall Plan stimulus, West Germany developed one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War.

Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]\n\nThe official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of \"{{lang|de|Neue [[Ostpolitik]]}}\" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany as a whole.\n\nFollowing the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state.  By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 14]}}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and  agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 308}}</ref>\n: \"... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.\" <ref>{{citation|url=https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|title=Texas Law: Foreign Law Translations 1973|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152049/https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe West German Constitution ({{lang|de|Grundgesetz}}, \"Basic Law\") provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:\n\n* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).\n* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.\n\nAfter the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR and the re-establishment of {{lang|de|[[New states of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]}} on the territory of East Germany; and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had nominally declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.\n\nThe two German states entered into a [[monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the re-established [[New states of Germany|five East German {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder|nocat=y}}]] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.\n\n==Politics==\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966\u201369). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other right-wing parties.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, the [[Villa Hammerschmidt]] ]]\nKiesinger's 1966\u201369 \"Grand Coalition\" was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts\u2014the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].\n\nLeading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|[[Notstand der Demokratie]]}} (\"Democracy in a State of Emergency\") and the [[trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.\n\nBy 1968 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1970s [[environmentalism]] and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result, in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.\n\nAnother result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021 Kohl (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1987]]\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression<ref>[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901014759/http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html |date=1 September 2009 }} on 21 October 2002</ref><ref>Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen: ''Willy Brandt.

As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time\".<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113174538/http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all |date=13 January 2009 }} In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>\n\nFinance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD\u2013FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".\n\nThe goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.\n\n===Denazification===\n{{See also|Denazification|List of companies involved in the Holocaust}}\nIn 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany. West German President [[Walter Scheel]] and Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] were both former members of the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1957, 77% of the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|West German Ministry of Justice]]'s senior officials were former Nazi Party members.<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's post-war justice ministry was infested with Nazis protecting former comrades, study reveals |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 October 2016 |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223605/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |archive-date=23 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Konrad Adenauer's State Secretary [[Hans Globke]] had played a major role in drafting anti-semitic [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] in Nazi Germany.<ref>Tetens, T.H.

Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] held in West Germany]]\n\nIn the 20th century, [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2\u20131 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAfter both [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1936]] had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called \"West German\" before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs of 2012, West Germany have played a record 43 matches at the European Championships.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=2013 Guinness World Records Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257 257]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257}}</ref>\n\n\n===Literary scene===\nBesides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the {{lang|de|[[Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur]]}}. [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] (and its  [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]]) soon developed into a regarded institution. Exemplary for West Germany's literature are \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Siegfried Lenz]] (with ''[[The German Lesson]]'') and [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] (with ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' and ''[[The Flounder]]'').\n\n==Geographical distribution of government==\n\nIn West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].\n\nThe West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts ({{lang|de|Bezirke}}), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}}, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.\n\n==Present geographical and political terminology==\nToday, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[Western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the {{lang|de|Alte Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (old states) and the {{lang|de|Neue Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (new states), although {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} and {{lang|de|Ostdeutschland}} are still heard as well.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany}}\n* [[Economic history of the German reunification]]\n* [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]]\n* [[Petersberg Agreement]]\n* [[West Berlin]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bark, Dennis L., and David R.

Initially, the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871\u20131945 [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) was an illegally constituted [[puppet state]]. Though the GDR did hold regular elections, these were neither free nor fair. From the West German perspective, the GDR was therefore illegitimate.  \n\nThree southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1952, and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered a {{lang|la|de facto}} eleventh state. While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin politically aligned itself with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.\n\nThe foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (economic miracle) of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third-largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with [[NATO]] rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in NATO but was also a proponent of agreements which developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[G8|G6]] was established in 1975, there was no question  as to whether West Germany would become a member.\n\nFollowing the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989]], symbolised by the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opening]] of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. [[East Germany]] voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990. Its [[New states of Germany|five post-war states]] ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from ten to sixteen, ending the division of Germany. The reunion did not result in a new country;  instead, the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession, whereby West Germany was enlarged to include the additional states of East Germany, which had ceased to exist. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like UN, NATO, OECD and the European Union.\n\n==Naming conventions==\n\nThe official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is {{lang|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}} (Federal Republic of Germany).\n\nIn East Germany, the terms {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} (West Germany) or {{lang|de|westdeutsche Bundesrepublik}} (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|1968 constitution]], when the idea of a single German nation was abandoned by East Germany, and as a result West Germans and West Berliners were officially considered foreigners. In the early 1970s, starting in the East German {{lang|de|[[Neues Deutschland]]}}, the initialism \"[[BRD (Germany)|BRD]]\" (FRG) for the \"Federal Republic of Germany\" began to prevail in East German usage. In 1973, official East German sources adopted it as a standard expression and other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations soon followed suit.\n\nIn reaction to this move, in 1965 the West German [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] [[Erich Mende]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'', recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974, the heads of West German federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications. From then on West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} that the West German public broadcasters {{lang|de|[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]}} and {{lang|de|[[ZDF]]}} had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.<ref>See in general: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, \"Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abk\u00fcrzung \u00abBRD\u00bb\"], in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag&nbsp;\u2013 Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code of West Germany was \"DE\" (for ''Deutschland'', Germany), which has remained the country code of Germany after reunification. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the most widely used country codes, and the \"DE\" code is notably used as a country identifier extending the postal code and as the Internet's country code top-level domain [[.de]]. The less widely used [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] country code of West Germany was \"DEU\", which has also remained the country code of reunified Germany. The now deleted codes for East Germany, on the other hand, were \"DD\" in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and \"DDR\" in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3.\n\nThe colloquial term \"West Germany\" or its equivalent was used in many languages. \"{{lang|de|Westdeutschland}}\" was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.\n\n==History==\n{{History of Germany}}\n{{Further|History of Germany (1945\u201390)}}\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|upright|[[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation zone borders]] in Germany, 1947.

[[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] was an American [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the British zone. Berlin was a four-power area within the Soviet zone.]]\n\nOn 4\u201311 February 1945 leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe and [[Pacific War|Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific]] were negotiated. Throughout the 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] had followed a policy of reclaiming German lands lost in the [[Versailles Treaty]], and of reuniting other territories occupied by German peoples within the [[German Reich]], so the Allies agreed that the boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German national territory from German occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937 were automatically null.  Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be 'valid in international law'; although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that East Prussia and Silesia must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any Peace agreement. The conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]: a [[France|French]] Zone in the far west; a [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest; an [[United States|American]] Zone in the south; and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Zone in the East. [[Berlin]] was separately divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany, only to designate zones of administration.\n\nBy the subsequent [[Potsdam Agreement]], the four Allied Powers asserted joint sovereignty over 'Germany as a whole', defined as the  totality of the territory within the occupation zones. Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] and outside of 'Germany as a whole' were separated from German sovereignty in July 1945 and transferred from Soviet military occupation to Polish and Soviet (in the case of the territory of Kaliningrad) civil administration, their Polish and Soviet status to be confirmed at a final Peace Treaty.  Following wartime commitments by the Allies to the governments-in-exile of [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], the Potsdam Protocols also agreed to the 'orderly and humane' transfer to Germany as a whole of the ethnic German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and [[Hungary]]. Eight million German expellees and refugees eventually settled in West Germany. Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge. First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]]. Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. Conversely, the Russian zone became [[East Germany]]. At the same time, new federal states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were formed in the Allied zones; replacing the geography of pre-Nazi German states such as the [[Free State of Prussia]] and the [[Republic of Baden]], which had derived ultimately from former independent German kingdoms and principalities.\n\nIn the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime was characterised as having been a 'criminal' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xxiv,</ref> illegal and illegitimate from the outset; while the [[Weimar Republic]] was characterised as having been a 'failed' state,<ref>Justin Collings, ''Democracy's Guardian: A History of the German Federal Constitutional Court'', Oxford; OUP, 2015, pp xv,</ref> whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national political, judicial, administrative, and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that a new West Germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|title=How a constitution can safeguard democracy:The German Experience|author=Jutta Limbach|publisher=Goethe-Institut|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220115032/https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Nevertheless, the new West Germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the 'overall' German state that was held to have embodied the unified German people since the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848, and which from 1871 had been represented within the [[German Reich]]; albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 May 1945.\n\nIn 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948\u201349), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], eventually became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] (also known as the \"Two-plus-Four Agreement\"); by which transitional status of Germany following [[World War II]] was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law (a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before). The Two-plus-Four Agreement also saw the two parts of Germany confirm their post-war external boundaries as final and irreversible (including the 1945 transfer of former German lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]]), and the Allied Powers confirmed their consent to German Reunification.  From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}, the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].\n\n===NATO membership===\n<!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]] and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]-->\n[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow) after the accession of the Saarland in 1957 and before the five {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}} from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]\n\nWith territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old [[Medieval]] [[East Francia]] and the 19th-century [[Napoleonic]] [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, under the terms of the [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]] it obtained \"the full authority of a sovereign state\" on 5 May 1955 (although \"full sovereignty\" was not obtained until the [[Two Plus Four Agreement]] in 1990).{{refn |name=Sovereignty |group=lower-alpha |Detlef Junker of the {{lang|de|[[Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg]]}} states \"In the October 23, 1954, Paris Agreements, Adenauer pushed through the following laconic wording: 'The Federal Republic shall accordingly [after termination of the occupation regime] have the full authority of a sovereign state over its internal and external affairs.'

The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948\u201349, which was overcome by the [[Berlin airlift]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]]]]\nThe outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.\n\nThough the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Then other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}}. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in the case of an external attack against Germany or its allies ({{lang|de|B\u00fcndnisfall}}). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.<ref>John A. Reed Jr, ''Germany and NATO'' (National Defense University, 1987) [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a264257.pdf Online].</ref>\n\nThe three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)\n\n===Reforms during the 1960s===\n[[Konrad Adenauer]] was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker. However, he stayed in power for 14 years. The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged\u2014almost literally\u2014out of office in 1963.<ref>William Glenn Gray,  \"Adenauer, Erhard, and the Uses of Prosperity.\" ''German Politics and Society'' 25.2 (2007): 86-103.</ref>\n\n{{Main|Spiegel scandal}}\nIn October 1962 the weekly news magazine {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]}} published an analysis of the West German military defence. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of {{lang|de|Der Spiegel}} in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further. He announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963. His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.<ref>Alfred C. Mierzejewski, ''Ludwig Erhard: A Biography'' (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2005) p 179. [https://www.questia.com/library/120073119/ludwig-erhard-a-biography Online]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.\n\nA new coalition was formed to deal with this problem. Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. He led a [[grand coalition]] between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.\n\n[[File:Rudi.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]\nDuring the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|Notstand der Demokratie}} (\"Democracy in Crisis\") and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament.  A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the [[Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as {{lang|de|Jubelperser}}), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the [[Vietnam War|US intervention in Vietnam]], mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.<ref>Kraushaar, Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung, Vol. 2 Rogner und Bernhard, 1998 Dokument Nr. 193, p. 356</ref>\n\nIn the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the [[Nuremberg trials|War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg]] had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|{{lang|de|Auschwitz|nocat=y}} concentration camp]] and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that [[the Holocaust|the {{lang|he-Latn|Shoah|nocat=y}}]] was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term \"Holocaust\" for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when a 1978 [[Holocaust (miniseries)|American mini-series with that name]] was shown on West German television.)  The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.\n\nThe calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a [[Feminism in Germany|feminist movement]] in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.<ref>Reconciliation Policy in Germany 1998\u20132008, Construing the 'Problem' of the Incompatibility of Paid Employment and Care Work, by Cornelius Grebe; pg 92: ''\"However, the 1977 reform of marriage and family law by Social Democrats and Liberals formally gave women the right to take up employment without their spouses' permission.

In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt, they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the \"struggle against imperialism\".<ref>Kraushaar op.cit</ref>  The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the [[Maoist]]s and supporters of direct action in every form\u2014the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the [[Red Brigades]] ({{lang|de|Brigate Rosse}}), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the [[Red Army Faction]] which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name \"RAF\". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |title=RAF: Gefangen in der Geschichte |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508122346/http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Willy Brandt===\n{{main|Willy Brandt}}\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD\u2014headed by [[Willy Brandt]]\u2014gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.<ref>H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Miard-Delacroixm ''Willy Brandt: Life of a Statesman'' (2016)</ref> Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries.

Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Max Otte |author2=J\u00fcrgen Greve |year=2000 |title=A rising middle power?: German foreign policy in transformation, 1989\u20131999 }}</ref>  Mounting external problems forced Schmidt to concentrate on foreign policy and limited the domestic reforms that he could carry out.  The USSR upgraded its intermediate-range missiles, which  Schmidt complained was an unacceptable threat to the balance of nuclear power, because it increased  the likelihood of political coercion and  required a western response.  NATO respond in the form of its twin-track policy.

Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the [[German Green Party|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.\n\n===Reunification===\n{{Main|German reunification}}\n\nWith the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]; and [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|a final settlement of the post-war special status of Germany]]. Following democratic elections, East Germany declared its accession to the Federal Republic subject to the terms of the Unification Treaty between the two states; and then both West Germany and East Germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that Treaty's provisions. East Germany then dissolved itself, and its five post-war states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building|{{lang|de|Reichstag|nocat=y}} building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.\n\nHowever, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].\n\n==West German \"economic miracle\"==\nThe West German {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}} (\"economic miracle\", coined by ''[[The Times]]'' in 1950) was due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}  This improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the {{lang|de|[[Reichsmark]]}} with the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mark]]}} and halted rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038788-0006, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk, K\u00e4fer.jpg|thumb|The [[Volkswagen Beetle]]{{spaced ndash}}for many years the most successful car in the world{{spaced ndash}}on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973]]\n\nAs demand for consumer goods increased after World War II, the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of {{lang|de|[[Gastarbeiter]]}} (\"guest workers\") provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.<ref>[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519121934/https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=19 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\nWith the dropping of Allied reparations, the freeing of German intellectual property and the impact of the Marshall Plan stimulus, West Germany developed one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The fading miracle : four decades of market economy in Germany |last=Giersch, Herbert. |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-35351-3 |location=Cambridge [England] |oclc=24065456}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952 West Germany became part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]].

Four days after obtaining the \"authority of a sovereign state\" in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The UK and the USA retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the [[G8|Group of Six]] (G6).

reunification}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]], 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]\n\nThe official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of \"{{lang|de|Neue [[Ostpolitik]]}}\" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany as a whole.\n\nFollowing the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state.  By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|pages= 14]}}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and  agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 308}}</ref>\n: \"... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.\" <ref>{{citation|url=https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|title=Texas Law: Foreign Law Translations 1973|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152049/https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe West German Constitution ({{lang|de|Grundgesetz}}, \"Basic Law\") provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:\n\n* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).\n* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.\n\nAfter the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR and the re-establishment of {{lang|de|[[New states of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]}} on the territory of East Germany; and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had nominally declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.\n\nThe two German states entered into a [[monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the re-established [[New states of Germany|five East German {{lang|de|L\u00e4nder|nocat=y}}]] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.\n\n==Politics==\nPolitical life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949\u201363) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963\u201366) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966\u201369). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other right-wing parties.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, the [[Villa Hammerschmidt]] ]]\nKiesinger's 1966\u201369 \"Grand Coalition\" was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts\u2014the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].\n\nLeading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|[[Notstand der Demokratie]]}} (\"Democracy in a State of Emergency\") and the [[trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.\n\nBy 1968 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1970s [[environmentalism]] and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result, in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.\n\nAnother result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021 Kohl (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1987]]\nIn the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression<ref>[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901014759/http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html |date=1 September 2009 }} on 21 October 2002</ref><ref>Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen: ''Willy Brandt.

As Brandt himself later said, \"I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time\".<ref>quoted in: Gregor Sch\u00f6llgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113174538/http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all |date=13 January 2009 }} In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>\n\nFinance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD\u2013FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to \"the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA\".\n\nThe goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.\n\nIn January 1987 the Kohl\u2013Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.\n\n===Denazification===\n{{See also|Denazification|List of companies involved in the Holocaust}}\nIn 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany. West German President [[Walter Scheel]] and Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] were both former members of the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1957, 77% of the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|West German Ministry of Justice]]'s senior officials were former Nazi Party members.<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's post-war justice ministry was infested with Nazis protecting former comrades, study reveals |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 October 2016 |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223605/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |archive-date=23 January 2019 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Konrad Adenauer's State Secretary [[Hans Globke]] had played a major role in drafting anti-semitic [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] in Nazi Germany.<ref>Tetens, T.H.

Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Sport===\n[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] held in West Germany]]\n\nIn the 20th century, [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2\u20131 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAfter both [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1936]] had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called \"West German\" before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nAs of 2012, West Germany have played a record 43 matches at the European Championships.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=2013 Guinness World Records Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257 257]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257}}</ref>\n\n\n===Literary scene===\nBesides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the {{lang|de|[[Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur]]}}. [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] (and its  [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]]) soon developed into a regarded institution. Exemplary for West Germany's literature are \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Siegfried Lenz]] (with ''[[The German Lesson]]'') and [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] (with ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' and ''[[The Flounder]]'').\n\n==Geographical distribution of government==\n\nIn West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].\n\nThe West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts ({{lang|de|Bezirke}}), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states ({{lang|de|L\u00e4nder}}) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}}, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.\n\n==Present geographical and political terminology==\nToday, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[Western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the {{lang|de|Alte Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (old states) and the {{lang|de|Neue Bundesl\u00e4nder}} (new states), although {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} and {{lang|de|Ostdeutschland}} are still heard as well.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany}}\n* [[Economic history of the German reunification]]\n* [[Bonn\u2013Paris conventions]]\n* [[Petersberg Agreement]]\n* [[West Berlin]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bark, Dennis L., and David R.

Its design allows the vehicle to come into contention with large competitors in the C segment market of SUVs, which has been a prominent market in the past years.\n\nIt features [[Peugeot]]'s new iCockpit, which is an improved design compared to the current iCockpit featured in the [[Peugeot 208]], [[Peugeot 2008]] and [[Peugeot 308]]. The second generation was introduced on 23 May 2016.\n\nFeatures include an eight-inch touch screen to the centre console, a 12.3-inch customisable heads up display, and the small style steering wheel, which has become standard in all current models of [[Peugeot]].\n\nProduction started in 2016, with sales starting in January 2017. 100,000 orders were made in Europe between October 2016 and March 2017, half of them were made by people who did not own a Peugeot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2017/03/01/20005-20170301ARTFIG00318-peugeot-capitalise-sur-le-succes-du-nouveau-3008.php|title=Peugeot capitalise sur le succ\u00e8s du nouveau 3008|last=Egloff|first=Emmanuel|date=1 March 2017|work=Le Figaro|access-date=5 March 2017|language=fr-FR|issn=0182-5852}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Awards ==\n* [[European Car of the Year]] 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/winner/Peugeot/3008/2017_117/coty|title=Car of the Year 2017: Peugeot 3008, a winning formula \u2013 Car of the year|website=www.caroftheyear.org|access-date=6 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307045705/http://www.caroftheyear.org/winner/Peugeot/3008/2017_117/coty|archivedate=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n* ''[[Carbuyer|CarBuyer]]'' Car of the Year 2017<ref name=\"charterspeugeot.com\"/>\n* ''DieselCar Magazine'' Car of the Year 2017\n* ''DieselCar Magazine'' Best Medium SUV 2017\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Peugeot 3008}}\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101003141947/http://www.peugeot.co.uk/vehicles/peugeot-car-range/peugeot-3008/ Official UK 3008 website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110315083257/http://www.peugeot.co.uk/vehicles/peugeot-car-range/peugeot-3008-hybrid4/ Official 3008 HYbrid4 page]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIhe5HnOiHI Peugeot 3008 Active 2.0HDI Exterior and Interior in Full 3D HD]\n*[https://www.perthcitypeugeot.com.au/news/5-reasons-to-choose-the-award-winning-new-peugeot-3008-suv-in-2019/ Benefits Of The Peugeot 3008]\n\n{{Peugeot}}\n{{Peugeot timeline 1980 to date}}\n\n[[Category:Peugeot vehicles|3008]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2016]]\n[[Category:Compact sport utility vehicles]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars of China]]\n[[Category:Plug-in hybrid vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c6:e182:7800:1c3a:7804:c1ab:d2c4", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_3008"}
