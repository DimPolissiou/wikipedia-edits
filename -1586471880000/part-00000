The [[Poisson spot]] is not easily observed in every-day situations, so it was only natural for Poisson to interpret it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel's theory. However, the head of the committee, [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago]], and who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, decided to perform the experiment in more detail.

However, there is some uncertainty over the credit for the design; a note by Simpson claims exclusive credit, suggesting that Burnet and Tait only approved the final design.
