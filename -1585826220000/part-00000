Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval [[note head]] and a straight, flagless [[stem (music)|stem]]. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the [[musical staff|stave]] or downwards if it is on or above the middle line.

The storm quickly intensified, becoming a Category 1 typhoon just a day later. It further intensified into a Category 2 typhoon, passing very close to [[Taiwan]]. It weakened thereafter, making landfall near [[Zhoushan]] in East China on October 1 before weakening back to a poorly organized tropical storm.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans.

The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]].

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth.

Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness.

''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

For example the direction of helical growth in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).

Other questions are decided by a straightforward [[majority]]. Each member country has one vote.

Retrieved 12 July 2013.</ref> \n\nDuring the 1980s, the Assembly became a forum for the \"North-South dialogue:\" the discussion of issues between industrialized nations and developing countries. These issues came to the fore because of the phenomenal growth and changing makeup of the UN membership. In 1945, the UN had 51 members. It now has 193, of which more than two-thirds are [[developing country|developing countries]]. Because of their numbers, developing countries are often able to determine the agenda of the Assembly (using coordinating groups like the [[Group of 77|G77]]), the character of its debates, and the nature of its decisions. For many developing countries, the UN is the source of much of their diplomatic influence and the principal outlet for their foreign relations initiatives.\n\nAlthough the resolutions passed by the General Assembly do not have the binding forces over the member nations (apart from budgetary measures), pursuant to its [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|Uniting for Peace]] resolution of November 1950 (resolution 377 (V)), the Assembly may also take action if the Security Council fails to act, owing to the negative vote of a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]], in a case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression.

It can also reconvene for special and emergency special sessions. Its composition, functions, powers, voting, and procedures are set out in [[Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter]]. The first session was convened on 10 January 1946 in the [[Methodist Central Hall, Westminster|Methodist Central Hall]] in [[London]] and included representatives of 51 nations.\n\nVoting in the General Assembly on certain important questions, namely, recommendations on peace and security, budgetary concerns, and the election, admission, suspension or expulsion of members is by a [[Supermajority|two-thirds majority]] of those present and voting. Other questions are decided by a straightforward [[majority]]. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, including adoption of a scale of assessment, Assembly resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN, except matters of peace and security under Security Council consideration.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/background.shtml General Assembly of the United Nations]. United Nations. Retrieved 12 July 2013.</ref> \n\nDuring the 1980s, the Assembly became a forum for the \"North-South dialogue:\" the discussion of issues between industrialized nations and developing countries. These issues came to the fore because of the phenomenal growth and changing makeup of the UN membership. In 1945, the UN had 51 members. It now has 193, of which more than two-thirds are [[developing country|developing countries]]. Because of their numbers, developing countries are often able to determine the agenda of the Assembly (using coordinating groups like the [[Group of 77|G77]]), the character of its debates, and the nature of its decisions. For many developing countries, the UN is the source of much of their diplomatic influence and the principal outlet for their foreign relations initiatives.\n\nAlthough the resolutions passed by the General Assembly do not have the binding forces over the member nations (apart from budgetary measures), pursuant to its [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377|Uniting for Peace]] resolution of November 1950 (resolution 377 (V)), the Assembly may also take action if the Security Council fails to act, owing to the negative vote of a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]], in a case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression. The Assembly can consider the matter immediately with a view to making recommendations to Members for collective measures to maintain or restore international peace and security.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Methodist.central.hall.london.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Methodist Central Hall, Westminster|Methodist Central Hall]], London, the location of the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of United Nations 1941 \u2013 1950 |url=https://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/1941-1950.shtml |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312020304/http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/history/1941-1950.shtml |archivedate=12 March 2015  }}</ref>]]\n\nThe first session of the UN General Assembly was convened on 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall in [[London]] and included representatives of 51 nations.

It moved to the permanent [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] in New York City at the start of its seventh regular annual session, on 14 October 1952. In December 1988, in order to hear [[Yasser Arafat]], the General Assembly organized its 29th session in the [[Palace of Nations]], in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} \"Gen\u00e8ve renoue avec sa tradition de ville de paix\", ''[[Le Temps]]'', Thursday 16 January 2014.</ref>\n\n== Membership ==\n{{main|Member states of the United Nations}}\nAll 193 members of the United Nations are members of the General Assembly, with the addition of Holy See and Palestine as observer states.

After the session begins, the final agenda is adopted in a plenary meeting which allocates the work to the various Main Committees, who later submit reports back to the Assembly for adoption by consensus or by vote.\n\nItems on the agenda are numbered. Regular plenary sessions of the General Assembly in recent years have initially been scheduled to be held over the course of just three months; however, additional work loads have extended these sessions until just short of the next session. The routinely scheduled portions of the sessions normally commence on \"the Tuesday of the third week in September, counting from the first week that contains at least one working day\", per the UN Rules of Procedure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/about/ropga/sessions.shtml|title=General Assembly of the United Nations}}</ref> The last two of these Regular sessions were routinely scheduled to recess exactly three months afterwards<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/ga10859.doc.htm General Assembly Adopts Work Programme for Sixty-Fourth Session], UN General Assembly Adopts Work Programme for Sixty-Fourth Session</ref> in early December, but were resumed in January and extended until just before the beginning of the following sessions.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/ga/64/meetings/index.shtml#sep10 UN Plenary Meetings of the 64th Session of the UN General Assembly], General Assembly of the UN</ref>\n\n== Resolutions ==\n{{See also|United Nations General Assembly resolution|United Nations Document Codes}}\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in the United States 24 September 2009-5.jpg|thumb|Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] addresses the 64th session of the UN General Assembly on 24 September 2009]]\nThe General Assembly votes on many resolutions brought forth by sponsoring states.

Beginning in the Thirty-First Session, resolutions are numbered by individual session (for example Resolution 41/10 represents the 10th resolution adopted at the Forty-First Session).\n\n== Budget ==\nThe General Assembly also approves the budget of the United Nations and decides how much money each member state must pay to run the organization.<ref name=\"population\">[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?order=wbapi_data_value_2011+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc Population, total | Data | Table].

The Charter also addresses the non-payment of assessed contributions (Chapter IV, Article 19).\nThe planning, programming, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation cycle of the United Nations has evolved over the years; major resolutions on the process include General Assembly resolutions: 41/213 of 19 December 1986, 42/211 of 21 December 1987, and 45/248 of 21 December 1990.<ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/specrb.html#intro UN Security Council : Resolutions, Presidential Statements, Meeting Records, SC Press Releases] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202215845/http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/resguide/specrb.html#intro |date=2 December 2012 }}.

The scale of assessments is based on the capacity of countries to pay. This is determined by considering their relative shares of total gross national product, adjusted to take into account a number of factors, including their per capita incomes.\n\nIn addition to the regular budget, member states are assessed for the costs of the international tribunals and, in accordance with a modified version of the basic scale, for the costs of peacekeeping operations.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/hq/dm/budget.shtml United Nations Department of Management].

The Fourth Committee formerly handled Trusteeship and Decolonization matters. With the decreasing number of such matters to be addressed as the [[United Nations Trust Territories|trust territories]] attained independence and the [[decolonization]] movement progressed, the functions of the Special Political Committee were merged into the Fourth Committee during the 1990s.\n\nEach main committee consists of all the members of the General Assembly.

Annan recommended streamlining the General Assembly's agenda, committee structure, and procedures; strengthening the role and authority of its [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|president]]; enhancing the role of [[civil society]]; and establishing a mechanism to review the decisions of its committees, in order to minimize [[unfunded mandate]]s and [[micromanagement]] of the [[United Nations Secretariat]].

Instead, the Summit solely affirmed the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations, as well as the advisory role of the Assembly in the process of standard-setting and the codification of international law. The Summit also called for strengthening the relationship between the General Assembly and the other principal organs to ensure better coordination on topical issues that required coordinated action by the United Nations, in accordance with their respective mandates.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnstone|first=Ian|date=2008|title=Legislation and Adjudication in the UN Security Council: Bringing down the Deliberative Deficit|journal=American Journal of International Law|volume=Vol. 102.

These were managed via the \"People's committees\", organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country controlled by the communists, even limited arms industries were set up. At the very beginning, Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed and without any infrastructure. They had two major advantages over other military and paramilitary formations in former Yugoslavia:\n#A small but valuable cadre of [[Spanish Civil War]] veterans who, unlike anyone else at the time, had experience with modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those of World War II Yugoslavia\n#They were founded on ideology rather than [[ethnicity]], which meant the Partisans could expect at least some levels of support in any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations whose support was limited to territories with Croat or Serb majorities. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.\n\nOccupying and [[quisling]] forces, however, were quite aware of the Partisan threat, and attempted to destroy the resistance in what Yugoslav historiographers defined as seven major enemy offensives. These are:\n*The [[First Enemy Offensive]], the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"[[Republic of U\u017eice]]\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western [[Serbia]]. In November 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].<ref>[[#Roberts 1973|Roberts(1973)]], p. 37</ref> It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist [[Chetnik]] movement broke down and turned into open hostility.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 151\u2013155</ref>\n*The [[Second Enemy Offensive]], the coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].

There could be no half-measures; the Germans left nothing behind them but a trail of ruin. What in other circumstances might possibly have remained the purely ideological war that reactionaries abroad said it was (and German propaganda did their utmost to support them) became a war for national preservation.

The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the demise of the [[Chetniks]] and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, although supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. The new year would bring a change. The Germans were executing [[Operation Schwarz]] (the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when F.W.D.

The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had traveled from Russia by railway through Chetnik-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. All in all, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy. In September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]] was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near Drvar to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.<ref name=martin>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=David|title=Ally Betrayed: The Uncensored Story of Tito and Mihailovich|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|page=34|year=1946}}</ref>\n\nThus, after the [[Tehran Conference]] the Partisans received official recognition as the legitimate national liberation force by the Allies, who subsequently set up the [[RAF]] [[Balkan Air Force]] (under the influence and suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces. During a meeting with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] of 24 November 1943, [[Winston Churchill]] pointed out that:{{quote|It was a lamentable fact that virtually no supplies had been conveyed by sea to the 222,000 followers of Tito.&nbsp;...

For many Muslims, the behavior of these Serb Partisans towards them meant that there was little difference for them between the Partisans and Chetniks. However, in some areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina the Partisans were successful in attracting both Muslims and Croats from the beginning, notably in the [[Kozara (mountain)|Kozara]] Mountain area in north-west Bosnia and the [[Romanija]] Mountain area near Sarajevo.

This numerical dominance lessened later, but until 1943 Serbs formed a majority of Partisans in Croatia (including Dalmatia). Territories in Croatia proper with a substantial number of Serb inhabitants (Lika, Banija, Kordun) formed the most important source of manpower for the Partisans. In May 1941 the Ustasha regime ceded northern Dalmatia to Fascist Italy, which caused increasingly massive support for the Partisans among the Croats of Dalmatia. In other parts of Croatia Croat support toward the Partisans gradually increased due to Ustasha and Axis misrule, but much more slowly than in Dalmatia. There were only 1,492 Partisans from Serbia out of the 22,148 Partisans of Tito's Main Operational Group at the Battle of the River Sutjeska in June 1943, and 8,925 were from Croatia (of which 5,195 were from Dalmatia), but in ethnic terms, 11,851 were Serbs as against 5,220 Croats. At the end of 1943 all 13 Dalmatian Partisan brigades had a Croat majority, but among the 25 Partisan brigades from Croatian proper (without Dalmatia) only 7 had a Croat majority (17 had a Serb majority and one had a Czech majority).

The Partisan movement in Slovenia functioned as the military arm of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]], an Anti-Fascist resistance platform established in the [[Province of Ljubljana]] on 26 April 1941, which originally consisted of multiple groups of left wing orientation, most notable being Communist Party and Christian Socialists.

The plenum also functioned as Slovenian National Liberation Committee, the supreme authority in Slovenia. Some historians consider the Ko\u010devje Assembly to be the first Slovene elected parliament and Slovene Partisans as its representatives also participated on [[2nd session of the AVNOJ]] and were instrumental in adding the self-determination clause to the resolution on the establishment of a new federal Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front Plenum was renamed the [[SNOS|Slovenian National Liberation Council]] at the conference in \u010crnomelj on 19 February 1944 and transformed into the Slovenian parliament.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe Slovene Partisans retained their specific organizational structure and [[Slovene language]] as the commanding language until the last months of World War II, when their language was removed as the commanding language.

These were transported across Slovenia, from where many were airlifted from [[Semi\u010d]], while others made the longer overland trek down through Croatia for a boat passage to [[Bari]] in Italy. In the spring of 1944, the British military mission in Slovenia reported that there was a \"steady, slow trickle\" of escapes from these camps. They were being assisted by local civilians, and on contacting Partisans on the general line of the River [[Drava]], they were able to make their way to safety with Partisan guides.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Raid at O\u017ebalt===\n{{Main|Raid at O\u017ebalt}}\nA total of 132 Allied prisoners of war were rescued from the Germans by the Partisans in a single operation in August 1944 in what is known as the [[Raid at O\u017ebalt]]. In June 1944, the Allied escape organization began to take an active interest in assisting prisoners from camps in southern Austria and evacuating them through Yugoslavia. A post of the Allied mission in northern [[Slovenia]] had found that at [[O\u017ebalt]], just on the Austrian side of the border, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Maribor]], there was a poorly guarded working camp from which a raid by [[Slovene Partisans]] could free all the prisoners. Over 100 POWs were transported from [[Stalag XVIII-D]] at [[Maribor]] to O\u017ebalt each morning to do railway maintenance work, and returned to their quarters in the evening. Contact was made between Partisans and the prisoners with the result that at the end of August a group of seven slipped away past a sleeping guard at 15:00, and at 21:00 the men were celebrating with the Partisans in a village, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} away on the Yugoslav side of the border.<ref name=mason>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Walter W.|last2=Kippenberger|first2=Howard K.|title= Prisoners of War|publisher=Historical Publications Branch|page=383|year=1954}}</ref>\n\nThe seven escapees arranged with the Partisans for the rest of the camp to be freed the following day. Next morning, the seven returned with about a hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work-party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans, to quote a New Zealand eye-witness, \"swooped down the hillside and disarmed the eighteen guards\". In a short time prisoners, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted along the route used by the first seven prisoners the previous evening. At the first headquarters camp reached, details were taken of the total of 132 escaped prisoners for transmission by radio to England. Progress along the evacuation route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused the loss of two prisoners and two of the escort. Eventually they reached [[Semi\u010d]], in [[White Carniola]], Slovenia, which was a Partisan base catering for POWs. They were flown across to [[Bari]] on 21 September 1944 from the airport of [[Otok, Metlika|Otok]] near [[Gradac, Metlika|Gradac]].<ref name=mason/>\n\n==Post-war==\n{{Main|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nSFR Yugoslavia was one of only two European countries that were largely liberated by its own forces during World War II. It received significant assistance from the Soviet Union during the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of Serbia]], and substantial assistance from the [[Balkan Air Force]] from mid-1944, but only limited assistance, mainly from the British, prior to 1944. At the end of the war no foreign troops were stationed on its soil. Partly as a result, the country found itself halfway between the two camps at the onset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nIn 1947\u201348, the Soviet Union attempted to command obedience from Yugoslavia, primarily on issues of foreign policy, which resulted in the [[Tito-Stalin split]] and almost ignited an armed conflict. A period of very cool relations with the Soviet Union followed, during which the U.S. and the UK considered courting Yugoslavia into the newly formed [[NATO]]. This however changed in 1953 with the Trieste crisis, a tense dispute between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies over the eventual Yugoslav-Italian border (see [[Free Territory of Trieste]]), and with Yugoslav-Soviet reconciliation in 1956. This ambivalent position at the start of the Cold War matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] foreign policy which Yugoslavia actively espoused until its dissolution.\n\n===Atrocities===\nA number of Partisan units, and the local population in some areas, engaged in [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Yugoslavia|mass murder]] in the immediate postwar period against [[POW]]s and other perceived Axis sympathizers, collaborators, and/or fascists along with their relatives, including children. These infamous massacres include the [[Foibe massacres]], [[Tezno massacre]], [[Macelj massacre]], [[Ko\u010devski Rog massacre]], [[Barbara Pit massacre]] and the [[communist purges in Serbia in 1944\u201345]].\n\nThe [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriations at Bleiburg]] (although scholars disagree on how many people died and no number has been officially recognized or agreed upon) of retreating columns of [[Chetnik]] and [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops, and soldiers of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] and thousands of civilians heading or retreating towards Austria to surrender to western Allied forces, have been called a \"massacre\". The \"foibe massacres\" draw their name from the \"foibe\" pits in which Croatian Partisans of the [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] (often along with groups of angry civilian locals) shot Italian fascists, and suspected collaborationists and/or separatists. According to a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm|title=Slovene-Italian historical commission|publisher=Kozina.com|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> established in 1993, which investigated only on what happened in places included in present-day Italy and Slovenia, the killings seemed to proceed from endeavors to remove persons linked with fascism (regardless of their personal responsibility), and endeavors to carry out mass executions of real, potential or only alleged opponents of the Communist government. The [[1944-1945 killings in Ba\u010dka]] were similar in nature and entailed the killing of suspected Hungarian, German and Serbian fascists, and their suspected affiliates, without regard to their personal responsibility. During this purge, a large number of civilians from the associated ethnic group were also killed.<ref>M\u00e1rton Matuska. ''Days of Revenge''.

Throughout the war the Partisans used any weapons they could find, mostly weapons captured from the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]], [[Royal Italian Army|Italians]], [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Army of the NDH]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and the [[Chetniks]], such as the [[Karabiner 98k]] rifle, [[MP 40]] submachine gun, [[MG 34]] machine gun, [[Carcano]] rifles and carbines and [[Beretta]] submachine guns. The other way that the Partisans acquired weapons was from supplies given to them by the [[Soviet Union]] and the United Kingdom, including the [[PPSh-41]] and the [[Sten]] MKII submachine guns respectively. Additionally, Partisan workshops created their own weapons modelled on factory-made weapons already in use, including the so-called \"[[Partisan rifle]]\" and the anti-tank \"[[Partisan mortar]]\".\n\n==Women==\n[[File:Kozar\u010danka - Milja Marin.jpg|thumb|''[[Kozar\u010danka]]'' by \u017dor\u017e Skrigin (winter 1943\u201344)]]\nThe Yugoslav Partisans mobilized many women.<ref name=\"Batini\u0107History2009\">{{cite book|author1=Jelena Batini\u0107|author2=Stanford University.

This last official name is the full name most associated with the Partisans, and reflects the fact that the proletarian brigades and other mobile units were organized into the National Liberation Army (''Narodnooslobodila\u010dka vojska''). The name change also reflects the fact that the latter superseded in importance the partisan detachments themselves.\n\nShortly before the end of the war, in March 1945, all resistance forces were reorganized into the regular armed force of Yugoslavia and renamed Yugoslav Army.

In 1942, although supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. The new year would bring a change.

The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain]] and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had traveled from Russia by railway through Chetnik-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity.

During a meeting with [[Franklin D.

In early 1943 Partisans took steps to establish [[ZAVNOH]] (National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia) to act as a parliamentary body for all of Croatia \u2013 the only one of its kind in occupied Europe. ZAVNOH held three plenary sessions during the war in areas which remained surrounded by Axis troops. At its fourth and last session, held on 24\u201325 July 1945 in Zagreb, ZAVNOH proclaimed itself as the Croatian Parliament or [[Sabor]].<ref name=Jelic>{{cite book|last1=Jelic|first1=Ivan| title=Croatia in War and Revolution 1941\u20131945|publisher=[[Zagreb: \u0160kolska knjiga]]|year=1978}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1941 in the territory of the puppet Croatian State Serbs comprised approximately one-third of the population but about 95% of all Partisans. This numerical dominance lessened later, but until 1943 Serbs formed a majority of Partisans in Croatia (including Dalmatia). Territories in Croatia proper with a substantial number of Serb inhabitants (Lika, Banija, Kordun) formed the most important source of manpower for the Partisans. In May 1941 the Ustasha regime ceded northern Dalmatia to Fascist Italy, which caused increasingly massive support for the Partisans among the Croats of Dalmatia. In other parts of Croatia Croat support toward the Partisans gradually increased due to Ustasha and Axis misrule, but much more slowly than in Dalmatia. There were only 1,492 Partisans from Serbia out of the 22,148 Partisans of Tito's Main Operational Group at the Battle of the River Sutjeska in June 1943, and 8,925 were from Croatia (of which 5,195 were from Dalmatia), but in ethnic terms, 11,851 were Serbs as against 5,220 Croats. At the end of 1943 all 13 Dalmatian Partisan brigades had a Croat majority, but among the 25 Partisan brigades from Croatian proper (without Dalmatia) only 7 had a Croat majority (17 had a Serb majority and one had a Czech majority).

The Partisan movement in Slovenia functioned as the military arm of the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]], an Anti-Fascist resistance platform established in the [[Province of Ljubljana]] on 26 April 1941, which originally consisted of multiple groups of left wing orientation, most notable being Communist Party and Christian Socialists. During the course of the war, the influence of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] started to grow, until its supremacy was officially sanctioned in the [[Dolomiti Declaration]] of 1 March 1943.<ref name=\"Gow2010-48\">{{cite book |title=Slovenia and the Slovenes: A Small State in the New Europe|last=Gow|first=James|author2=Carmichael, Cathie|edition=Revised and updated|year=2010|publisher=Hurst Publishers Ltd|isbn=978-1-85065-944-0|page=48}}</ref> Some of the members of Liberation Front and partisans were ex-members of the [[TIGR]] resistance movement.\n\nRepresentatives of all political groups in Liberation Front participated in Supreme Plenum of Liberation Front, which led the resistance efforts in Slovenia. Supreme Plenum was active until 3 October 1943 when, at the [[Ko\u010devski zbor|Assembly of the Slovenian Nation's Delegates]] in Ko\u010devje, the 120-member Liberation Front Plenum was elected as the supreme body of the Slovenian Liberation Front. The plenum also functioned as Slovenian National Liberation Committee, the supreme authority in Slovenia. Some historians consider the Ko\u010devje Assembly to be the first Slovene elected parliament and Slovene Partisans as its representatives also participated on [[2nd session of the AVNOJ]] and were instrumental in adding the self-determination clause to the resolution on the establishment of a new federal Yugoslavia. The Liberation Front Plenum was renamed the [[SNOS|Slovenian National Liberation Council]] at the conference in \u010crnomelj on 19 February 1944 and transformed into the Slovenian parliament.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe Slovene Partisans retained their specific organizational structure and [[Slovene language]] as the commanding language until the last months of World War II, when their language was removed as the commanding language.

For example, between 1 January and 15 October 1944, according to statistics compiled by the US Air Force Air Crew Rescue Unit, 1,152 American airmen were airlifted from Yugoslavia, 795 with Partisan assistance and 356 with the help of the Chetniks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leary|first=William Matthew|title=Fueling the Fires of Resistance: Army Air Forces Special Operations in the Balkans during World War II|year=1995|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-061364-7|page=34}}</ref> Yugoslav Partisans in Slovene territory rescued 303 American airmen, 389 British airmen and prisoners of war, and 120 French and other prisoners of war and slave laborers.<ref>[[#refTomasevich2001|Tomasevich 2001]], p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe Partisans also assisted hundreds of Allied soldiers who succeeded in escaping from German POW camps (mostly in southern Austria) throughout the war, but especially from 1943\u201345. These were transported across Slovenia, from where many were airlifted from [[Semi\u010d]], while others made the longer overland trek down through Croatia for a boat passage to [[Bari]] in Italy. In the spring of 1944, the British military mission in Slovenia reported that there was a \"steady, slow trickle\" of escapes from these camps. They were being assisted by local civilians, and on contacting Partisans on the general line of the River [[Drava]], they were able to make their way to safety with Partisan guides.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Raid at O\u017ebalt===\n{{Main|Raid at O\u017ebalt}}\nA total of 132 Allied prisoners of war were rescued from the Germans by the Partisans in a single operation in August 1944 in what is known as the [[Raid at O\u017ebalt]]. In June 1944, the Allied escape organization began to take an active interest in assisting prisoners from camps in southern Austria and evacuating them through Yugoslavia. A post of the Allied mission in northern [[Slovenia]] had found that at [[O\u017ebalt]], just on the Austrian side of the border, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Maribor]], there was a poorly guarded working camp from which a raid by [[Slovene Partisans]] could free all the prisoners. Over 100 POWs were transported from [[Stalag XVIII-D]] at [[Maribor]] to O\u017ebalt each morning to do railway maintenance work, and returned to their quarters in the evening. Contact was made between Partisans and the prisoners with the result that at the end of August a group of seven slipped away past a sleeping guard at 15:00, and at 21:00 the men were celebrating with the Partisans in a village, {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} away on the Yugoslav side of the border.<ref name=mason>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Walter W.|last2=Kippenberger|first2=Howard K.|title= Prisoners of War|publisher=Historical Publications Branch|page=383|year=1954}}</ref>\n\nThe seven escapees arranged with the Partisans for the rest of the camp to be freed the following day. Next morning, the seven returned with about a hundred Partisans to await the arrival of the work-party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans, to quote a New Zealand eye-witness, \"swooped down the hillside and disarmed the eighteen guards\". In a short time prisoners, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted along the route used by the first seven prisoners the previous evening. At the first headquarters camp reached, details were taken of the total of 132 escaped prisoners for transmission by radio to England. Progress along the evacuation route south was difficult, as German patrols were very active. A night ambush by one such patrol caused the loss of two prisoners and two of the escort. Eventually they reached [[Semi\u010d]], in [[White Carniola]], Slovenia, which was a Partisan base catering for POWs. They were flown across to [[Bari]] on 21 September 1944 from the airport of [[Otok, Metlika|Otok]] near [[Gradac, Metlika|Gradac]].<ref name=mason/>\n\n==Post-war==\n{{Main|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nSFR Yugoslavia was one of only two European countries that were largely liberated by its own forces during World War II. It received significant assistance from the Soviet Union during the [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of Serbia]], and substantial assistance from the [[Balkan Air Force]] from mid-1944, but only limited assistance, mainly from the British, prior to 1944. At the end of the war no foreign troops were stationed on its soil. Partly as a result, the country found itself halfway between the two camps at the onset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nIn 1947\u201348, the Soviet Union attempted to command obedience from Yugoslavia, primarily on issues of foreign policy, which resulted in the [[Tito-Stalin split]] and almost ignited an armed conflict. A period of very cool relations with the Soviet Union followed, during which the U.S. and the UK considered courting Yugoslavia into the newly formed [[NATO]]. This however changed in 1953 with the Trieste crisis, a tense dispute between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies over the eventual Yugoslav-Italian border (see [[Free Territory of Trieste]]), and with Yugoslav-Soviet reconciliation in 1956. This ambivalent position at the start of the Cold War matured into the [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] foreign policy which Yugoslavia actively espoused until its dissolution.\n\n===Atrocities===\nA number of Partisan units, and the local population in some areas, engaged in [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Yugoslavia|mass murder]] in the immediate postwar period against [[POW]]s and other perceived Axis sympathizers, collaborators, and/or fascists along with their relatives, including children. These infamous massacres include the [[Foibe massacres]], [[Tezno massacre]], [[Macelj massacre]], [[Ko\u010devski Rog massacre]], [[Barbara Pit massacre]] and the [[communist purges in Serbia in 1944\u201345]].\n\nThe [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriations at Bleiburg]] (although scholars disagree on how many people died and no number has been officially recognized or agreed upon) of retreating columns of [[Chetnik]] and [[Slovene Home Guard]] troops, and soldiers of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] and thousands of civilians heading or retreating towards Austria to surrender to western Allied forces, have been called a \"massacre\". The \"foibe massacres\" draw their name from the \"foibe\" pits in which Croatian Partisans of the [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] (often along with groups of angry civilian locals) shot Italian fascists, and suspected collaborationists and/or separatists. According to a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm|title=Slovene-Italian historical commission|publisher=Kozina.com|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> established in 1993, which investigated only on what happened in places included in present-day Italy and Slovenia, the killings seemed to proceed from endeavors to remove persons linked with fascism (regardless of their personal responsibility), and endeavors to carry out mass executions of real, potential or only alleged opponents of the Communist government. The [[1944-1945 killings in Ba\u010dka]] were similar in nature and entailed the killing of suspected Hungarian, German and Serbian fascists, and their suspected affiliates, without regard to their personal responsibility. During this purge, a large number of civilians from the associated ethnic group were also killed.<ref>M\u00e1rton Matuska. ''Days of Revenge''. Forum Publisher, Novi Sad, 1991.<!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--></ref>{{pn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Partisans did not have an official agenda of liquidating their enemies and their cardinal ideal was the \"[[brotherhood and unity]]\" of all Yugoslav nations (the phrase became the motto for the new Yugoslavia). The country suffered between 900,000 and 1,150,000 civilian and military dead during the Axis occupation.<ref>[[#Tomasevich 2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 737</ref> Between 80,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the partisan purges and at least 30,000 people were killed in the Bleiburg killings, according to Marcus Tanner in his work, ''Croatia: a Nation Forged in War''.\n\nThis chapter of Partisan history was a taboo subject for conversation in the [[SFR Yugoslavia]] until the late 1980s, and as a result, decades of official silence created a reaction in the form of numerous data manipulation for nationalist propaganda purposes.<ref name=macdonald>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=David B.|title=Balkan Holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian Victim Centred Propaganda and the War in Yugoslavia|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7190-6467-8}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe first small arms for the Partisans were acquired from the defeated [[Royal Yugoslav Army]], like the [[M24 series|M24 Mauser rifle]]. Throughout the war the Partisans used any weapons they could find, mostly weapons captured from the [[Wehrmacht|Germans]], [[Royal Italian Army|Italians]], [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Army of the NDH]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and the [[Chetniks]], such as the [[Karabiner 98k]] rifle, [[MP 40]] submachine gun, [[MG 34]] machine gun, [[Carcano]] rifles and carbines and [[Beretta]] submachine guns. The other way that the Partisans acquired weapons was from supplies given to them by the [[Soviet Union]] and the United Kingdom, including the [[PPSh-41]] and the [[Sten]] MKII submachine guns respectively.
