His legacy include the ''Mother And Child'' bronze sculpture outside Far East Shopping Centre along Orchard Road, and ''The Explorer'' located at the entrance of the [[Singapore Art Museum]]\n\nBorn in Singapore, Ng first showed sculpting talent as a child, playing with plasticine and creating figures for fun during classes in primary school. After graduating from Senior Cambridge examinations in 1955, he took painting and sculpture classes at the [[British Council]], and with artist [[Liu Kang (artist)|Liu Kang]] in 1958. Ng entered the [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] in that year and showed promise as an aspiring artist, experimenting with art in various media while other students were merely following through the curriculum. In 1959 the young Ng met British sculptor [[Jean Bullock]] in Singapore, who exposed him to sculpture art and introduced him to ciment fondu, a relatively new sculpting medium.<ref name=\"Elements\">{{Cite document|title='Dr. Ng Eng Teng (1934 - 2001)', The Three Elements : Stone, Wood, Clay : 5th Ngee Ann Exhibition|publisher=Ngee Ann Cultural Centre|year=2008|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nAt the Academy, his potential also caught the eye of teacher and artist [[Georgette Chen]], and often invited him to her home to discuss about art aesthetics. Whenever he visited her place his attention would fall on the ceramic pieces displayed at her home. It dawned upon Chen that since there were no sculptors in Singapore at that time, Ng's gift with clay and fluency with the English Language, should see him with a great future as a sculptor. She urged him not only to study plastic arts at [[The Potteries]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in [[England]], she also thought Ng should go to [[St Ives, Cornwall|St. Ives]] and seek out ceramic artist [[Bernard Leach]] at his studio. Chen deeply admired Leach and his works.<ref name=\"first\">{{cite book|last=Eng Teng|first=Ng|title= Sculpture, ceramic, painting: Ng Eng Teng one-man art exhibition (catalogue)|year=1970}}</ref>\n\nNg took heed of her suggestions and left Singapore for [[The Potteries]] in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in 1962 upon graduating the Academy. He had read pottery design at the North Staffordshire College of Technology / Stoke-on-Trent College of Art between 1962 and 1963, and with the [[Farnham School of Art]] in [[Surrey]], where Ng had spent a year as a research student of ceramics and sculpture in 1964.<ref name=\"first\"/> He worked with the [[Carrigaline Pottery]] in [[County Cork]] as a designer of tiles, [[Holloware|hollow-ware]] and [[tableware]] after his graduation from Farnham. His commercial designs were exhibited at the Arts and Crafts Centre of Britain and at various Spring Fairs. Ng was beginning to make a name for himself in the commercial industry, and was even featured in [[The Irish Press]] when his designer products became popular with the local market.<ref name=\"Olympics\">{{Cite document|last=Tay|first=Marie Ann|title=The sculptor who went to the Olympics|publisher=Singapore Tatler|date=December 1988|pages=89\u201391|postscrjejkwipt=<!--None-->}}</ref> In 1966, Ng was also awarded with a Diploma by the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers (MSIAD) (now known as the [[Chartered Society of Designers]]).<ref name=\"first\"/> But Ng increasingly felt that life in Cork was getting too comfortable, and the work he did was more craft than art. He decided to return home to Singapore to pursue his passion in artistic sculpting.<ref name=\"Olympics\"/>\n\nNg returned to Singapore mainly for three reasons: one was to set up a workshop and embark his ceramic practice teaching pottery-making. The second was due to his concerns for his family and wanting to provide support to them. The third reason was to heed [[Georgette Chen|Georgette's]] plea to her students to come back to help [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts|their alma mater, the Academy]], and in Ng's mind he thought that he could start a pottery workshop in the Academy - only to find his suggestion rejected by the Academy administration. Ng started his workshop with the help of his father, and  first designed a series of works created using slip casting and press moulding, and hoped they can make some money but it was not successful. His financial resources depleted soon and Ng decided to seek employment. Through the recommendation of fellow artist Vincent Hoisington, he found employment with the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]].<ref name=\"thoughts\">{{cite book|last=T.

The 5-day exhibition was officially opened by the Minister of State for Labour Mr Sia Kah Hui, and jointly sponsored by Singapore Art Society, [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] and the Society of Chinese Artists. Ng went on to have an illustrious career, becoming a renowned sculptor known in many parts of Asia and Australia and in 1981, his outstanding achievements and contributions to the Singapore art scene have garnered him the [[Cultural Medallion]] Award.<ref name=\"first\"/>\n\n[[File:NgEngTengPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|'''Portrait (1988)'''<br>'''Size: '''unknown<br>'''Medium: '''Ciment fondu<br>'''Collection: '''Olympic Park, [[Seoul]], [[Korea]]]]\n\nIn 1988, Ng received a visit by the director of the Paris Arts Centre representing the Olympic Selection Committee, at his studio one evening. He had requested a commission from Ng, to create a 3-metre sculpture piece for the [[Seoul Olympics]] and to have it completed within one month. Though Ng resisted the idea at first, the director convinced him to give precedence to his commission than to meet his own exhibition schedule. Eventually both parties agreed on replicating the model piece entitled ''Portrait'' from his studio. This piece not only could be easily replicated within the given time frame, it carried a humanistic message that was apt for the people in Korea during the tumultuous period prior to the Olympics.<ref name=\"Olympics\"/>\n\nOn February 16, 2001 Ng was presented with the [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]] de la Culture Arts Patronage Award at a dinner ceremony held at the Singapore Art Museum. He was given a commemorative Montblanc pen and a cheque for Euro 15,000 (S$23,800) to be given to an arts project of his choice. This award was handed to Ng for his generous donation of 933 of his paintings, drawings, sculptures, maquettes and ceramics to the [[National University of Singapore]] on two separate occasions - the first donation of 760 works made in 1997, followed by another 173 pieces in 1998.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes. Multipliers are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x (a second-prize Megaplier play can win $5 million cash.) The Megaplier is not available in California, or on ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers (where offered.)<ref>http://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play</ref>\n\n== Current Mega Millions members ==\n[[File:stateswithlotto.png|thumb|400px|As of January 30, 2020, Mega Millions is available in 45 states and the [[District of Columbia]] (''in blue''), plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ''(not shown)''.]]\n\nMega Millions replaced ''The Big Game'' in 2002 (see below for the evolution of the name ''Mega Millions'').\n\n== Mega Millions and Powerball ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Lottery \n!Powerball\n!Mega Millions\n|-\n|[[Arizona Lottery|Arizona]]\n|{{dts|April 4, 1994}}\n|{{dts|April 18, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]]\n|{{dts|October 31, 2009}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[California State Lottery|California]]\n|{{dts|April 8, 2013}}\n|{{dts|June 22, 2005}}\n|-\n|[[Connecticut Lottery|Connecticut]]\n|{{dts|November 28, 1995}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Colorado Lottery|Colorado]]\n|{{dts|August 2, 2001}}\n|{{dts|May 16, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]]\n|{{dts|January 14, 1991}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[D.C.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n== ''The Big Game Mega Millions'' ==\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n== October 2013 format change ==\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n== October 2017 format/price point change ==\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\n== \"Just the Jackpot\" option ==\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, but Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n== April 2020 format change ==\nHowever in the new version regulations (which began on Saturday April 4, 2020 with the first drawing on Tuesday April 7, 2020) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] is $20&nbsp;million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing based upon sales the sales of everywhere;percent each year (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by lotteries on cash/annuity choice regulations.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner. So far, we haven't have a Mega Millions jackpot winning ticket yet. At any time and/or once we do have a Mega Millions jackpot winning ticket, then this game will reset back down to $20 million dollars!\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective April 4, 2020 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot to $20 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThis response is regarding the Corona Virus issue. The new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lottery.net/news/mega-millions-eliminates-minimum-starting-jackpot|title=Mega Millions Eliminates Minimum Starting Jackpot|last=Lottery.net|website=Lottery.net|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Record jackpots ==\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina.

The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher.

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes. Multipliers are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x (a second-prize Megaplier play can win $5 million cash.) The Megaplier is not available in California, or on ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers (where offered.)<ref>http://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play</ref>\n\n== Current Mega Millions members ==\n[[File:stateswithlotto.png|thumb|400px|As of January 30, 2020, Mega Millions is available in 45 states and the [[District of Columbia]] (''in blue''), plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ''(not shown)''.]]\n\nMega Millions replaced ''The Big Game'' in 2002 (see below for the evolution of the name ''Mega Millions'').\n\n== Mega Millions and Powerball ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Lottery \n!Powerball\n!Mega Millions\n|-\n|[[Arizona Lottery|Arizona]]\n|{{dts|April 4, 1994}}\n|{{dts|April 18, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]]\n|{{dts|October 31, 2009}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[California State Lottery|California]]\n|{{dts|April 8, 2013}}\n|{{dts|June 22, 2005}}\n|-\n|[[Connecticut Lottery|Connecticut]]\n|{{dts|November 28, 1995}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Colorado Lottery|Colorado]]\n|{{dts|August 2, 2001}}\n|{{dts|May 16, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]]\n|{{dts|January 14, 1991}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[D.C.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n== ''The Big Game Mega Millions'' ==\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million. They chose the cash option, splitting $175 million before federal withholdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1 |title=California's First Mega Millions Jackpot Winners The Lucky Seven -- Claim Prize |publisher=Mega Millions |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121134302/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1|archivedate=2013-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp |title=Mega Millions Jackpot History |publisher=Megamillions.com |date= 2013-09-29|accessdate=2013-12-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929051737/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp| archivedate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> which was then the record for the third largest jackpot in U.S. history.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n== October 2013 format change ==\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n== October 2017 format/price point change ==\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\n== \"Just the Jackpot\" option ==\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, but Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n== April 2020 format change ==\nHowever in the new version regulations (which began on Saturday April 4, 2020 with the first drawing on Tuesday April 7, 2020) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] is $20&nbsp;million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing based upon sales the sales of everywhere;percent each year (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by lotteries on cash/annuity choice regulations.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner. So far, we haven't have a Mega Millions jackpot winning ticket yet. At any time and/or once we do have a Mega Millions jackpot winning ticket, then this game will reset back down to $20 million dollars!\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective April 5, 2020 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot to $20 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThis response is regarding the Corona Virus issue.

The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher.

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Individually, the five white balls, several seconds apart, drop through a hole in the bottom of the mixing drum.\n\n== Record jackpots (listed by ''cash value'') ==\n{{see also|Lottery jackpot records}}\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|Cash value (in millions USD)\n|Annuity value (in millions USD)\n!Drawing date\n!Winner(s)\n!Description\n|-\n|$878\n|$1,537\n|October 23, 2018<ref name=cbcnews2018 />\n|1 [[South Carolina Education Lottery|SC]]\n|World's largest jackpot (cash or annuity)\n|-\n|$474\n|$656\n|March 30, 2012\n|3 ([[Maryland Lottery|MD]], [[Kansas Lottery|KS]], [[Illinois|IL]])\n|World's third largest jackpot (cash or annuity)\n|-\n|$347.7<ref name=MM648MClaimAtlanta/>\n|$648<ref name=MM648M />\n|December 17, 2013\n|2 ([[California Lottery|CA]], [[Georgia Lottery|GA]])\n|Second-largest annuity value\n|-\n|$320\n|$543\n|July 24, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/group-of-co-workers-are-winners-of-543-million-mega-millions-jackpot.html|title=A group of 11 co-workers are the winners of a $543 million Mega Millions jackpot.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the [[River Lossie]] on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and serves the community to this day.  Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a [[royal burgh]] in the 12th century by King [[David I of Scotland]], and by that time had a castle on top of the present day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The people of Elgin are collectively known as Elginites. The origin of the name Elgin is likely to be Celtic, it may derive from 'Aille' literally signifying beauty, but in topography a beautiful place or valley<ref>The Place names of Elginshire by Donald Matheson. Pg.139</ref>. Another possibility is 'ealg', meaning both 'Ireland' and 'worthy'<ref>Mackay, George, 2000. Scottish Place Names</ref>. The termination 'gin' or 'in' are Celtic endings signifying little or diminutive forms, hence Elgin could mean beautiful place, worthy place or little Ireland.\n==History==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn August 1040, [[Macbeth of Scotland|MacBeth's]] army defeated and killed [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart.<ref>Burgh Records of Scotland, Vol I, Preface, p.35</ref> David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]]. During David's reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] in 1224 when he granted the land for a new [[cathedral]] to Andrew, [[Bishop of Moray]]. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]]. Elgin was a popular residence for the early [[Scotland|Scottish]] monarchs: [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[William I of Scotland|William I]], [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.\n\nOf these kings, Alexander II was Elgin's greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Blackfriars on the west side and the [[Franciscans]] or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.<ref>Mackintosh, Herbert B: Elgin Past and Present, Elgin, 1914 p. 44</ref>\n[[File:Scotland Elgin Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Elgin Cathedral]]\nOn 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new [[Elgin Cathedral]] was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as \"Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom\".\n\n[[Edward I of England]] travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the [[Cotton library]] now held in the [[British Library]] is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as \"bon chastell et bonne ville\" \u2014 good castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle's wooden interior had been burned while held by the [[England|English]] governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at [[Kinloss Abbey]] from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland's cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to [[Orkney]], then to [[Norway]], only to return after Robert Bruce's victories against the English. After Edward's death in July 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] retook Scotland in 1308, [[slighting]] castles to keep them out of English hands. David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray at the head of his army, joined with Bruce and they slighted the castles of [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]] and [[Forres]] before seizing and slighting Kinneddar Castle, which also housed English soldiers. He attacked Elgin castle to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding.\n\nIn August 1370 [[Alexander Bur]], [[Bishop of Moray]] began payments to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], Wolf of Badenoch, [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III's]] brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by \"wyld, wykked Heland-men\". The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.\n\n===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===\n[[File:Elgin cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Elgin Cathedral]]\nThe citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]]. The lead was to be sold and the proceeds to go to the maintenance of Regent Moray's soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to [[Holland]] sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and [[Clan Brodie#17th century and Civil War|Alexander Brodie of Brodie]], all ardent [[Covenanters]], removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper's house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. John was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities, it is now in Elgin Museum, he is also honoured with a large tombstone in the eastern Cathedral precincts.\n\nWhen [[Daniel Defoe]] toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:<blockquote>In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim'd it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur'd miles [725&nbsp;km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Defoe1727\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Divided Into Circuits Or Journies.

When Bishop Bur wrote to [[King Robert III]], complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King's brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as \"the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.\" Chambers, in his ''Picture of Scotland'', says: <blockquote>It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.</blockquote>Lachlan Shaw in his ''History of the Province of Moray'' was equally impressed when he wrote<blockquote>the church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.</blockquote>\n\n[[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king's army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs. Anderson, a passionate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], one of the Prince's generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: <blockquote>Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you'll write to Mr. Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can ...</blockquote>\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Dr Grays Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dr Grays Hospital]]\nIn the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of [[Freemasons]], at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr. Gray's Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr. Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], endowed \u00a326,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of \u00a310,000. Lt. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed \u00a370,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institute was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and 10 elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum in 1842 and the County Buildings in 1866.\n\nThe [[Morayshire Railway]] was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and [[Lossiemouth]] on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only  {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway's return to solvency from crippling debt. The railway and Lossiemouth harbour became very important to Elgin's economy.\n\nThe town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper. It was not until the 20th century, however, that the separate villages of Bishopmill and New Elgin would be incorporated into the town.\n\nThe [[Cooper Park drill hall, Elgin|Cooper Park drill hall]] was completed in 1908.<ref name=canmore>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/331416/elgin-cooper-park-drill-hall|title=Elgin, Cooper Park, Drill Hall|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south.\n[[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]] rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of [[aeolian sandstone]] formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town's edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie's Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the [[Elgin Reptiles]]. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin's town center, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Elgin Panorama 01.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Elgin from the northern spire of [[Elgin Cathedral]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\nElgin's climate is [[temperate]] [[Maritime climate|maritime]], with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the [[rain shadow]] of mountains to the west and southwest.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Elgin, elevation: {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981-2010

civilians. In 2005, [[RAF Lossiemouth]] along with its neighbour [[RAF Kinloss]] contributed \u00a3156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which \u00a376.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area's economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government's and Ministry of Defence's final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/|title=Highlands and Islands Enterprise|work=hie.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc HBOS, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215136/http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===National governments===\nElgin is in the [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray (Westminster) constituency]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom Parliament]] which returns a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]],<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm UK Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415085304/http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].\n{{Clear}}\n\nElgin is in the [[Moray (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Moray constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm Scottish Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124424/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm |date=30 April 2011 }}</ref> which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.

These wards are Elgin North and Elgin South.\n\n==Transport==\nElgin is situated on the A96 trunk route which connects the cities of [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]]. Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister [[Tavish Scott]] visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin's streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]]. [[Elgin railway station]] is operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. The railway also connects to Aberdeen and Inverness which have trains to other UK destinations. Elgin's bus station is operated mainly by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], and provides services within Elgin and to other local towns as well as to Aberdeen and Inverness.

It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the [[River Lossie]] on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and serves the community to this day.  Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a [[royal burgh]] in the 12th century by King [[David I of Scotland]], and by that time had a castle on top of the present day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The people of Elgin are collectively known as Elginites. The origin of the name Elgin is likely to be Celtic, it may derive from 'Aille' literally signifying beauty, but in topography a beautiful place or valley<ref>The Place names of Elginshire by Donald Matheson. Pg.139</ref>. Another possibility is 'ealg', meaning both 'Ireland' and 'worthy'.<ref>Mackay, George, 2000. Scottish Place Names</ref> The termination 'gin' or 'in' are Celtic endings signifying little or diminutive forms, hence Elgin could mean beautiful place, worthy place or little Ireland.\n==History==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn August 1040, [[Macbeth of Scotland|MacBeth's]] army defeated and killed [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart.<ref>Burgh Records of Scotland, Vol I, Preface, p.35</ref> David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]]. During David's reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] in 1224 when he granted the land for a new [[cathedral]] to Andrew, [[Bishop of Moray]]. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]]. Elgin was a popular residence for the early [[Scotland|Scottish]] monarchs: [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[William I of Scotland|William I]], [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.\n\nOf these kings, Alexander II was Elgin's greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Blackfriars on the west side and the [[Franciscans]] or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.<ref>Mackintosh, Herbert B: Elgin Past and Present, Elgin, 1914 p. 44</ref>\n[[File:Scotland Elgin Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Elgin Cathedral]]\nOn 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new [[Elgin Cathedral]] was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as \"Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom\".\n\n[[Edward I of England]] travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the [[Cotton library]] now held in the [[British Library]] is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as \"bon chastell et bonne ville\" \u2014 good castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle's wooden interior had been burned while held by the [[England|English]] governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at [[Kinloss Abbey]] from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland's cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to [[Orkney]], then to [[Norway]], only to return after Robert Bruce's victories against the English. After Edward's death in July 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] retook Scotland in 1308, [[slighting]] castles to keep them out of English hands. David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray at the head of his army, joined with Bruce and they slighted the castles of [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]] and [[Forres]] before seizing and slighting Kinneddar Castle, which also housed English soldiers. He attacked Elgin castle to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding.\n\nIn August 1370 [[Alexander Bur]], [[Bishop of Moray]] began payments to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], Wolf of Badenoch, [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III's]] brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by \"wyld, wykked Heland-men\". The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.\n\n===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===\n[[File:Elgin cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Elgin Cathedral]]\nThe citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]]. The lead was to be sold and the proceeds to go to the maintenance of Regent Moray's soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to [[Holland]] sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and [[Clan Brodie#17th century and Civil War|Alexander Brodie of Brodie]], all ardent [[Covenanters]], removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper's house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. John was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities, it is now in Elgin Museum, he is also honoured with a large tombstone in the eastern Cathedral precincts.\n\nWhen [[Daniel Defoe]] toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:<blockquote>In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim'd it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur'd miles [725&nbsp;km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Defoe1727\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Divided Into Circuits Or Journies.

Graves|pages=193\u2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe cathedral is known as the ''Lantern of the North.'' When Bishop Bur wrote to [[King Robert III]], complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King's brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as \"the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.\" Chambers, in his ''Picture of Scotland'', says: <blockquote>It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.</blockquote>Lachlan Shaw in his ''History of the Province of Moray'' was equally impressed when he wrote<blockquote>the church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.</blockquote>\n\n[[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king's army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs. Anderson, a passionate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], one of the Prince's generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: <blockquote>Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you'll write to Mr. Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can ...</blockquote>\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Dr Grays Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dr Grays Hospital]]\nIn the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of [[Freemasons]], at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr. Gray's Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr. Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], endowed \u00a326,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of \u00a310,000. Lt. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed \u00a370,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institute was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and 10 elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum in 1842 and the County Buildings in 1866.\n\nThe [[Morayshire Railway]] was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and [[Lossiemouth]] on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only  {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway's return to solvency from crippling debt. The railway and Lossiemouth harbour became very important to Elgin's economy.\n\nThe town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper. It was not until the 20th century, however, that the separate villages of Bishopmill and New Elgin would be incorporated into the town.\n\nThe [[Cooper Park drill hall, Elgin|Cooper Park drill hall]] was completed in 1908.<ref name=canmore>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/331416/elgin-cooper-park-drill-hall|title=Elgin, Cooper Park, Drill Hall|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south.\n[[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]] rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of [[aeolian sandstone]] formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town's edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie's Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the [[Elgin Reptiles]]. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin's town center, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Elgin Panorama 01.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Elgin from the northern spire of [[Elgin Cathedral]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\nElgin's climate is [[temperate]] [[Maritime climate|maritime]], with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the [[rain shadow]] of mountains to the west and southwest.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Elgin, elevation: {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981-2010

8460</small>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{for|economy of Moray|Moray}}\n\nThe Elgin \u2013 Forres \u2013 Lossiemouth triangle is heavily dependent on [[Royal Air Force]] stations for the employment of civilians. In 2005, [[RAF Lossiemouth]] along with its neighbour [[RAF Kinloss]] contributed \u00a3156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which \u00a376.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area's economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government's and Ministry of Defence's final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/|title=Highlands and Islands Enterprise|work=hie.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc HBOS, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215136/http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===National governments===\nElgin is in the [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray (Westminster) constituency]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom Parliament]] which returns a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]],<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm UK Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415085304/http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].\n{{Clear}}\n\nElgin is in the [[Moray (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Moray constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm Scottish Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124424/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm |date=30 April 2011 }}</ref> which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.

These wards are Elgin North and Elgin South.\n\n==Transport==\nElgin is situated on the A96 trunk route which connects the cities of [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]]. Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister [[Tavish Scott]] visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin's streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]]. [[Elgin railway station]] is operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. The railway also connects to Aberdeen and Inverness which have trains to other UK destinations. Elgin's bus station is operated mainly by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], and provides services within Elgin and to other local towns as well as to Aberdeen and Inverness. There is a 'Jet' bus service which runs to the [[Inverness Airport]] at Dalcross, Inverness has flights to mainly UK destinations while [[Aberdeen Airport]] has UK and international flights.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Elgin, Gordon Street, Moray College Of Further Education.jpg|thumb|Moray School of Art]]\n\n===Nursery schools===\n* Ark Childcare, Mosstowie\n* Jack 'n' Jill Pre-School Centre, Kinder House, 22 Wardend Place, New Elgin\n* Moray Leisure Centre Pre-School Nursery, Borough Briggs Road, Elgin\n* Magic Roundabout Pre-School Nursery, Thornhill Drive, Elgin\n*St Sylvesters Nursery\n*Bishopmill Nursery\n*Seafield Nursery\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Bishopmill Primary School, Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* East End Primary School, Institution Road\n* Greenwards Primary School, Edgar Road, New Elgin\n* New Elgin Primary School, Bezack Street, New Elgin\n* Seafield Primary School, Deanshaugh Terrace, Bishopmill\n* West End Primary School, Mayne Road\n* St Sylvester's RC Primary School, Abbey Street\n\n===Secondary schools===\n* [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]], Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* [[Elgin High School (Scotland)|Elgin High School]], High School Drive, New Elgin\n\n===Further education===\n* [[Moray College]], Moray Street, Elgin, Moray\n\n==Community care==\n\n===Hospitals===\n* [[Dr Gray's Hospital]]\n\n===Health centres===\n* The Maryhill Health Centre.\n* Linkwood Medical at the Glassgreen Centre (Formerly the Victoria Crescet Medical Centre before its relocation in 2009)\n* Elgin Community Surgery, Highfield House.\n\n===Hospice===\n* [[The Oaks, Elgin|The Oaks Hospice]], Sherrifmill\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Elgin.jpg|thumb|St Giles church in Elgin's town centre]]\n\nThe following denominations have places of worship in Elgin:\n\n'''[[Church of Scotland]]'''\n* St Giles', High Street\n* St Columba's South, Moss Street\n* Birnie Kirk, A941, Elgin \n* Elgin High, North Guildry Street\n'''[[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]'''\n* Free Church, South Street\n'''[[Baptist Union of Scotland]]'''\n* Elgin Baptist Church, Reidhaven Street<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070125003856/http://www.elginbaptistchurch.co.uk/ Elgin Baptist Church]</ref>\n'''Roman Catholic Church'''\n* St Sylvester's, Institution Road\n* [[Greyfriars Sisters of Mercy Convent in Elgin]]\n'''[[Scottish Episcopal Church]]'''\n* Holy Trinity, Trinity Place<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090729093237/http://www.episcopalmoray.org.uk/elgin.htm Holy Trinity]</ref>\n'''Other denominations'''\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Pansport Road\n* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], Linkwood\n* Calvary Christian Life Centre, Lesmurdie Road\n* [[True Jesus Church]], Lesmurdie Road\n* [[Pentecostal Church of God]], New Elgin Hall Annex\n* [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]], Riverside Gospel Hall, North Street\n* Oasis Church COTN, The Hub, Tyock Industrial Estate<ref>[http://www.oasischurchelgin.co.uk/ Oasis Church]</ref>\n\n== Culture and leisure==\n* Elgin Museum, 1 High Street\n* Elgin Library, Cooper Park\n* Elgin Golf Club, Hardhillock, Birnie Road\n* Glassgreen Golf Range, Birnie Road\n* Cooper Park: boating, pitch and putt, tennis\n* Biblical Gardens\n* Moray Leisure Centre, Borough Briggs Road, containing swimming pool, ice rink and a gymnasium\n*Moray Sports Centre, Linkwood\n* Town Hall with auditorium for production of shows\n* Community Centre, Trinity Road: badminton\n* The Lantern Gallery, 18 South Guildry Street\n* Red Shoes Theatre and music venue, High Street\n* Elgin Youth Caf\u00e9, Francis Place\n* Moray Jazz Club, ground floor of the Elgin City Football Club, Borough Briggs Road\n\n==Music==\nDuring the 1960s [[The Beatles]], [[The Who]], [[Pink Floyd]],<ref>[http://tworedshoes.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/pink-floyd-ttrs.jpg Image of Two Red Shoes Ballroom poster featuring Pink Floyd]</ref> [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] all performed at the Two Red Shoes dancehall,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1963/01/03/live-two-red-shoes-ballroom-elgin-scotland |title=Two Red Shoes Ballroom, Elgin, Scotland |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date=1963-01-03 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html \"Red Shoes future in doubt\"], Northern Scot  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727002629/http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html |date=27 July 2010 }}</ref> and [[The Kinks]] played Elgin Town Hall.
