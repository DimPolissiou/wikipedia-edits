He is given a second chance, however, when he learns that he has a 25-year-old daughter named Gigi ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]) with one of his former back up singers. Gigi moves to New York to try to make it as a musician. She comes up with a proposition: if her dad reforms The Heathens, she will replace him as lead singer, the band will change their name to The Assassins, and in return he will stay on board as lead songwriter for the band, as well as coach to Gigi. Johnny experiences the challenges of an aging rock star in a music landscape fueled by hip-hop and pop, as well as caring for someone other than himself for once with his newly found daughter now in his life.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #433f3e\n| link1      = #Season 1 (2015)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2015|7|16}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2015|9|15}}\n\n| color2     = #BFA3B6\n| link2      = #Season 2 (2016)\n| episodes2  = 10\n| start2     = {{Start date|2016|6|30}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2016|9|1}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2015)===\n{{Episode table|background=#433f3e|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|viewers=|country=US|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Don't Wanna Die Anonymous\n |DirectedBy = Michael Blieden\n |WrittenBy = [[Denis Leary]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|16}}\n |Viewers = 0.87<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=Thursday Cable Ratings: 'Teen Mom II' Tops Night + 'Lip Sync Battle', 'Mountain Men', 'Braxton Family Values' & More|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/17/thursday-cable-ratings-teen-mom-ii-tops-night-lip-sync-battle-mountain-men-braxton-family-values-more/432138/|accessdate=August 1, 2015|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Johnny ([[Denis Leary]]) sees a girl staring at him in a bar and walks up to kiss her, only to learn (after being slapped in the face and kneed in the balls) that she is his daughter Gigi ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]), which he never knew he had. On the verge of being dropped by his agent, Ira, Johnny mulls over his last remaining options as a singer: the [[Bryan Adams]] tribute band \"Summer of '69\" or another one called \"[[Bon Jovi|Jon Non Jovi]]\". But things take a different turn when Gigi, an aspiring singer, offers $200,000 for Johnny and his former Heathens' guitarist Flash ([[John Corbett]]) to write some songs for her. The only problem is that Johnny and Flash aren't on speaking terms, each blaming the other for breaking up the band back in 1990, while Flash also hints at attempting to sleep with Gigi. The group gets together at the end just to see if Gigi is as good as she says or if she is just bluffing for their attention. The band plays their former hit song 'Animal' and both Johnny and Ira are stunned by Gigi's singing as they realize their new opportunity to get back into showbiz.\n\nSongs featured: \"Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll\" (feat.

Rehab ([[John Ales]]) and Bam Bam ([[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]]) have already signed the contract. Flash has also signed it, but says it's not for the money as he is already successful enough. After a night of drugs and drinking, which he spent in the studio before passing out, Johnny offers the basic riff and melody for a song. Flash adds a hook and helps with the lyrics. The test run with Gigi singing the new song \"Die Tryin'\" goes well, and the band starts rehearsing and recording the song. With one song down and four to go, Johnny is blindsided by a sort of intervention held by the band members while the band's agent reveals a clause in the contract that stipulates Johnny must be sober, no drinking and definitely no drugs for at least 30 days. Johnny argues that \"all the great ones\" wrote their best stuff while under the influence, but the group still tries to keep him clean. When the next song he writes is awful, the group allows him to go back to drinking and drugs...\"but no cocaine\".\n\nSong featured: \"Die Tryin'\" by [[Elizabeth Gillies]] (feat.

Gigi asks Johnny if he loves her and they get into a small argument when he hesitates to answer her question. A website publishes a story that Johnny died from choking on a chicken bone, so Ira and the band decide to let the rumors circulate for a little while, as it would be good for Gigi's career. While trying to come up with creative stories for how Johnny \"died\", Johnny suggests he was killed by his partner Flash, with Bam Bam saying \"like an assassination\". This leads Gigi to decide that The Assassins would be a good name for her band. [[Joan Jett]] makes an appearance wishing Gigi good luck on her first gig, while also shining some light on Johnny's story that he once slept with her. She says they were both drunk, and that \"he couldn't quite...perform.\" Both fell asleep, and she only told him that she had a great time to get him out of her house.

The plan is for Gigi to sing three songs at the concert to introduce the Assassins. Gigi and Johnny have some father-daughter bonding time over music and being a rockstar. Flash and Gigi go out for lunch, where Flash proposes that the two should write music together and exclude Johnny, with the excuse that Johnny is holding Gigi back and will surely self-destruct at the gig. The group gets into a fight over the \"rock star treatment\" they want behind the scenes during the gig, making ridiculous requests. Gigi is upset by the stupidity of their requests, but the group still ends up with everything they want. During the gig, Johnny opens with \"Die Tryin'\", but halfway through the song, the drugs and booze kick in, he hallucinates a snake, and freaks out, leaving the stage empty and awkward. Gigi uses the moment to introduce The Assassins, continuing the song and taking over the gig. After the gig, the group sits in the limo where Flash and Ira attempt to drive Johnny out of \"Team Assassins\", but they are overruled in a power play by Gigi, leaving Flash shocked as he realizes that Gigi has just out-maneuvered him.\n\nSong featured: \"Die Tryin'\" by [[Elizabeth Gillies]] (feat.

He is given a second chance, however, when he learns that he has a 25-year-old daughter named Gigi ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]) with one of his former back up singers. Gigi moves to New York to try to make it as a musician. She comes up with a proposition: if her dad reforms The Heathens, she will replace him as lead singer, the band will change their name to The Assassins, and in return he will stay on board as lead songwriter for the band, as well as coach to Gigi. Johnny experiences the challenges of an aging rock star in a music landscape fueled by hip-hop and pop, as well as caring for someone other than himself for once with his newly found daughter now in his life.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #433f3e\n| link1      = #Season 1 (2015)\n| episodes1  = 10\n| start1     = {{Start date|2015|7|16}}\n| end1       = {{End date|2015|9|15}}\n\n| color2     = #BFA3B6\n| link2      = #Season 2 (2016)\n| episodes2  = 10\n| start2     = {{Start date|2016|6|30}}\n| end2       = {{End date|2016|9|1}}\n}}\n\n===Season 1 (2015)===\n{{Episode table|background=#433f3e|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|viewers=|country=US|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Don't Wanna Die Anonymous\n |DirectedBy = Michael Blieden\n |WrittenBy = [[Denis Leary]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|7|16}}\n |Viewers = 0.87<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=Thursday Cable Ratings: 'Teen Mom II' Tops Night + 'Lip Sync Battle', 'Mountain Men', 'Braxton Family Values' & More|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/07/17/thursday-cable-ratings-teen-mom-ii-tops-night-lip-sync-battle-mountain-men-braxton-family-values-more/432138/|accessdate=August 1, 2015|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|date=July 17, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Johnny ([[Denis Leary]]) sees a girl staring at him in a bar and walks up to kiss her, only to learn (after being slapped in the face and kneed in the balls) that she is his daughter Gigi ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]), which he never knew he had. On the verge of being dropped by his agent, Ira, Johnny mulls over his last remaining options as a singer: the [[Bryan Adams]] tribute band \"Summer of '69\" or another one called \"[[Bon Jovi|Jon Non Jovi]]\". But things take a different turn when Gigi, an aspiring singer, offers $200,000 for Johnny and his former Heathens' guitarist Flash ([[John Corbett]]) to write some songs for her. The only problem is that Johnny and Flash aren't on speaking terms, each blaming the other for breaking up the band back in 1990, while Flash also hints at attempting to sleep with Gigi. The group gets together at the end just to see if Gigi is as good as she says or if she is just bluffing for their attention. The band plays their former hit song 'Animal' and both Johnny and Ira are stunned by Gigi's singing as they realize their new opportunity to get back into showbiz.\n\nSongs featured: \"Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll\" (feat.

Rehab ([[John Ales]]) and Bam Bam ([[Robert Kelly (comedian)|Robert Kelly]]) have already signed the contract. Flash has also signed it, but says it's not for the money as he is already successful enough. After a night of drugs and drinking, which he spent in the studio before passing out, Johnny offers the basic riff and melody for a song. Flash adds a hook and helps with the lyrics. The test run with Gigi singing the new song \"Die Tryin'\" goes well, and the band starts rehearsing and recording the song. With one song down and four to go, Johnny is blindsided by a sort of intervention held by the band members while the band's agent reveals a clause in the contract that stipulates Johnny must be sober, no drinking and definitely no drugs for at least 30 days. Johnny argues that \"all the great ones\" wrote their best stuff while under the influence, but the group still tries to keep him clean. When the next song he writes is awful, the group allows him to go back to drinking and drugs...\"but no cocaine\".\n\nSong featured: \"Die Tryin'\" by [[Elizabeth Gillies]] (feat.

A website publishes a story that Johnny died from choking on a chicken bone, so Ira and the band decide to let the rumors circulate for a little while, as it would be good for Gigi's career. While trying to come up with creative stories for how Johnny \"died\", Johnny suggests he was killed by his partner Flash, with Bam Bam saying \"like an assassination\". This leads Gigi to decide that The Assassins would be a good name for her band. [[Joan Jett]] makes an appearance wishing Gigi good luck on her first gig, while also shining some light on Johnny's story that he once slept with her. She says they were both drunk, and that \"he couldn't quite...perform.\" Both fell asleep, and she only told him that she had a great time to get him out of her house.

The plan is for Gigi to sing three songs at the concert to introduce the Assassins. Gigi and Johnny have some father-daughter bonding time over music and being a rockstar. Flash and Gigi go out for lunch, where Flash proposes that the two should write music together and exclude Johnny, with the excuse that Johnny is holding Gigi back and will surely self-destruct at the gig. The group gets into a fight over the \"rock star treatment\" they want behind the scenes during the gig, making ridiculous requests. Gigi is upset by the stupidity of their requests, but the group still ends up with everything they want. During the gig, Johnny opens with \"Die Tryin'\", but halfway through the song, the drugs and booze kick in, he hallucinates a snake, and freaks out, leaving the stage empty and awkward. Gigi uses the moment to introduce The Assassins, continuing the song and taking over the gig. After the gig, the group sits in the limo where Flash and Ira attempt to drive Johnny out of \"Team Assassins\", but they are overruled in a power play by Gigi, leaving Flash shocked as he realizes that Gigi has just out-maneuvered him.\n\nSong featured: \"Die Tryin'\" by [[Elizabeth Gillies]] (feat.

Cat then reveals she thinks Gigi's career can explode if she's backed by a younger, hipper band. After cajoling Gigi and bribing Johnny with sex, Cat ultimately gets them to agree. They break the news to the Assassins, leaving the band to pursue the Ava X solo project with only one original song in their catalogue. Soon after, Ava does some research and finds that Cat's house in Ohio was foreclosed and that Cat is flat broke.

These rebel soldiers, on their way to reach Manipur, pitched their tents at Malegarh. A force of 160 company soldiers under Major Byng, initially reached Protaphgarh (now in India) and then Malegarh on December 19, 1857. In that battle, Major Byng and four other company soldiers lost their lives. The mutineers retreated leaving behind twenty-six rebels including Major Sher Khan and Captain Shamsher Khan. For those who lived long enough to make it to Manipur, they were attacked not only by the company soldiers but also Kuki scouts. Ali Baksh of Chittagong, one of the rebels, was caught and charged of desertion, robbery and revolt. Gonjer Ali of Protapgarh and Zamindar Gous Ali Khan of nearby Prithimpasha were accused of helping the rebels.\n\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, [[King George V]] announced the reunification of a [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal Province]] and the creation of an [[Assam Province]].

These rebel soldiers, on their way to reach Manipur, pitched their tents at Malegarh. A force of 160 company soldiers under Major Byng, initially reached Protaphgarh (now in India) and then Malegarh on December 19, 1857. In that battle, Major Byng and four other company soldiers lost their lives. The mutineers retreated leaving behind twenty-six rebels including Major Sher Khan and Captain Shamsher Khan. For those who lived long enough to make it to Manipur, they were attacked not only by the company soldiers but also Kuki scouts. Ali Baksh of Chittagong, one of the rebels, was caught and charged of desertion, robbery and revolt. Gonjer Ali of Protapgarh and Zamindar Gous Ali Khan of nearby Prithimpasha were accused of helping the rebels.\n\nAt the [[Delhi Durbar]] on 12 December 1911, [[King George V]] announced the reunification of a [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal Province]] and the creation of an [[Assam Province]].
