Alphonse is a child who lost his body during an alchemical experiment to bring his deceased [[Trisha Elric|mother]] back to life and had his soul attached to a suit of armor by his older brother [[Edward Elric|Edward]]. As a result, Alphonse is almost invulnerable as long as the armor's seal is not erased, but is unable to feel anything. To recover their bodies, the Elrics travel around their country Amestris to obtain the Philosopher's Stone{{mdash}}an alchemical object that could restore them. He is voiced by [[Rie Kugimiya]] in the animated films and series and by Atomu Mizuishi in the live action film and by Seiru as his younger self in the live action film.\n\nAs a result of appearing in the series mostly in his armor, Arakawa has been focused on searching ways to make it appear as Alphonse is expressing emotions despite not having a body. Alphonse has also appeared in materials related to the manga, including video games and [[light novel]]s that follow his journey. His character has been well received by readers of the series; he has consistently appeared in the top ten series' popularity polls. The character has received positive remarks from critics, with some commending his design and his relationship with Edward.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Alphonserealbody.jpg|thumb|right|Alphonse's original body.

Alphonse is a child who lost his body during an alchemical experiment to bring his deceased [[Trisha Elric|mother]] back to life and had his soul attached to a suit of armor by his older brother [[Edward Elric|Edward]]. As a result, Alphonse is almost invulnerable as long as the armor's seal is not erased, but is unable to feel anything. To recover their bodies, the Elrics travel around their country Amestris to obtain the Philosopher's Stone{{mdash}}an alchemical object that could restore them. In the [[anime|animated]] adaptations of ''Fullmetal Alchemist'', Alphonse is voiced by [[Rie Kugimiya]] in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by [[Aaron Dismuke]] in the first series and by [[Maxey Whitehead]] in the second.\n\nAs a result of appearing in the series mostly in his armor, Arakawa has been focused on searching ways to make it appear as Alphonse is expressing emotions despite not having a body. Alphonse has also appeared in materials related to the manga, including video games and [[light novel]]s that follow his journey. His character has been well received by readers of the series; he has consistently appeared in the top ten series' popularity polls. The character has received positive remarks from critics, with some commending his design and his relationship with Edward.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Alphonserealbody.jpg|thumb|right|Alphonse's original body.
